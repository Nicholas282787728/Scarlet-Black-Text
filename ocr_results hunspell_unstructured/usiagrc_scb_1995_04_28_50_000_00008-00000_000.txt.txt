dent body. Our initiative picked up
295 yeas and so nays but not enough
students voted to meet the requisite
twenty-ﬁve percent needed. As Dia-
mond Joe Quimby once said, “You
people make me sick.” You make us
sick too. And we're not talking about
diarrhea (cha-cha-cha).

Lucky for you (and too bad for
our enemies), there will still be an
additional serving of the chicken patty
pannesan meal in the rotation next
year. Why? Because OUR FOUR
VOTES COUNTMORETHAN EV»
ERY SINGLE ON'E OFYOU‘RS PUT
TOGETHER. Ahhh, despotism.
Mmmmmmm ego.

After McConnell stopped I ughr
ing about the fact that our ini ative
failed, we engaged him, Barb Shell
and Jeanette Moser (who aren‘t hired
goons) in intense negotiations that
would have made Jimmy Caner jeal»
ous. The hired goons were outside the
smoke-filled room (we told Jed not to
barbecue his tofu in there, but he
wouldn‘t listen) keeping the media
and college administration at bay.

AfterMattlostabestoutofthirly-
nine arm wrestling competition to
Moser in twenty rounds, we decided to
resorttorheton'ctogetourpolntacross.
Matt started wtth a speech about the
moral. ethical. ontological, mempliysir
cal and gastronomical implications of
serving CPP an additional time. After
a couple of hours, Jon woke everyone
up with a start when his intestinal
uproar made him yell “safety.”

McConnell, Shell and Moser just
sat there and stared at Jon, completely
dumbfounded. After] on settled down
and stopped giggling, the negotiations
resumed. The mood was tense and it
didn’t help when Jason leapt up onto
the table and screamed “Give me CPP
or give mcdeathl” As part ofthe final
agreement reached with Dining Ser-
Vices, we are not allowed to disclose

ensuing attelnpt on Jason's life. But
rest assured that everyone is ﬁne, no
charges are being pressed and we're
still planning on vacationing together
in Hershey,Pennsylvaniaaftergradu»
ation,

At this point, the tension was so
duck thatyou could cut itwith a knife.
And actually. bateled did so with the
bat-knife on his bat~utllity batrbelt.
Suddenly, everything was batter (or
was itbetter'? Bitter? Butter? Ican‘t
believe it‘s not butter),

Tile ﬁrst real sign of progress in
the negotiations came when we of~
feted McConnell a role in our titular
head movie (tonight at Harris). First,
we offered him a cameo and he counr
tered with an offer of mostaccioli, egg-
plant parmesan and sliced beets. “Unr
acceptable," we all said in unison.
“Why should the vegetarians prosper
while we suffer?”

We then upped our offer to a
starring role for Dave. HIS ego took
over and he melted tn our hands like

butter. Or was that bitter? Better? I -

cztn’t believe it’s not butter. We all
rejoiced and ate our favorite desens in
celebration. Jon had a four layer des—
sert, Matt had apple pie a lamode, Jed
had strawberry Shortcake and Jason
had blueberry pie. McConnell had a
glazed raised donut whilc Moscr and
Shell split a gallon can of candied
yams.

Remember to thank us for provid
ing you, our fellow Grinnellians, with an
em? nightofecslasy beginning next fall.
chon'tbchere, but we felt it imponant
to leave a legacy, It is a scatological,
fetishobsessod nightmare World we live
i but it‘s worth it to see you smile.

Chileans don’t distinguish between different time

periods, genres in American, European music

By KEVIN GARCIA
studying in Santiago, Chile

RANTED. Iltaveonly been
in Santiago,Chile,forfour
weeks but already I have

found one of those rare quirks that
one runs into when traveling to for-
eign locations. For simplicity’ssako,
I will call this quirk the music phe-
nomenon It seems as though Chile
eans (as well as Mexicans) do not
distinguish between different time
periods nor genres of music that
comes from the United States. Fur-
thermore, it seems as tltough Chile
eans prefer American or European
music over their own music (could
this be another form of

subtle manipulation by “It is virtually impossible to distin—
guish or label people [in Chile]
was seated at the dinner according to the type of music that

the CIA77 Probably ).
For example, as I

table trying to finish my

homewom 1 was betng they listen to ( which can be done

“Grease Lightning”

This list docs not include any of
the five or SIX Latin American songs
nor litany of the numerous cheesy
remakes ct‘Elvis Presley, U2 or any
songrromthc 1960s thatwcre played
duringthlstlmc frame. Incidentally,
all the time that these songs were
playing.my“mother"couldbehcurd
whistling loudly throughout the
house in a bold and erratic way add-
ing a tremendous vibratto to tlte
whistle that would sometimes slip
and slide between a four or ﬁve note
spun.

It was absolutely impossible to
gctintoztnytypeofgroovewnh such
a huge gap between styles being

continuallydistractedby fairly easily in the US. A. )l’

the awesome viewlhavc

ofthe city from the fourth ﬂoor of a
huge apartment complex At the
momenl,1was watching yetanother
spectacular sunset (due to the wane
derful smog we have created down
here) and by the radio station that I
was listening to. Duringa two hour
segment ofone channel, I heard the
following music from the following
groups:

Cranberries , “Zombie"

Depeche Mode , 7

Led Zepplin - “Rock and Roll"
Beatles , four or ﬁve differentsongs
AirSupplyJ'lheOneihatYoulove"
?-“I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing"
Barry Manilow . "Ships"
Michael Jackson - two songs
Beastie Boys - 7

Olivia Newton John A ?

And excerpts from the soundtrack

played. When tlte Cranberries came
on, I felt a melancholy urgc start to
envelope me. Rich images ofhome
and of cenain friends stanedto flood
my mind without me being able to
stop it.

However, when the Beastie
Boys started ranting and ravingabout
nothing in their childish, attentions
starved way, I was thrown into the
cold reality of how shallow life can
be. My mother, however. was unaf-
fected by thcsudden changeintempo
and mood and continued whistling
in her own characteristic way ya
gotta love her!

This type of clash can also be
found in many of the restaurants.
buses, subway stations. etc. No mat-
ter what style of establishment or
tran portatton oneisin d ed to

question my familymembersabout
this contradiction.

My “brother" Max (my only
informanti'orthisarticle)cxplaincd
away the phenomenon neatly and
concisely by saying that all Chile
eans value all oftheir family meme
bersyoung and old. Forthisreason
they recognize the importance and
beauty ofsongs from all the differ-
ent epocas. The older generations
respectlhcwildandenergeticsongs
of the youth and likewise. the
younger generations LEARN to
appreciate the songs of the older
generations foroneoftwo reasons:

I. Theysimply like the melo-
dies.

2. The songs re-
mind the childrcn of
their parents or grand-
parents.

After finishing

his long wmded speech
(I only included the
abridged version), he
lowered his voice and
wtnked at me saying, “actually
Kcveen. all the songs sound the
same to us. We can‘t understand a
damn word they are saying nor do
we know anything about the culr
ture from which these songs origie
nate from,"

Needless to say, it is vinually
impossible to distinguish or label
people according to the type of
musicthalthcy listen to (which can
be done fairlyeztsily in theU S.A,).
Overall, Chileans aren‘t very pars
ttcular to what type of mustc is
beingplayedovertheairwaves here
in Santlago.
