Difficult nature.

Twent ine years have passed
since "Cyrano de Bergerac” was prer
sented for the first time in Paris at
the Theatre de la Porte Saint—Martin.

Twent nine years during which
this old World has suffered chills and
fevers, bloodied its nose with un-
knightly brawls and emerged bruised
but rel, little wiser.

Yet to-da)‘ “Cyrano de Bergerac" is
still a gallant gesture in front 01' the
cynical gallery of spectators. Modern
youth is not too hard or too metallic
to thrill to the passanges of breathless
beauty in Rostaud's verse, to applaud
the chivalrous deed or clever retort,
to feel its blood quicken at the sound
of: ”A hundred against one!"

D’ ‘icult Drama To Present

There is something "not of an age
but for all time " in “Cyrano de Berg-
erac" and it is for this reason that the
Dramatic club has attempted the
somewhat Herculean task of present-
ing Rostand’s heroic comedy before a
college audience. In so doing the club
has had as its object the sincere de-
sire to offer to Grinnell a play which
is to be seen all too infrequently in
the United States, a play which has
already Lhe aura of immortality about
it, not only because of its own beauty,
but because of the great names which
have been associated with its presen—
tation, the noblc traditions which hale
low its every perlormance.

The sponsors of the play have real-
ized from the beginning the gargan-
tuan lahors which were necessary if
their venture were to be successful.
They have had no Coquelin, no Mans-
field. They have had no company
skilled in the rendition of romantic
drama.

Cast Has Shown Enthusiasm

Yet the directors of “Cyrano” have
had youth at their disposal, and for
four of its acts “Cyrano fle Bergerac”

orinncll Itecenes Gull of Twenty
Scholarships For Men rrorn
\ rermeyl'orurdution.

Presideut Main announces today the
founding at Grinllell of twenty schol-
arships for men, through a gift from
the J. C. Penney Foundation, estab-
lishcd by J. c. Penney, of New York,
originator of the system of chain-
storcs which bears his name.

It is the purpose of the Penny schol-
arships to aid men who are in need of
help during their college years and
who are following a definite plan of
vocational guidance through tlleir col-
lege studies and vacation work. The
system of vocational guidance now be-
ing developed at Grinnell by Dean of
Men, James F. Findlay, is in direct bc-
cord with the purpose of these new
scholarships, and with the help that
will be provided through them the
beneficiaries will have every oppor-
tunity for success.

Five full scholarships will he avail-
able for freshmen next tall, and five
half scholarships to men in each of
the three other classes, with the priv-
ilege of borrowing the remainder it :t
is necessary. Applications may be
made to Dean Findlay.

The tendency to encourage educa-
tion through loans rather than out—
right gifts is shown in this plan, which
ls also the plan of the Harmon Found-
ation, in making loans to Grinnell stu-
dents. The Maltese Cross Loan Fund,
established one year ago through a
gift of $10,000 lrom D. w. Norris, '115,
and a similar amount from the class
of 1925, carries out n similar principle.
