Iowa pOt laws harshest in nation

from Iowa NOR/vii News

For the first time in ten years, Iowa
lawmakers will consider sweeping
revisions of penalties for marijuana
possession and sale. Revealing
skyrocketing marijuana arrests and
enforcement costs at a Des Moines
news conference, the National
Organization for the Reform on Mari-
juana Laws (NORML) called for a
“cease fire" on arrests of smokers

and an end to penalties which are “the
harshest in the nation."

”Iowa is the only state where a
penitentiary term is mandatory for
sale of a small amount of marijuana,"
said Peter Meyers of Washington,
D,C., NORML's Chief Counsel. Meyers
said 1970 was the last time most
states, including Iowa, made
wholesale revisions of marijuana
laws.

Mandatory sentences would be lifted
for marijuana law violations if a pro-
posal before the Iowa Senate is ap-
proved. tS.R 360)

“Iowa marijuana laws are out of
step with the times. Nearly four thou-
sand marijuana smokersﬁnot
sellers—are arrested each year in
Iowa at a cost of almost four million
dollars. We must stop arresting
smokers and focus law enforcement
resources on real crime." said lowa
NORML legislative director and lob-
byist Julie Golden. _

NORML’s proposals would become
law with the passage of amendments
introduced which would substitute
traffic ticketrlike citations in lieu of
arrest, jail and permanent criminal
records for marijuana smokers,

lowa NORML successfully lobbyed
in 1979 to defeat proposed legislation
which would double penalties, for most
lowa marijuana smokers and with
wide-spread public support, guided in-
to law legalization of marijuana for
medicine. ‘
