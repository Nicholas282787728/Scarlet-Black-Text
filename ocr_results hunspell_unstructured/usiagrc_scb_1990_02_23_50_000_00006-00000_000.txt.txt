Residence Hall
Considerations

As the administration begins to deal more directly with housing
problems and student overcrowding, the construction of a new dormitory
becomes more probable. Questions arise about me new dorm, The two
major concerns surround its location that it's construction maintain the
architectural integrity of the campus.

The latter issue is easily dealt with. No matter where the dorm is built,
a reasonable effort should be made to construct it in the traditional cottage
style architecture, and to tie it into the other dorms, rather than isolate it by
giving it a unique, but aberrant design.

The issue of location, however, is not so simple. There are several
factors to be considered. The most important of these is the effect of the
new dorm on campus resources and facilities. These facilities include
dining halls, laundry rooms, and computer rooms. It is of utmost
importance that before any decisions are made. time factors be taken into
consideration.

According to Dave McConnell. the new dorm will not add many
students to the food service board plan, but it has the potential to disrupt
the balance between Quad and Cowles. Many of the students to be placed
in the new dorm would otherwise beliving in offvcampus, college-owned
houses. Nearly one-third of these students are already on a board plan of
some sort. and generally caton board at Quad. Ifthe new dorm is built on
South, this balance will basically be maintained. If, however. the dorm is
built on North, it might increase the volume at Cowles beyond the dining
hall's ability to accommodate.

Given the current circumstances, it would seem that the new dorm
would best ﬁt on South Campus. Among the suggested locations, placing
the new hall perpendicular to Loose would be the most acceptable solution
to the current campus problems, as well as the least likely location to
disrupt campus life. However, no decisions should be made until the
impact of the new dorm on campus life has been examined.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Fix 3-2 Before Campus Suffers

To the editor,

Only admitra new class of'

Grinnellians every two out of three
years. Ridiculous? Yes! AND.
that is the point Only admitting
two-thirds the number of students
to Grinnell is just as ridiculous as
only offering one»sixth the number
of classes at Grinnell.

lam confidant that the “powers-

that-be" at Grinnell College,
trustees,administration,faculty,and
students alike, realize the serious
ness of the ridiculous mistake made
when 3—2 was adopted without
hiring additional faculty. and I am
confidantthatthesegroups willget
together and solve the problem
swiftly. Afterall, Grinnell College
is comprised of some of the best
minds in the country. Once thwe

minds realize that just as 3-2 was
needed to attract quality faculty to
Grinnell‘s campus, additional
faculty and classes are desperately
needed to attract quality students to
Grinnell‘s campus as the numberof
highaschool seniors nationwide
dramatically drops in the next five
years.

Writer Lied About Pro-Life Group

To the editor:

I am writing to express my ex-
treme displeasure with the story
about the Provlife Organization that
appeared in last week’s Scarlet and
Black written by Mr. Craig Wackcr.
Mr. Wacker has deliberately misr
represented the facts of the case
with the intent to mislead die pub-
lic. In addition to ﬁling charges
against Mr. Wacker with the
SPARC for violations ofjournalis-
tic ethics, I would like to take this
opportunity topointoutsomc of the
falsehoods within his article.

In the first place. nobody’s box
number was used without their
permission. I have back dated
computer mail to prove this if nec-
essary. Although Miss Walinski
and Miss Miller did not know the
exact contents of the memo mes-
sage prior to its publication, they
both did grant their permission for
the use of their box numbers in the
memo.

Secondly, I never told Mr.
Wackcr that Miss Walinski apr
preached mc expressing interest In
an administrative position in the
organization. His assertion thatl
did was a blatant lic, Also this

representative was his apparent
assertion that I only admitted to
writing the message after Miss
Millerdeniedit. linformedWacker
thatI was the authorof the message
in the first and only telephone inter-
View we engaged in.

Furthermore, Wacker’s general
theme, summarized in his last para-
graphimplyingthatnow everybody
is denying the existence of the or
ganizationiscompletely fallacious.
Wacker was told repeatedly that the

purpose of the message was to atr
uactintetested parties so thatagroup
could be formed. It is true that the
group is not formally organized at
this point. There was never any
question, however, that the group
would meetas soon as we had a list
of people who were interested.

In addition to the falsehoods
within his article, Wacker’s inter
view style was leading and antagor

I have been drafting this letter in

Regarding the organization of u

Ido believe in it. However. Ido not

Personally, I have made a very

(without reason) for the apparently
offensive notice in the MEMO—~
