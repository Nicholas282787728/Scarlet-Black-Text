THE REASONS WHY - -

students may come and students
may go brit institutions seem to
stay around awhile, They stay
around a while because they
serve a purpose or serve a real
need. Just such an institution is
the nomination convention and
the election for a student Coun-
cil President.

We hear on all sides of us the
comment that the election this
year will not be important, that
any elected candidate will carry
on in the best of his or her abilr
ity so why should we put our-
selves out in the matter of cam-
paigning, working up interest and
backing the whole election pro-
cedure with our interest and
Votes? There are about three
corking good answers to such a
query.

The nomination and the clear
tion of a student council pres
dent is an institution on the Gl'in-
ncll campus. As such, it has
served the purpose of democ
racy for many many years. The
campaign brings out issues and
personalities that inject Vitality
and interest into student govern-
ment and campus life. Now is the
time to drag out all the accumur
lated gripes and plans, give them
an airing and turn them over to
your candidate to take before the
student body. We all realize that
next year will be another year of
transition, another year of great
changes in the life of Grinnell, a
year of great decisions: we must
carry that thought one step fur-
ther and choose the best possible
candidate to lead us through the
tough year. The Grmnell “social
problem" .or what to do with
your Saturday nights, plans for
an adequate “White House" or
recreational center,thc working
out of an honor system, in short,
the successful working out of all
the plans for next year that are
buzzing around now, will depend,
to a considerable degree, on the
candidate we choose now.

Like most good institutions,
the nomination and election have
an added attraction Don’t tell the
political science theorists but the
whole affair is more fun than a
barrel of monkeys, Thc smoky,
tense, and gay atmosphere lends
itself admirably to political in-
trigue and lively entertainment.
What upperclassman WlII ever
forget the "Pinky" Pearce;
“Rocky” Hampton campaign with
its shady background and power
politics. And the KaloupeckiPat-
terson affair when a joke went

A good Sized collegersoldlm turn-
out was on hand Thursday night
to soc Cowles win the allrsLar
game and heat Read by a score
of 30-21. Thc first half was
dominated by the advanced langr
“age boys. A slow, cautious style
of play netted them a 13-6 lead
at half time.

The first few minutes, marked
by some sloppy passes went
scoreless until Joc King, at ceri-
ter for the language team, sank
the first basket. Hour-ct quickly
followed up with another two
points, working a fast break
beautifully. Read came back but
their shooting was erratic and
they could not make much head-
way against their opponents
congested zone defense. Near
the end of the quarter Madole,
a cowles guard and one of its
outstanding players, took the
ball off the bank board and
passed out to Moushey. Moushey‘s
push effort from the corner was
good and comes led 6-0. The
quarter ended with Vincent miss-
ing a lay-up for Read.

At the opening of the second
stanza stern raised the ante with

,a set shot and King followed up

with a free throw. Finally Len
broke the ice for the
engineers with a pair of penalty
heaves. King on the end of a
fast break countered with a lay
up, but Ketchcm scored Read's
first field goal with a nice pivot
shot. Another fast break with
Muushey making the bucket gave
Cowles a 13-4 lead. Ketchem’s
one pointer closed the half with
the e')gilleers behind 1375.

The third quarter was an cri-
tirely different ball game. Fast,
ragged play gave the engineer’s
the edge as they rolled in 10
points to Cowles' 4, coming to
Within two points of the leaders.
Iwanski's set effort and Hols-
knecht's one handed push shot
sank four points for Read before
the language boys began to react.
The language outfit came back
as Houret sank a lay up and a

‘penalty throw and King added

a one pointer. But Read was still
in the ball game. Vincent's foul
throw and Huber’s field goal
brought the basics up to within
two points of a tie at the quare
ter's end, with Cowles still on
top 17—15.

The last quarter was a repe-
tition of the first half with
cowies in control of the situa
tion.

We Lose Army - ~

Manpower
'- ~ for Paper Drive

The sclicrlrilcd exodus oi thc

army from Griuncli is going to
raise a problem entirely different
from the expectcd social (liIIlZuIr
ties In the licld of physical lae
bor Glinllcll is going to feel the
effects of the manpower short-
age.

Until now soldiers have taken
care of the haling of paper col-
lected fiom the collegc and army
lor the scrap drive. The question
now befoie the wai serVice cou-n-
cil is who will operate thc bal-
rng machine after the army
leaves.

A check on the bahng opera-
tioii shows that it now takes
three soldiers six hours a day to
bale 200 pounds of papci. The
war service council is wondoiing
if women can operate the ma-
chine or if Macy will have to
take over, The paper has to ho
baled, but the college doesn't
know who will be doing the job
after the army leaves. In other
words, after March Siwhat?
