To the editor of the SCARLET AND

BLAC

With the appearance or the 1930 Cy-
clone set tor the near iuture, it scams
imperative that the iaculty and stu-
dents oi Grinuell college should
know this tact: that unless they
help put across this year's annual in
the only way that such assistance
can’ be given, a Crinnell institution
oi nearly thirty years seems doomed
ior an untimely end.

For the past tew years there has
been an increasing lethargy on the
campus concerning the Cyclone.
Many individuals who, it th - realiz-
ed'their personal responsibility in
the matter. would back the annual,
have passed up the publication for
reasons ltnown only to them. The re-
sult has been a slow but certain

students who have previously made
an annual possible.

Some oi these people undoubtedly
do not realize the peculiar position
iin which the Cyclone is placed. It
[operates on a re small margin.
The expenses in.puhlishing an annual
come almost entirely on the first
iew hundred copies printed, and on
lthose the financial burden is enorm-
ous. in most schools publishing an-
nuals of the uniiorm quality that
Grinnell does there is a student body
,suiiicient to absorb not only these
‘tirst tow hundred, but many other
lhundrsds or copies. Such a condi»
‘tion does not exist here; hence at
d‘erinnell the cooperation ot at least

135 per cent of the taculty and stu-

 

universities and colleges all over the
land would rate the spirit ot a Cole
lege like Grinnell if the iacnlty and
students oi Grinnell couldn't seem to
arouse sutticient interest to kcep a
publication going which every other
college and university malrc a success
of.

Three solutions to the problem are
possible: (1) The taculty and stu-
dent body can get back of this year's
Cyclone and every other one that
tollows, that the yearbook may re-
main on a iirm foundation. (2)
They can continue their support as
at present, and thus make a much
cheaper and poorer annual necessary.
(3) They can let their support cone
tinue to drop, and thus drive the Cy-
clone iroin inc ileld of Cr—innell pub-
lications.

The real issue is: Does Grinnell
want a high quality annual or not?
The stair of this year's Cyclone have
attempted to produce such a boolr
and it Grinnell does want to revive
the yearbook. the opportunity will be
given within the next woelr. Even if
the school has lost interest in the
Cyclone ,though such a pessibility
seems too regretmble to be true. the
tact remains that this year‘s annual
board have had printed the usual
number or Cyclones due to contidencc
or the board in the cooperation or
the school. and the junior class and
annual board hope that the next

diminishing in the body of faculty and Week will show that such conﬁdence

has not been misplaced.
Very truly yours,
Edward D. Allen

Business Manager,
1930 Cyclone.

Campus Opinion .
- i
Questio Do you tavor comprehen-
sive examinations in major and min-
or subjects ior seniors in pretcrence
(u the present system?

Charles Foil: I would favor them if
the student would be given a chance
to study and do real research work

subjects ot their special interest, then
i should he in tavor oi such exams.
Such an arrangement would weed out
the students who come to college bee
cause ll is the thing ‘0 (IO, 0!‘ 13?:
cause it oticrs tour yoars ot mere
pleasure. Standards should be raised
by such a system,

Prof. Spmgue: Fairness at judg-
ment should demand that a student
be given opportunity to express his
best where he is strongest, and mani-
icstly his strength will lie in the
rields where his interest has led him
to major. Lindbergh might not pass
a lite-saving test in the water,

Due to a mi ntorprctation on the
part 0i (he interviewer, Rudolph
Gilbert was misstated in the inter-
view which appeared in the last
SCARLET AND BLACK. The error
occured in the statement about nerve
required (or his job. He meant that
nerve more than spiritual insight was
required in taking over the job rath-
er than in continuing to carry it out.

TO SHOW GRI‘N'NELL “AS IS”

A week-end in Grinnell with
nothing pressing except packing
for freshmen and sophomores and
a period when parents and alums
ni may see Grinnell in full swing
seems in prospect as the com-
mencement committee announces,
for the first time in years, that
underclassmen are urged to stay
for graduation exercises.

The invitation follows the dis-
covery that alumni come back
Wanting to see Grinnell as it is
during the school year and in
stead find only a campus and
some seniors. The new plan 31»
lows graduates to see Grinnell as
it is in 1929.

Students who accept the invita-

tiori can look upon the week-end

as a party with Grinnell college
as host. Nothing to do but explain

Grinnell of the present to alumni

and to see that visitors ﬁnd Grin-
zicll at her best. Then of course

there will be the opportunity to
see and hear some of the best per-
formances of the year. The glee
clubs and the Vespers choir give
concelts, the Commencement play

comes then, and an international
authority on peace is to speak.

Clone can even look the printer, on-
graver and photographer in the face.
And whereas the slow dropping oti
in these back or the yearbook in the
past has still lott that percentage
above the margin, the school has at
last reached the inevitable this year
and have backed the Cyclone to the
extent of only 65 per cent.

The junior class, who publish the
annual. believe in the annual as a
Grinnell institution. The class pub-
lishes it annually because, up to the
present, the great percentage of face
ulty and students have desired some
permanent record oi the year's. activi-
ties, something which would symr
bolize ior them Grinnoll's achieve-
ments and progress in a particular
year, something which would bring
ba‘ck the "human interest" side
oi campus life and make each year
stand out by itself. It is as a Grin-
nell institution, theretore, that the
Cyclone desires your support within
the next weolr.

Some there are who perhaps don’t
believe in the annual any longer. If
a consideration at its real purposes
and values will not convince them,
then they should consider-how high

Then. maybe. juniors and seniors
would try to achieve more in their
