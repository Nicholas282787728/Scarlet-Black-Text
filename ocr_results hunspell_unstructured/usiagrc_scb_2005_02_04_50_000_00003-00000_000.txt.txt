JR. Ewins loved his life. He loved music.
He loved his friends, his family and his faith.

on Saturday, January 22, James Robert
(J.R.) Ewins was killed in a car accident our
side ofDavenport, lowa. _

The sophomore was on his way back to
Grinnell from his home in Lincoln, Ill. Stu—
dents received news of his death in an email
from Dean for Student Life Jen Krobn that
evening. His was the second car accident fatal~
ity this academic year.

Students were both shocked and saddened
by the sudden news of his death, but when
asked about their friend, that‘s not the ﬁrst
thing they talk about. .

They talk about the fact the J.R. was ran»
dam and caring, and funny and kind.

“What I remember most is his smile," said
longtime friend Carly schnna ’06. “It was the
hugest, most brightest smile ever."

Many people remembered ].R.'s kindness
and easy-going attitude. “JR. was just an int
credible person," said Schuna. “He never said
anything bad about anyone,”

People remember the random acts of hilarr
ity that JR. instigated and carefully preserved.
He first met fellow Grinnellian Alex Leach ‘06
at the summer church camp they both attended
for many years. One summer, Leach was tied
up with handcuffs and duct tape and smeared
with shaving cream by fellow campers.

“JR. took, like, ten pictures of that," said
Leach, “and every time he was in a conversar
tion with me and any other person he would
offer to show those pictures. He kept those
with him all the time."

“...he felt like he belonged at
Grinnell..."

As fun~loving as he was, most friends also
noted that the biochemistry/ religious studies
double major was a diligent and hardworking
student. “The boy studied more than anybody
I have ever seen," said Sarah Smith ‘07.

Schuna remembers how she ﬁgured out
that JR. had developed a crush on her dur
ing his freshman year. “He would stop by my
room four times a day to ask for help with his
homework," she explained, “which was totally
ridiculous. l didn’t know anything about bios
chem. He was a biochem major."

JR. had known he wanted to attend Grin-
nell since his longtime friend Leach went the
year ahead ofhim and he had had the opporms

the scarlet and black

Acts of kindness

Friends rememberJ.R. Ewins for his humor, compassion and dedication to his family, friends and faith

inty to visit. He, prospied twice his senior year
in high school, and would visit with his family
in order ro watch Leach perform in campus a
capella groups. _

0n J.R.’s first prospie visit, Leach's first
year double was too small, and J.R. had not
where to sleep. Finally, a room down the hall
volunteered a basket chair. Though obviously
uncomfortable, according to Leach, R
complained.

He asked Leach for help
on the application, espe-
cially the essay, because he
thought he was a bad writer.
“It was like the blind lead
ing the blind,” said Leach,
who agreed to help him.
“I'm a terrible writer."

J.R. was, of course, ad
mitted, and well into his
second year he remained
sure that he belonged at Grinnell. Stephanie
Masta, the RLC for Norris, where J.R. lived,
remembered that he would comment fre
quently about how much he loved Grinnell
and how glad he was that he was there.

“He loved being an SA more
than anything else.“

While at Grinnell, JR. never hesitated to
throw himself into everything he did. “We had
this running joke,” said Masta. “Every time
we’d see him, we would just be like, ‘You look
so tired.'"J.R. was a member of Community
Chorus, an employee at Burling, andeperhaps
most importantly to himia Student Advisor.

Schuna, an SA when JR. was a freshman,
was partly responsible for inspiring him to be a
part ofstudent staffWhen Smith,then a friend
and classmate, announced that she wanted to
he an SA on Norris Second and would need a
cosSA, JR. jumped at the chance. She remem-
bers bringing it up in class one day and being
most impressed at J.R.’s willingness to live in
Norris again.

According to his friends, J.R.’s caring per-
sonality made him perfect for the position.
“He was really devoted to being an SA," said
Smith. “He really liked being able to be there
for people and make a difrerence in their lives.
He just really wanted to do good for people."

Renee Lindeman ‘08 lived on J.R.'s floor
and was a fellow member of community
Chorus. She remembered J.R.’s eagerness to
help her and her new roommate move inf‘Hc

”He was really devoled lo being an
5A.. He really liked being able to be
there for people and make a dif-
ference in their Ill/er. Hejust really
wanted {0 do good for people.”

stopped by like four times that dayjust to see
ifwc needed help," she said.

He took his role as an SA seriously,but also
knew how to make the job fun.J.R. had wants
ed his floor theme to be Manly Python and 1/2:
Holy Grail. Halfway through first semester, he
changed his mind, and gave the ﬂoor a second
theme. “He picked another Monty Python
movie," said corSA Smith.

Being an SA was remit
niscent of one of J.R.‘s
great commitments of his
life: his work at a Baptist
summer camp, Leach rer
members that, before J.R.
was old enough to work as
an official camp counselor,
he had to work as a staff
person. Staff members
would ”work for terrible,
terrible pay. I think we
worked it out and you made like two dollars
an hour,” he said.J.R. took the job so that he
could be at camp when he was too old to be a
camper. According to Leach, J.R. got one week
offthe whole summer, and he spent it ﬁlling in
as a counselor.

Sarah Smith ’07

“You knew it mattered a lot to
him."

Part of J.R.’s commitment to camp came
from his commitment to his faith. A large
number of people from his church attended
the funeral, said Leach. J.R., though he was
raised a Baptist, became seriously committed
to his faith when he was between eighth and
ninth grade.

JR. served on the American Baptist Youth
Board for five years. When he was a junior in
high school, he had the opportunity to run for
President of Youth Board, but decided not to
run because a friend of his wanted the posi-
tion. JR. entered the Vice Presidential race
instead. “The next year he just destroyed the
president race,"temembers Leach, who served
as Treasurer of the Board during J.R.’s term as
Vice President. “He was just a role model to so
many people."

At Griuuell,J.R. continued to live commits
ted to his faith and kept in touch with his pas~
tor from Lincoln. “He didn't really talk about
his religion that much but it was obvious it
was a big part of his life," explained Schuna. “I
think it was obvious because he was so caring.
A lot of people are really caring, but with him,

there was an added tenderness."

Friends and family

Rivaling J.R.'s commitment to his faith
was his commitment to his family. Coming
with him on his two prospie trips, his family
continued to visit him after he began attends
ing Grinnell. schuna remembers that when-
ever his family would Visit, J.R. would take
them around and introduce them to all of his
friends.

His father, John, ms a prison guard, and

J.R. would joke about his father’s profession
frequently “Whenever anyone would tease
him, he would say things like, ‘My dad’s a pris»
on guard, and he will destroy you,"' rememr
bered Schuna.
_ When John visited for parents weekend
and went to the Dag Renaissance Fair, Leach
remembers, it took four Dag men and JR. to
get him into the stocks.

J.R. would also drive to Lincoln, Ill.
throughout the semester. Smith remembers
that the dedicated student even left once dur-
ing finals week when he was worried about his
grandmother.

At the same time, when he was at Grinnell,
his friends were like his family, and he treated
them with the same attachment. “He was very
committed and very devoted to his friends,"
said Masta.

His friends remember how he would show
his caring for them in random and everyday
ways. “JR. was just the nicest guy," said one
ﬂoormate, Madeline Lee '08. She remembers
how he would stop by her room many Limes a
day ”just to say ‘hi.’"

Schuna remembers one act ofkindness that
was especially random. JR. went to a “maker
youtrovlm-bear” store at a mall. He bought See
huna a stuffed Kung-Fu bear and presented it
to her when he returned. “I thought it was hid-
eous, and I never really liked it,” Schuua said,
“but now, I'm going to keep it forever.
