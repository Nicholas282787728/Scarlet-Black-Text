Brenda talked to an employee at
Computer Services and tound out
that the computer center could not
send the man a warning to leave
her alone unless she made a formal
case against him, even though, she
says, “apparently other instances

she had not saved any of the first.
more sexually threatening
messages, she decided not to take
official action. She expresses
frustration with the harassment
policy. “There is all this stuff you
have to go through. They can't
even send him a note about this or
let him know to stop it [unless she
presses iormal chargesl."

Although the person has not sent
Brenda any more messages. she
still worries about the incident.
“Whenever i see that name [on the
user listl. it jumps out." she says.
“More than anything, I want him
to know that it bothered me."

There are several steps involved
in iiling a sexual-harassment
,charge at Grinnel ranging [rom
informal consultation with the
dean 01‘ students or the associate
dean oi students to taking the com-
plaint before the Presidential
Hearing Board, After an incident is
taken before the Presidential
Hearing Board, a student can be
dismissed from the college, it it is
proven that harassing conduct did
take place. According to Tom
Cratiy, associate dean oi students,
“We see probably two or three
cases lot harassment] a year. Pros
bably one oi muse goes to the
presidential board."

Crady says that iniorming
students about the harassment
policy w' be stressed next year.
“It's cer inly an area'now that we
need to pay more attention to For
example, we’re including a session
on judicial procedures in the slur
dent staff workshop this fall that
will discuss sexual harassment.“

Crady, as well as the three
students interviewed. thinks that
part oi the problem arises when
studean don’t understand that
their behavior is harassing,
“They’re ipeople who harassi not
attuned to the‘relationship," he
says, “They think more is there
than is actually there." Brenda
thinks the person who sent her the
computer mail “probably thought
of it as some kind of a joke," and

the major subject oi discussion
on campus was resolved tonight,
though not without a iloor iight. At
first, Election Board wished to
keep numerical results oi the can-
didate elections secret, although it
would announce which candidates
had won or otherwise would be in a
runoii, and vote totals for the in-
itiatives. Joint Board, however,
overruled that decision by a wide
majority and voted to iorcc Elec-
tion Board to release the results. In
the presidential election, Greg
Evans, our current Parliamen-
tarian. got 522 votes to make him
the runaway winner. Pleshette
Hamb received 163 votes. Dave
Steinman 74, Brad Sheridan 24,
and Paul Froese 12 despite being
removed from the ballot. There
were a few other writerin votes. in-
cluding one for Hector. The vice

hand, has consistently inan-
dated a tougher policy toward
South Africa.

Mrlirnry, currently Univer»
sity Research Professor oiDiplo-

inncy and International Relu-
tions .t Georgetown University,
strongly criticized current “lip
service” adherence to the anti-
apartheid cause on both sides oi
the Atlantic.

lie accused nations, especially
the US. oi imposing sanctions
consistent with trade protection
attitudes. "You can disinvest
und still have considerable com-
mercial ties." he warned.

McHenry revealed additional
contradictions treating the sub-
ject oi sanctions. For example.
he sold that Europeans tradi-
tionally shy away horn the po~
litiesl use oi sanctions, and do
so now with regard to South
Airicn. Yet they have made
notable departures in situations
against Rhodesia, Iron. Libya.
and Syria.

The same holds tor the U.S.
“Americans argue that sanc-
tions don't work, yet use them
against Cuba. the Soviet Union.
Libya, lion ...und whoever else
we happen not to like." he said.

Though ndument .bout cit-
ing these hypocrisies, Mcery
cautioned against iocnsing too
much on snnetions. “In the U.s..
there‘s a tendency to oversim-
pliiy . . in feeling that it‘ you just
do THIS. it'll get done." But,
according to McHellly, other
factors are becoming “tore inl-
portnnt and “sanctions are be—
coming increasingly irrelevant.”

lie then stressed the recog-
nition that a “quick ﬁx“ to
the problem is highly unlikely.
“What is needed is a realis-
tir respprnisnl oi the situation,“
Mcl-‘lenry said.

He speculated that change
will involve a combination oi
iuctors, including time, edu-
cation, political pressure, eco—
nomic pressure, and even in—
creased violence. The latter
may be increasingly likely in the
light ol'recent restrictions placed
on anti-government groups in
South Africa.
