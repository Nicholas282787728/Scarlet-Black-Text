. Many Girls Earn
College Expenses

More than sixteen per cent of the
Grinnell cc-eds are earning either
part or all of their college expenses,
it was announced today by Anne E.
Smith, house director. Although
this per Cent is less than a third of
that of the men students, the num-
ber of girls who Work is larger this
year than ever before. of the
seventy who earn money while in
College, twentyvflve Wait on tables in
the women's dining room.

The jobs for which competition is
sharpest are those of telephone op-
erators in the College's private ex—
change, Seven girls are now ems
played at this switchboard

Several girls care for silverware
and glasses, and another is charged
with distributing the mail. Several
are laboratory assistants, while oth-
ers serve in tea rooms or do office
Work.

SIGMA DELTA CHI.

There will be a meeting of mem-
bers of Sigma Delta Chi tomorrow
noon in the Varsity tea room. Fur-
ther plans will be made for the Iowa
High School Press association con—
vention to be held here November 15
and 16.

College students are not afraid of
heavy rcading ig the circulation of
the Mable Anne Smith Memorial rent-
al collection is any norm. Accord-
ing to Miss Gretta Smith, librarian,
will Durant's “Mansions of Philoss
ophy" enjoys as great a popularity
as “All Quiet on the Western Front."

It has also been made evident that
college students are inclined to be
“scotch,” The thin books, which do
not afford the reader as many pages
for his money, do not have a wide
circulation. As a matter of fact,
Will Roger's best seller "Ether and
Me" reposed lonesomely on the shelf
for weeks before any one draw it
out, and even now it does not have
a wide circulation.

Students Like ‘Heavy’ Books, Statistics
on Rental Collection at Library Reveal

Essex,” “Henry the Eighth”, Seldes‘
“You Can’t Print That,” and “Mary
Queen of Scots” by Kurlballmrsier
bert are all popular. The best sell»
ore and buokrafrthermonth club
choices appeal to these who like to
“keep up" on the new ﬁction, Ruth
Suckow's "Cora," FowyS' “Wolf
Solent,” Glasgow's “They Stoop to
Folly,” and Walpole's “Hans Frost”
are among the most widely circulat-
ing books at the present moment.
Ernest Hemingway's “Farewell to
Arms”, another war story has just
been added to the collection.

The rental collection was begun
last spring, when a gift for the pur-
pose of $300 was made to the library
by Mrs J. H. Smith and Miss Gretta
Smith in memory of Miss Mable
An'ne Smith of the class of 1904.
Since that time the fund has been
used to buy books, starting with
ﬁfty volumes. The collection has
been added to, until now there are
about one ,hundred and twenty
volumes, for which approximately
3215 has been spent.

The rent on books which have cir-
culated has amounted to over $150,
but Miss’ Smith feels that by Christ»
mas it will have paid for itself.
However, many volumes have been
lost through the carelessness of stu-
dents, or have been carried from the
library without being checked out.
This makes it difficult to keep a
collection of this kind going, Miss
Smith pointed out, and the loss in-
curred through lost books prevents
more books from being purchased.
The endeavor is made ,to keep the
collection up to date, and also to buy
expensive non-ﬁction books of wide
interest.

Harriers Will

Meet Parsons

/
Large, Squad Will Compete

at Fairfield This
Week-end.

With strong hopes of keeping up
the winning streak that has followed
them so far this year, the undefeab
ed Pioneer cross country team will
journey to Fairfield this weekend to
meet the Parsons college runners.

Led by Captain Walter Secor, and
with victories over Coe and Penn al—
ready behind them, the local runners
will be out for more scalps.

A large squad of men will prob-
ably make the trip according to
Coach Carroll Swearingen, who has
picked the following men for the
meet: Capt. Secor, Mcllrath, Pye,
Mccandless, Murphy, McKenzie,
Winston Miller, and Art Hough. Par—
sons has no snap team and will give
the Pioneers a good battle.

When the State Teachers come
down next week, they will bring
their barriers with them. This meet
is expected to be the hardest of the
year as the Cedar Falls team won
over the local team last year. A
tentative meet with Carleton college
when they play the Pioneer gridders
here will probably close the season.

Intra—mural Meet
November 14

Intrdrmural cross-country will be
given a chance to show their metal
for their respective halls when the
annual intra-mural meet takes place
on November 14. A fairly large
group of men are practicing daily for
this event as well as the individual
meet which precedes the ‘other by
two days.

The individual meet will be held on
November 12, and is open to any
man in school. This most usually
brings out one or two good athletes
who may be prospects for the varsity
team. Medals will be awarded to
the first and second place winners in
this meet,

The lntra~mural runners are sup-
posed to work out for three weeks,
so that anyone not already reporting
should see Coach Swearingen at
once. Eligibility rules for this meet
are the same as those of all other
intra-mlll‘al contests.

Y. M. C. A. To Meet
The YMCA. will hold its next
meeting tomorrow evening at seven
o'clock in the association building.
A talk will be given by Rev. W. C.

erican Board of Missions.

v. M, Y. W. and'drinnellincmna
Will Benefit from Pioneer

Chest Funds.

Beginning with an address in
chapel tomorrow morning by the
Rev. W. C. Fairfield, Home secre-
tary of the American Board of Mis—
sions. the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C.
A. will launch their annual Pioneer
Chest drive once more. For three
days—Thursday, Friday and Satur-
dayian intensive personal solicits—
tion of student support will be made,
in an effort to raise the two thous-
and dollar budget which is the aim of
the drive.

The campaign has been planned
and will be directed by a joint com-
mittee composed of two Y. M. C. A.
cabinet members, Lewis Troyer and
Walter Secor; two representatives of
the Y.W.C.A., Blanche Hulsebus and
Elizabeth Cook; and Mr. Nelson w.
Wehrhan, who heads the Crinnell—in—
China committee. Solicitation of the
students will be carried out by the
two “Y” cabinets.

The extensive service which both
the Y. W. and Y. M. have rendered
the college in the past as well as
their broadened acti ties for the re~
mainder of the year necessitate the
successful completion of this budget,
the committees point out.

Fairfield Is Mission Worker

Mr. Fairfield, the chapel speaker
tomorrow, is well—ﬁtted to speak on
the subject of GrinnellriD-China,
which will be the main
theme of his talk, as he served for
several years on the mission fields of
China. His talk will also concern
itself with the important service
rendered on the campus by the two

Y. M. C. A. Sponsors Annual ,
Activities of Uncle Sam’s Club

Once each year, just before Christ-

mas men at the dormitories return
home just before dinner to find the
,clubrooms filled with a somewhat
ragged, but enthusiastic group of
boys from the south side of Crinnell,
who have come up to the college for
their annual Christmas party. The
exceedingly noisy and hungry youths
are none other than Uncle‘ Sam's
club "in action."
, Their annual dinner is but one of
the things done for them each year
by the Y. M. C. A., which takes an
active interest in directing the year-
round activities of the club, and
which devotes part of the funds se~
cured through the Pioneer chest to
this project. .

Just what is the Uncle Sam’s
Club? It is an organization started
twenty-nine years ago by a few Grins
nell men for the use of boys and
girls of the south side, to bring them
facilities for recreation and follow-
ship which the limited circumstances
of most of their homes denied them.

 

 

and to develop their bodies and char-
acters, recognizing them as potential
citizens of the community

Grlnnell college has figured prom-
inently in this organization through
the years of its existence, providing
leadership, financial backing, enter-
tainment and aiding the city in en—
deavoring to reduce conditions of
poverty on the south side.

Today the Uncle Sam’s Club con-
tains fifty members, and its work
is largely carried on by the Y. M. C.
A. Each week on one or two nights
a college man opens the club house
and directs the evening's nctlvl res.
included in them are sports, discus-
sions, project work, nature study and
emphasis on clean living. Each
Saturday morning the boys enjoy a
swim in the college pool.

Hikes, weiner roasts and the an-
nual college Christmas party round
out a program of work for the Y. M,
C. A. which has been recognizcd by
citizens of Crinnell as a really cre-
ative project.

Continuing to hold a place side by
side with Drake in the Missouri
Valley title race, the Pioneers are
being allowed a three day rest and
one big breaking-training dinner this
week by Coach Watt before he
starts the men on the grind for the
last part of the season.

But for four fumbles which were
recovered by Drake, the Pioneers
might today be well on their way to-
ward the Valley crown. The men-
tors do not expect too much, how-
ever, and are well satisfied with the
work of the men in battling Drake
to a s to a tie last Saturday night.
The game was played under the
lights before a crowd of 15,000 per-
sons and was a thriller from start
to ﬁnish.

Both teams threatened often but
failed-in the pinches, each crossing
the goal line once. ‘T‘he Bulldog
counter came in thesecond quarter
when Van Koten plunged over from
the live—yard line. The try for point
after touchdown failed.

Pioneers Plunge Over

Early in the fourth period Drake
pounded its way to the Grinnell
three-yard marker, only to be turned
back by a penalty and some stellar
defensive work. Taking the ball from
the 15»yard line, the Pioneers, [with
Ruff and Rose cracking the line re—
gularly, carried the ball to the Bull-
dog 25ryard mark. Ruff took it to

off right tackle and on the identical
play, repeated for 19 yards and the
score. His kick, failed.

Not to be stopped so easily, Grin-
nell took the ball in midﬁeld) again
and hammered away to the five-yard
mark with four downs to make a
score. With two to go the ball was
on the sneinch line and Rose's tum»
ble was recovered by Drake to pull
them out of a bad hole. The Bull-
dogs tried desperately to score by a
fast passing attack but this failed.

Drake Has Passing Attack

One of the big Pioneer thrills of
the game came directly following
the Drake touchdown when Bose re-
turned the kickotf to midneld and
Thomas went to the 15-yard line on
the next play. They failed to keep
up the work, however.

Drake pulled the surprise for the
fans with a good passing attack,
Bulldogs being o_n hand at every
play, whereas the Grinnell aerial of-
fense refused to' function at all,
