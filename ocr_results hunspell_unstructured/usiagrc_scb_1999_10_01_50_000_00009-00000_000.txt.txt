Grinnellian of
the Week

By‘ Sarah J. Liebman
Staff Writer

Jonathan Brand suggested that as
“Grinnellian of the Week” he wear a
party hat or maybe a lizard Suitr He
ﬁnally settled on a red and black Miss-
Anietica»sryie sash that would read
“Grinnellian ofthe Week."

Known by his tutorial students for
his charisma,
sense of humor,
and laid»back
style, Brand serves
as Secretary to the
College and Spee
cial Assistant to
President Osgood.

As Secretary of the
College he serves
as an cit-campus
resource for the
Board ofTrustees,

This semester
he and Osgood
are teaching a tu-
torial on the sub-
ject of the rela»
tionship between
law and society.

“I'm enjoying it

immensely,” he said. Even more than
he enjoys teaching with Osgood, “I
love to teach. I’m thrilled to be teach-
ing. I’m a freak about teaching. It helps
me plug into the common goal ofthis
college, teaching students. Teaching
makes me a more effeetive Special ASA
sistant and Secretary of the College.”
It gives him a chance to interact with
students and he can better understand
faculty members/1t helps me become
a part ofGrinnell College,” he said. >

He is pleased with his experiences
with the students in his [UIOIiAL “Stu—
dents talk at 8:15 . r . Iris averylively
class and I’m very impressed with the
students." He enjoys teaching under—

graduates and has found it very simi- '

lat to teaching at the graduate level, but
“maybe that is a testament to Grinnell
students,” he said.

In his office are many books in
French, English, and Legaiese. on his
bookshelf rests a faded jean jacket. A
black teapot sits on his desk. There is a
Sunday New York Times on the ﬂoon

Born in New Jersey, Brand moved
to St. Louis where he attended high
school. He graduated with a BA. from

rn

the University of \Visconsin-Madison,
and an MA. in French Literature from
University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.
He taught French at University of Cali-
forniaeRiverside for several years be-
fore he decided to go to Cornell Law
School where he himselfhad Osgood
for Legal Philosophy He enjoyed the
class and asked to be Osgood’s research
assistant during
the summer.
After practio
ing law for a year
in northern
California he re-
turned to
Cornell as a
member of the
facultyservingas
Associate Direc-
tor of Legal
Writing. He
helped students
with learning
disabilities. He
came to Gtinnell
, with Os
A ‘ “and no
Grinn'ellian,
said. Before he'came to Grinnelll,‘h
didn’t know the college’s history; bu
now is glad to be part of it. ' _

When asked about his family,
Brand chants, “Lions and tigers and
bears, oh my! Lions and tigers and
bears, oh my!" (His four»year»old
daughter is in a Wizard of Oz phase)
He also has a wife, a L'wo-year—old son,
and a dog. He feels that his family is
doingwell in Iowa. They loved the fine
arts opening and the Lincoln Center
jazz concert. '

Whenever his family considers a
vacation, he always 'wants to go to
Paris, It is “embedded in my psyche
from my junior semester abroad {in
Paris while studying at Madison],
which was so inﬂuential. That part of
me is always there.” He loves French
theatre, the ethos of Paris, the culture
in general. France is a small country
that that he feels has everything.

But even after living in California

. and Paris, Brand loves Iowa. He even

likes the town. “I am more in-tune
with nature here. I tun, and [running]
keeps you more in touch with your
self [it is calming] to see what is hap-
pening around you." -
