SCHOLASTIC FAIR PLAY

Most Grinnell students entel ain a positive
abhorrence for anything that resembles poor
sportsmanship and dirty playing in athletic
contests, They are equally resentful and an-
gered at forms of dishonesty in business and
social dealings. Yet, all of us are consistent-
ly denying ourselves the opportunity of
participating ill another sport, the sport of
good clean scholastic competition, by tolere
atillg the evil of the ”chisler” in examina-
tions.

To many, the thought of going into an

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

examination with only one’s brains to rely
upon has become a habit; while to others,
alld a comparitively few, a crib is used to
supplant the grey matter. Chances are that
the latter group will never be punished
either by professors or by their conscience.
The only punishment that is dealt out is to
the great majority of honest students.

Attempts have been made ill the past to
solve the problem of campus honesty, but
the efforts have‘ been effectively throttled
by student apathy. Tomorrow, a question-
naire polling student opinion on cribbing
and dishonesty in examinations will be dis-
tributed at house meetings. For once, give
the matter seﬁous consideration; give your
honest opinion and help create fair-play in
Grinnell’s classrooms.

IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE!

Hall elections have come and gone. Soon
the new officers will formally take over the
administration of their respective halls.
These new men have been greatly honor d.
They have before them a real opportunity
and a real responsibility.

In order to have the house council system
of student government work well enough
to justify its existence, each officer must
carry out the duties that go with his posi-
tion, Most officers have honestly made such
an attempt in the past. Last year, however,
the weakest point of this whole system of
democratic student government was the
manifest inability of the provosts to en-
force quiet hours. This year, the office of
provost has been done away with, and the
duty of enforcing the hall rules has fallen
upon the vice-presidents. These lnell, Wil-
liam Paringer of Smith, Robert Dorathy of
Langan, James Gruenwald of Rawson, Ro-
bert Whitley of Gates, Robert Hohson of
Clark and Dave Miller of Dibble, have an
opportunity to prove that student govern—
ment can be efficientithat quiet hours can
be enforced The success or failure of these
six men, more than anything else, is the
real measure of the success or failure of our
democratic hall government.

 

News Views

Should Congress
Give Refugees
A U. S. Home?

——By W.C.H.—

According to weekend press re-
ports, that premier bulwark of
Americanism, the American Le-
gion, has again discovered an op—
portunity of defending our demo-
Cl'acy, this time against the
threatened invasion of our shores
by 20,000 refugee Children during
the next two years.

Speaking at a committee

heuriug on a hill proposing to
find homes in this country for
20,000 homeless refugee chil—
dren during 1939 and 1940,
John Tltonms Taylor, Legion
spokesman, declared that the
veteran's group favored stop~
ing an immigration for the
next 10 years ﬁnd that if the
proposal were “considered seri-
ously" Congre-s “might as well
consider letting in 20,009 Chill—
cse children."
"Allie‘d'with Mr.‘ TayloTin his
heroic stand against this news
found threat to Americanism was
Francis H. Kinnlcutt of New
York, speaking for 30 allied pa-
triotic societies, and Mrs. Agnes
Waters, mouthpiece of the widows
of World War vetEI'al-ls. It was
Mrs. Watel‘s’ belief that these
children would be welcomed into
Communist homes to add to the
“seven million persons who are
now boring from within.”

Just where the bill under (Ils-
cussion offers hiding places for
a horde of Immb-thro ‘illg Com-
munists is hind to discover. As
it stands, the measure merely

 

extends our immigration quota.
to allow 20,000 or the 75,000
homeless children of Europe To
enter the United states upon
the finding of private homes
willing to care for them in this
country. supported by persons
of such tvidely varying laws
and positions as Governor Leh-
man of New York, Dr. Barry
Emerson Fosdicli, Helen Hnycs,
William Allen “’hite, Cardinal
Mmldeleiu of Chicago, Dorothy
Thompson, rrcstdent Hutchins
of Chicago university and Her—
bert Hoover, the measure would
hardly seem to be one to throw
our super-patriots into n dither.

But into n dither they’ve gone,
seeing Communists and Chinese
threatening to take the country
by storm. Chasing Communists
has long been a favorite sport of
the Legion and its kindred organi—
zations, and llltra-Americanism
has lollg been their car inal doc-
trine. But where our professional
flag—wavers find their red lncn
ate in hewildcrcd, helpless chil-
dren and how they justify their
advocacy of slamming the door in
these children’s races With their
professed belief in the great
American virtues of democracy,
luunanitcrianlsm, and tolerance is
frankly beyond our Comprehen-
Slon.

DORIC

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

By John Marion—’—

Comes time when we write our
last Doric column and hand the
brightly burning torch to our slic-
cesscr, We feel that the torch is
burning as brightly, if not bright-
01', than when we accepted it and
hope that our successor, whoever
he or site may he, does not has
come as cordially hated as we
were.

Enter the Doric contest early and
avoid the rush. There is no quick-
er or better way in the world to
lose your friends (7) than to
write Doxlc, which we, to our
great dismay, learned early.

in writing this we learned much
about human nature and about scv—
erol people on the campus who
CANNOT “TAKE 'ir” Some of
these are supposed big shots and
we think that a final_ expose
would be appropriate so that we
will have their hatred for the re-
maiudcr of the year. We also
learned who can take it, So we'll
compliment them and separate the
sheep from tho. goats.
