Bob couldn't have wished for a better memorial. Nor could the students

even the loudest campus cynics.

inherently sacred to students. Building and Grounds hasactually managed to

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Farewell S and B?

As of the April 10 deadline, the
StudentPublicationsandRadioCom-
mittcc (SPARC), responsible for ad-
ministering the campus media, had
not received a single application for
nextycar‘sScarletandBlackEditorr
in-Chief position. As do all college
newspapers, the S 11MB provides an
invaluable service to this campus. It
is also the most readily available
sourceofpracticaliournalism experi-
ence for interested Grinnell students.
Unfortunately, we all often fail to
recognize these facts.

Admittedly thequalityofthc news-
papcrisnotwhatiiusedtobe,butthat
is not the faultofthcnewspupcritself
and should not be held against the

vpapcror futurcstaffs. Only thrccshort

semesters ago the S and B was hon-
ored by theCqumbiaSchelasticPress
Association. That high level ofqual-
ity can easily be achieved again if
something is done.

I maintain that the generous donar
tion of equipment and funds by the
administration last year to further the
S midi? cause did notaddress the real
problem: lack of interest in joining
the staff. Yes, the new equipment has
eased production pressures, but there
still is very little incentive to volunr
teerfor Ihenewspaperstaff. Although

staff-members are paid, their sala~
ries, when averaged ovcra semester’s
worth of Work, fall far below the
minimum wage; therefore, it is obvir
ous that they have essentially volunr
teered for the position in their quest

for this semester had only one appli~

There simply needs to be greater
incentive! Without it, qualified anti
caring students will not continue to
step forward to take the challenge.
The most obvious and widely used of
incentives is academic credit. De-
spite much resistance to this idea by
Grinncll faculty, staff and ﬂdminiSr

only way. Athletes getcredit forthcir

that the S and B provides not to men-

similar manner. Journalism is a le-

To the editor.

On August 21, 1990, a news re-
lease wentoutfrom Grinnell College
and was picked up by 416 newspar
pcrs in 32 states, with a readership of
more than two million. Itproclaimed
that Grinnclt was going to “make a
lasting and valuable environmental
change . . . bold enough to be worth—
,while.” Dining Schiccs, under the

directionothiveMcConnellandwith

help from tho Envrronincntal Interest
Group, put into action a plan to rcr
ducc waste by implementing the use
of “permenantware.” Less than two
years later, 1,300 forum mugs have
been stolen, forcing Dining Services
to rethink their belief that we are a
group of responsible citizens, genu—
inely concerned about our environ-
ment.

The disappearance of the mugs
forces the resurgence of thatevil en-
vironmental enemy: styrofoam cups.

To the Editor,

I am writing to correct an lnacCuV
racy in Josh Ford’s front page article
which appeared in the April 10,1992
edition of the Scarlet and Black
("Grinellians part of prorchoice
march"). With the same level of po-
litical knowledge he so frequently
displays in his opinion columns, Mr.
Ford incorrectly characterized theRoe
v. Wade decision as making first [fie
mcstcr abortions pan of a woman’s
right to privacy. In fact, Rocv. Wade
legalized abortion in all three trimes-
ters. Additionally, Mr. Ford states
“Jen Kern, one of the organizers of
the Grinnelt contigent, expressed that
there was a certain sense of ‘iinmi-
nent doom’ that distinguished this
most recent march from the last one
in 1990. which came on the heels of
tlic ‘Webstcr v. chroductivc Health

 

Services,’[sic] and gave states the

Josh Ford is actually an advertise

“public service annoucements".

Day of Silence becomes noisy

The “Day of Silence” was a chr
mendous show of solidarity for the
gay/bi/lesbiancommunityatGrinneil.
For those who managed to remain
truly silent,lhavetheuttnostrospect.
Your commitment is admirable.

As I understand it, however, the
purpose of holding a “Day of Si-
lenec" is twofold: l) to show solidar-
ity and 2) to demonstrate and experi-
ence the feeling of total isolation of
being silent —— the feeling of being
overlooked, unrecognized and incom-
plete. The purpose, then, is mani-
festly not to make oneself more con

spicuous than usual in that silence.

Exaggerated pantomime scenes,
writing notes to be read aloud by
others anti writing messages on the
board in classrooms are, to say the
least, conspicuous displays. Most
Grinnellstudentsprobablywitnessed
thesedisplaysaroundcampusatleast
once on the sorcalled “Day of Si-
lencc,"

Not only are these activities in»
consistentwiththepurposcofa‘Day
ofSilence," but they are also disrup-
tive to the teaming environment in
the classroom. It is well with ll'ldir

viduuls’ rights to participate in mak-
ing this statement, but it is not their
right to makearnockcry ofthe educa-
tion for which we htiveall paid a large
sum, It IS my right to be free from
unreasonable, unproductive disrup-
tion in the Classroom.

Those of you who, even without
speaking, created or particrpatcd in
conspicuous scenes were not truly
silent. You made your serious state-
mcntintoatrivialgameand managed
to irritate at least one person who is
otherwise sympathetic to your cause.
