Greet Player
First to Act
as ‘Peer Gynt’

Russell Thorndike
Medallion, Tin-Type
of Elder Keen

By FRANCES RAE

,Although “Hamlet" is generally
considered one of the greatest of all
roles, Russell Thorndike, who played
the part in the Ben Greet Players'
presentation of “Hamlet" in the Grinr
nell high school auditorium. Satur-
day night, confessed that “Peer
Gynt,” rather than "Hamlet," is his
favorite role.

He was the first to play the part
of “Peer Gynt" in Ibscn's play by that
name. Seventy-five Norwegians came
to London for 'the first performance,
among them a man who was a per—
sonal 'friend of both Ibsen and Grieg. ,
This man presented Mr. Thorndike‘
with a copy of part of the musical
score in Grelg‘s own writing, togeth-
er with a first copy of the play in
Norwegian. This had been presented.
to him by Ibsen.

Has Richard in costume l

Mr. Thorndike also possesses a real
Elizabethan costume like the one
worn in Shakespeare's production of
"Richard III." It was worn by the
elder Keen when he played “Rich-l

era In” at the Drury Lane theater
in London, 126 years ago. |

The most valuable of Mr. Thorn
dike’s possessions is the medallion

that he wears when playing “Ham—
let. n It is a ﬁn-type of the elder
Keen set in a frame of white stones
and hung on a heavy gold chain. The
tradition is that this chain belonged.
to Shakespeare, and that the menial-l
lion, although its original owner is
unknown, is over two centuries old.
nearing Famous as Child

It has been handed down for cen-
‘turies hy leading Shakespearean acu

tors. Ellen Terry presented it to Mr.
Thorndike. In the last two centur—
ies, the two Keeps, the two Irvings,
Edwin Booth, Ellen Terry, and noW‘
Mr. Thorndike have been its posses
sore.

Peter Dearing, who played the
"ambassador" and the “braggart
gentleman” in “Hamlet," and ”rab-
ian" in "Twelfth Night,” is only 17
years old, and once was known as
“the Jackie Coogan of England.”

Knows Four Plitys ,

'Sir Philip Ben Greet became inter—
ested in him because at 11 years of
'age Mr. Dearing could repeat two
Shakespearean plays in their entire»,
ty. The youth knows and can take
any one part in all four of the plays
"Twelzth Night," “Hamlet," “Mac—
'beth," and "As You Like It." Sir
Philip hopes to train him to carry on
his work,

Enid Clark,who played “Ofelia" in
“Hamlet,” confided that she had been
playing Shakespearean roles since
she was 11.

Editor
The Scarlet and Black

Grinnell. Iowa

Dear Sir:

The all-college assembly a week
ago Monday was the nearest approach
to a free interchange of opinions be-
tween undergraduates and faculty
members that has taken place at
Grinnell within my memory. Such ef-
iairs ought to become so frequent
and so well established that it would
be the natural ﬁling far eitber stu-
dents or professors to discuss freely
any point which arises in their re-
Istionship.

Hitherto about the only way for
students to get their ideas across to
the faculty has been by petition,
probably the least intelligent and
least satisfactory of all forensic imr
plemenlts. On the other hand, the
ideas of the faculty are chiefly im—
posed by ukase, and their decisions
are accomplished facts, in whose
making undergraduates are rarely
called in for consultation.

Without imparing the soverignty
of either body in its own domain,
there is a large area of common inter-
sts, common problems, and questions
which cannot be settled by one with
out consideration of the other. and
in this area there is plenty of room
ior all the elements of the campus
to get together.

We are engaged in a common pur-
suit, the pursuit of knowledge. Some
of lls follow it, it is ltrue. at a. con-
siderable distance, but we are all try»
ing to travel in the same general di-
rection. It seems reasonable to say
that lthis journey or four years {:04
gether could be made much happier
for all concerned, and more success
ful, if it were quite frankly acknoWr
ledged that Where there is .m) (:0-
operation there is no authority.

We have been fortunate at Grinnell
in the attitude of mutual tolerance.
which has existed for years between
faculty and Student bodies. Mutual tol-
erance. however, isaneutral and real»
ly a ridiculous virtue. It ought to be
left behind, and be replaced by the
active virtue of mutual conﬁdence.
Nothing creates conﬁdence like get
ting the other fellow’s point of view.

This second assembly, brief and in~

Tumbling Improves
Dancing of Coeds

trontlnued frnm Pale U

Tumbling is rapidly becoming rec-
ognizcd throughout the colleges of
the country as one of the most benc-
ficial of sports for women, and its
popularity is growing.

Muscle Coordination

“This is 50," Miss Crosby says, “be-
cause you do not have to be an ath-
lete to take part in it, The old comr
pete against the young, the weak
beat the strong, and the fats and
leans, longs and shorts are put on an
equal basis. Furthermore, tumbling
does not require elaborate equip
ment. It can be done in the parlor,
kitchen, or barn at any time.

“Tumbling is valuable," she
tinucd, “because it produces all-
around development of the body.
bringing out muscle coordination
and supplencss rather than strength.
It develops good posture and grace
of movement, and its claims for
dancing are not just statements. It
produces skill in control of the body,
and is often used by dancing masters
to aid in bringing about the dancer's
perfect development,"
