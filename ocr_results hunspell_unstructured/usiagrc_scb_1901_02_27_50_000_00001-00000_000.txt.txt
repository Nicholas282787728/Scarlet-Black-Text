What to ExpECt From the Glee
Club and Orchestra.

The people of Grinnell and vi-
cinity are looking forward with
great interest to the seventh an-
nual home concert which will be
given in the Congregational
church Friday evening, March 8.
An elaborate program has been
prepared, and an evening of -pure
enjoyment is in store for all who
attend.

The Amphinn Orchestra is bet
ter than ever before,and this is says
ing a great deal when its unusually
successful appearance last year is
considered. The membership of
the organization numbers twenty
ﬁve and the difﬁcultgrade of music
now in use has never before been
attempted.

The Glee Club,of twenty voices,
is rapidly rounding into its old
time form; it will also be prepared
to administer the usual dose of
local hits. One of the features of
the program is an alumni song
written by Mr. Otis and set to
music by Prof. Olds,

The distinctively new feature of
this year’s entertainment will be
the appearance of the Euterpe
Club. These twentyrﬁve young
ladies are to furnish two of the
numbers on the regular program.
Although this organization has no
successful past to look back upon,
nevertheless it is sate to predict
that the results of Mrs. Cole's uric
tiring efforts in behalf of the Club
will be realized In a most success-
ful initial appearance.

Thus the interests of these sevc
enty people are directly centered
in providing a proﬁtable and en-
joyable entertainment for the peo
ple of Grinnell. It is to be the
social as well as the musical event
of the season and no one can afc
ford to miss it. The proceeds of
the concert are to be devoted to
the reserve fund of the May Fesc
tival.

position. On the left, in the ﬁrst
structure was given opportunity
to show skill as a marksman.

The Art Gallery displayed
beautiful and numerous paint-
ings and pieces ot sculpture by
ancient and modern artists. The
diligence and care shown by the
collectors in procuring such a
variety of choice subjects and the
ingenuity displayedin arranging
and systematically naming each,
caused much merrimentr The
wild man from Borneo, Madame
Nation. the talkative wolf, the fat
lady and the trick elephant were
\VOltll going miles to see. nor
should one have missed the tent
of mythological beauties portrays
ed with such excellence. The
Chinese booth was exquisite and
most restful whereihe tired sights
seer might be refreshed with the
magic potion. The hypnotist's
show called forth much comment,
so astounding were the feats per»
formed; and the gypsy fortune
teller had her share of patronage.

After the company had satisﬁed
its desire for the wonderful, the
lights were extinguished as a sig-
nal for opening the restaurant
where were revealed three long
tables tastefully decorated with
Carnations, daffodils and Smilax,
and lighted with candelabra. A
course luncheon tor so large a
company, though not often at
tempted at class ahairs, was serve
ed in a most creditable manner
and was greatly relished by the
hungry visitors ot the Exposition.

The entire effect of the grounds
was admirable with its oriental
hangings, blazing posters, circur
lar settoes piled with pillows, and
touches of class color thoughtful-

State Oratorical Association
Matters.

Grinnell will be represented by
two delegates tothe State Orator-
ical Association this year. They
are, J. c. Gleysteen and T. Risser;
W. L. Brown, the third delegate,
being detained at home by sick-
ness. The contest is held at Mt.
Pleasant today and tomorrow. Ale
though Grinnell is not represented
on the program this year, her in»
terest in the meeting is just as vi-
tal as if she were, for there is no
reason why she should not have a
contestant next year. A move-
ment by some of the colleges is on
foot to shorten the sessions ofthe
association. At a meeting held
Tuesday afternoon the local
league instructed its delegates to
oppose any change in the length
ot the meetings, deeming the bus-

 

iness to be transacted ol sufﬁcient
importance to warrant a two days’
session.

The Chicago Alumni banquet
A Success.

The Alumni Banquet and Re
union of February 22,rgor,iswithe
out doubt, the most successful
and enthusiastic of any thus far ’
held in the history ofthat organi-
zation, After a short reception
in the parlors of the Victoria, the
members sat down tothe banquet
at aboutscven o'clock. It is pleas~
ant to remark that, while none of
the after dinner speeches were ap
parently written and seemed to
be spoken off-hand, they were all
carefully thought out and for that
reason enjoyable. About ﬁfty
were present; no gloom or doubt
was at any time expressed as to
the future or Iowa college, but
only c1:thu=l;smairtl a feeling that
things are moving along the track.

ent in the press of Breitkupf&

In this connection it might be'
interesting to know that the song

“Aufwiedersehn,” written by Miss

appeared as a poem in the Unit
and which was set to music by
Prof. Cole, has been, during the
past year, one ot the best selling
