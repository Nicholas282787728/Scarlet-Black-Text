“ill Wire Flurlll Glﬂs.

The proceeds from ”Fashion," the
faculty ploy to be presented at 'Lh‘e
Colonial theater next Thrrrsday night,
will be for the benefit of the Faculty
club and the college endowment fund.
Seats will go on sale at Talbotts
drug store Monday after-noon. hlost
of the seats will be priced at 1.00,
some at $1.50, a few at 5.75, and all
those in the gallery unreserved at 3.50.

Mr. Beale, who will occupy the low-
-r right box at the performance has
been delegated to receive all floral of.
erings that are to he handed across
be footllghts to the actresses.

Orchestra To Accompany

A nine or ten piece orchestra under
he direction of Mr. Pierce has been
ecured to furnish the music for the
'vening, which will include accompan-
ment for the incidental songs.

Three out of five of the songs come
a one scene, the so—ealled conserva-
ory scene. Colonel Howard, (Mr.

rdlay), enters and sees’the gentle
ertrude, (Miss Lay), busy arranging
lowers, whereupon he greets her with
‘Believe Me If All Those Endenring
r oung Charms." After a time he gets

o the point of making a proposal but

ertrude hurries him out. AS soon as

e is gone she reflects thus upon the
rnture of man and love: “TWIN. a
.trange being is man! why should he
resitate to say~nay. why should I
rrevent his saying what I would most
elight to bear?” Then she begins to
lug, "Call Me Pet Names Dearest, Call
ie a Bird."

Mr. Boom Slugs

Later the honest farmer, (Mr.
.eeml, is so touched over hearing

bout the parents of the orphaned
ertrude that he is moved to sing,
Be Kind To The Old Folks At

Dine.”

In the counting house scene the

Expense Is Span-ed

Because the play is being put on as

benefit, expense has been spared

herever possible, and the difficulty

f presenting it in the manner of the
rme it was first played has necessarily

cen increased. In spite of this, and
f the fact that it is not easy to dis-
over costumes of the year 1845 in a
own settled in 1854, costumes that
re absolutely authentic have been
Ecured, The success is due in large

easure to the efficiency of Miss

rwden and her committee composed

f Mrs. Spencer, Mrs. Steiner, and
Ilss Dorothy Dewitt.

The task of selecting appropriate
feces from the great many possible

rnishings that were offered, has been

ell executed by Mrs. Nollen, repre-
entative of the Faculty, and Doro‘lhy

-ilte, representative of the production
lasses.

“PASl FﬂHMS BASE [If
lUlUHE”, SAYS SlEINEH

Gilllllell Sill‘iOlOgisl.

"The past forms the base for the lu~
turc and if you kill the past you kill
your future because the past becomes
part of you,” s: 'd Dr. Steiner in hrs
talk at the rut scuror chapel of the
year, Friday morning.

“Marching youth brings a lurup up
into my llll'ozlt,” said Dr. Steiner as
he bade the class not to forgot the past
lest they be dead to the future. Dr.
Steiner slated that the class prophecy,
written in jest, was ruost often found
to be right because it was based on
history. “The old prophecies were ill!
based on the history of the past.

Our l’ust Iriles

“Every minute we have lost and ev-
ery deed we have left unrlone. lives.
If you kill the past, you are killlug the
family skeleton in the closet. Your
deeds which are killed stick to you like
a Siamese twin; nothing dies, cvc
'tlllug is in you written rn rings w ich
cirelo you and, llkc the rings in a tree,
tell of the years of your file. Make the
beginurng of immortality.

“Every civilization rests itself an
the doings of the past. The past, if
alive in you, gives you wings but if
dead puts'you in chains. You can’t
escape the past. In the noontirue 01
your life the shadows are under your
fcet, tomorrow the shadows will grow,

)rust Make h‘l -ud

“You can stay alive only a‘
make the past your friend. If we shut
our lives to the past wc are dead.
Your life has its beginnings in God and
if you hve in the future and leave the
past you are dead. If you had a “hell"
of a good time in college you will have
a ‘llell' of a time in life. You can make
grades this way but not clim‘ncter.\1
pity those who have marked time since
they were sophomores and like a
drummer beat time while others
passed on. 'Whatsocvcr a man sowcth
that shall he reap}

'4 ‘Relnembel' now (by creator in thy
youth; fear God and keep the com-
mandments, for this is the beauty of
man," quoted Dr. Steiner in closing.
