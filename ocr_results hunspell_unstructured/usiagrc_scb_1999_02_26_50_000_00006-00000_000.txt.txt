Belts also expressed uncertainty
about whether the change in alcohol

to do with other campus alcohol poli-

In fact, the reason there was no keg
at last Saturday's Gardner concert was
that the contract procuring the lounge

pired. Alcohol was on hold last week
until the Committee on student Life
(CSL) could establish a new contract.

to uphold last year’s alcohol policy, and

Not all students agreed. Garrett
Shelton ’01 attached an email to Ford's
email to express his own views on the
issue. Shelton wrote, “Painting the ad-
ministration as an oppressive institu.
tion isn't going to get anyone any
where. It’s a bullsit habit that seems
to be pretty common on this campus.
Tom Crady is a nicc guy. ., However.
he is..,underan enormous amountof
pressure because of the liability in-
volvcd with drinking and, obviously,
drugs.”

Crady said, “I’m always very con.
cerned about alcohol and drugs. I
don’t know a dcan who isn't, particu-
larlywtth the number ofalcohol deaths
lnarionally]."

Also, even though binge drinking
at Grinnell is below the national aver—
age, crady said he was especially con-
ecrncd In this respect. Thc surveys,
said Crady, would help monitor such
activities as binge drinking.

Amy Eilctt, the Community ser.
vice Coordinator, said, “I see my col»
leagues trying to gather good informa.
tron, and to make good decisions
about students, and it's interesting to
hear students interpret that as
threatening....Hnw do you get the
information to b‘cgin to keep people
from drinking?"

Eilett also said that the prcscnI al.

He mentioned how violence i

He said we're open enough about

He described how our'cullurc in.

But, he added, a lot of people are
”screwed up" by this guilt. “We're in

Agin, he emphasized that conflict

“Rape and sexual assault are not only
physical violence but also psychologi-

cal violence," he said, “where you don’t

get to choose what you do with your
own body."

He also described how many
people get into a state ofunconscious-
ness from alcohol and other drugs,
which “are almost always involved in
creating the statistics on disease, preg-
nancy and force.”

Just mat rape and sexual assault are
happening creates an environment
that we all have to live in and affects
us all, he commented.

“It's hard for allofus to get to date

be bold accounIablc and responsiblc
for our own individual actions, and we
must respect tho other person and his

He also talked about the more
positivc and satisfying aspects of out
sex “drive," but also the fact that its
“selﬁsh," and “insatiable," which can
get us into problems. “I recommend
consideration of the othcr before the
self, but rial instead ofme self.” he said.
“I insist on the boundary because I
can't gtvt myself away."

To be safe, he emphasized, we must

strong correlation between self-esteem
and Victimization,” he said. “we do

“The bottom line, on every level
ofhuman interaction, is that force is
xrnv acceptable and communication
is alwayr respectable," hc affirmed

Last night. Professor Sylvia
Thoraomsmith, Sophia Dobson ’98,
Larma and schaalman presented
“strong Women: A. Different Ap.
preach to Rape Education,"

Latina described how the videos

they showed last night started out as a
project for Gender and women's stud.
ies in one ofThotson»Smith's classes,
as a progressive education tool to pre-
vent tape and sexual assault. ”It is also
a tool uscd to make tape less sexy, as
many education tools still plaec
women in the role as victims and do
nothing to counter the vulgarity ofthe
sexual assault itself," he described.

“The approach is that women are
able and capable ofproteeting [heme
selves, to empower women, and to give
men a second glance at women as
strongindividuals," hesaid. They also
shared discussions they had while
making the video, including their
complaints and “pearls ofwisdom."

“Sylvia is a wonderful professor,
very active, and she still made the time
to speakfor us. Sophia(Dobson) and
Jo (Schaalman) are also more than
qualified to help out,” Larmr com-
menrcd. “i can't give them enough
credit.”

Match 9 and II, SAWG is giving
a study break to perform scripts by
Slant, Started by college students in
Virginia. The study break will be in
Younket lounge onTuesday, and Loose
Lounge on Thursday.

Slant presents monologues of the
issues we deal with in the background
of sexual assault, including alcohol,
baring disorders and STDs.l “It's a dif»
ferentwayof presenting information,"
said Matye. “It’s personal, it’ll bring
up discussion questions, and give in'.
formation about numbers of sexual as-
sault cases and what it really means.
It'll bring it close to home, but not too
close to prevent identifying the issues.”

Golden-MeNetney said, “Diversity
is probably one of the most difficult
issues we have at Grinnell." To help
address problems that sprung from
diversity issues, she proposed that sena-
tors should meet with representatives
ofmulticultural groups.

Venugopal said, “We
multicultural students. . We lost: many
ofthe multicultural students that come
to Grinnell because they feel threat.
erred in a small town community, be.
cause they don’t feel welcome." He
would work to address this issue.
Venugopal also sought to cmphasirc
the role multiculturalism plays. “Die

dcntswirh different backgrounds and

other," he said.

Hines said that the definition of
diversity extends to include “students
of different races, ideas, and socioeco-
nomic backgrounds." Ar Grinnell, he
belicvrd student Affairs ought to be

“The problem with increased di.

that a lot of the faculty is tenured al-

more professors to bc hired.
Major said that not only is it im-

portrnt to ltitc minority professors, it
should be a priority to increase the
diversity ofcourses available.

Dunhnm suggested addressing di-

that hiring more professors might al-

posed capstone course.

Like many other candidates, Aetni
expressed his interest in multicultural
issues.

Dinnervillc approached diversity
from a very different perspective. He
suggested Gtinnell’s location in cen.
tral Iowa might be detrimental to at»
ttacting professors. “Iwould not push
‘multicultural‘.oriented classes just
because DIVCO demanded that SGA
do so in a closed meeting."

A student audience asked the can-
didates to elaborate the approaches

Aerni emphasized the importance
of compromise in most situations.
“Don't issue an ultimatum without
100% ofstudent support," he said.

Dunham said that assertiveness
was fundamental. “Some ofus are paye
ing $25,000 a year to go here and we
don't want to be pushed around.”

Dinnerville was careful to emphae
size that although compromise has a
role in negotiations, “in certain areas
there can be no compromise."

In most cases, however, Major
emphasized the importance of “come
promises. We give a little on their de-
mands, they give a little on ours.

civcttini also emphasized that

and get the support they need?”

“It's a challenge to reach out to
people who wouldn't go to these pro-
scnrations,” said Matyc, “People think
that sexual assault isn’t a problem or
that they don’t contribute to the prob—
lem, They don't see themselves as a
perpetrator: ur ‘survivor.”’

“We also want to recruit people to
facilitate the orientation program.
‘When Hcllo gets out ofHand,’ which
has been popular for the last three
years," she added. .

At the end of last ycar, Mrryc,
Lanna, and schaalman worked to.

vocal and impacting presentation on
acquaintance rape.

“She wasa Vcrylargc benefit to the

how sKocsrncr helped (hem 'rcalirc

“As far as I’m concerned," said
Meredith Norfolk, ’99, “there's always
more to learn and get informed about,
to keep everyone aware ofthesc issues.
The issue isn't ovcr after the Sexual

“It would be nice to get more
people involved in the issue, even if

said Norfolk.
