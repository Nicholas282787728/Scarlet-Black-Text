McConnell

entertains

the eating
journalist

from page 1

that it was a planned coincidence
that this night happened to be
steak dinner. He also categorical-
ly denied that there had been a
rise in student complaints. that
the meals had become mundane
and that ‘more cassernle’ is bit)-
degradable.

Actually. Dave has to he given a
pat on the back for getting rid of
the paper mache' granola and (or
bringing in bagels on Sunday mor-
ning.

The nextday Karwoski sampled
the breakfast and lunch. both of
which promised to be real tongue
ticklers.

But let's not get carried away
here Karwoskl seemed a little in
timidated by McConnell's
presence and skirted the real
questions such as “What's the big
stripped thing hanging on the east
wall in Cowles'?" or "Why don't
you ever serve everyone's
iniorite. chopped eggs. cheese
chunks in “bits sauce with green
things iloriling in ii on least for
special dinner""
