$700 in donations to the program,

“Its a really nicc activity,” sriid Colin, “and l

Joint Board passes GCC resolution

[-7 P sees resolution as part of national ﬁght for the environment

By David Nathan
Staff Writer

last week Joint Board adoptcd n Frec-tlic-Planct
(FTP) sponsored resolution to refrain from invest—
ing Collcgc money in members ofthe Global Cli-
mate Coalition, a Washington, DC based lobby
group.

The GCC claims there is insufﬁcient scientiﬁc
evidence to confirm the dangers ofglobal warming
because ofgteenhouse gases,

According to Grinnoll Treasurer David Clay,
Grinncll College ncithcr currently owns nor his
torically owned equity in the largest members of

'GCC.

ctinnell College's equity holdings are managed
in part by the Grinnell Investment Committee,
made up othustec-s, and by an cxtcmal fund, which
is managed by an outside firm, The investment
committee manages approximately 30 percent of

the holdings in what the college calls the lnternal
portroiio, which is mndc up ofstocks and bonds in
individual companies. The Ex»
tcrnul Portfolio, managed oils
campus, is made up oftwo mu.
tual funds: The chuma Fund
and a small international fund.

FTP's campaign to increasc
awareness is part ofa national
divestment campaign started
last spring by several other col»
logos and universities, includ-
ing l—larvatd, Stanford, and the university ofWash-
ington, This semester, FTP kicked off the diver-
ment campaign and members went door»to»dclor
collecting Signatures. By the end oftht drive, they
had received over 630 student nnd 28 faculty sig.
natures.

“we wanted to show Joint Board [hill there was

"We wanted to show the
Joint Board that there was
a lot of support for this
initiative in the dorms."

a lot ofsupport for this initiative in the dorms,"
said FTP founder Bill Holland ‘00, ”It’s the biggest
petition drive ever and we think
irshows ovcnvhclmingstudcnt
support.”

Holland feels the outpoure
ing of student participation
camc because of GCC’s active
role in what he sees as purpose»
ful misleading the public, One
petition signer, who wished not
to be identiﬁed, pointed to
headlines on the GCC webpage (http:/I
wmv.globalclimatc.org/) such as “A Warmer World
May Not Be Bad" and “To Reuters Ncws, C02 is a
Poisonous Gas" calling thcm “biased, big business
crap."
