Students/ trustees offer differing opinions

by Jim Goodfellow ,

The college trustees held an open
loruiii vttlh students lor the lirst time
last Friday. Students expressed Opk
iiions and raised questions on topics
ranging troni the college's l’inancial in-
tet'ests in South AlriC‘dl’l based
bustnesses to the inconvenience ol mov-
ing due to dorm renovations The
trustees listened. replied and admitl)
vteuthered a 1th instances‘ot student
anger or antipathy

A healthy airing 0] opinions, some oi
“hiL'h Vtill produce little in terms 0] stu-
dent input into college policy, is all that
happened. Concerned students may call
such results meager. They must
realize, hou ever, that such results are
not due to any insenstttvtty on the part
ol the trustees but rather u dilierent
perspective ol what constitutes sudent
interest.

The trustees are concerned \th the
Vlellure ol the institution and measure
student interest over time. The college
uellare reduces iundamentally to
luliillntent oi enrollment targets Villh
quality high school students. College
policy may often aim at the interest oi
luture students at the expense o_l those
already enrolled.

the perceptual diilerence oi student
interest underlined the discussan at the
college 5 investments in South A|rican
based bustnesses. Joel Robbins stood
thlh about 20 others and read u petition
signed by about one-hall ol the student
body which deplored such investments
acquiescence to the government's HpaP
theid policy

The trustees seemed to share the opi-
nion that the investments are tn the best
interests at the college viithout bolster
ing the government, Trustee Donald
Stevt art, draining lrom his recent trip to
South AlriCd. claimed that even coili-
plete disinvestmcnt by all Americans
Vlould probably not phase the economy,
"I got the idea that the South Alricans
really dont give a damn about our
divesting. he said

Fritz M ytag, chariman oi the Board
01 Trustees, Justilied the investments
on linancial grounds. "Une 0! our ii 1
responsibilities as trustees ts the linan-
cial security ol‘ the college, ' he said

From the trustees point 01 vieo
t'inancial security or a large endoii-
menl makes Grinnell more attractive
to prospective students. One trustee
touched on their veiu paint during mlorr
mul conversation. He ielt that enrolled
students do not olten consider .college
policy in the long term and that the
trustees must.

The trustees seemed to equate the in-
stltution‘s and the prospective students
interests. They seemvchielly concerned
vtilh huvt to make Grinnell more'attrac»
ttve to the shrinking student m'arkel.

Une student telt that the trustees should

act quickly to lind permanent housing ,

on campus tor the college art collection.
Trustee Carolyn Bucksbaum discussed
permanent housing in the context oi
luture students‘ interests.

She lelt that the optimal solution
would take time to formulate, "We need
a uay to have some or this art, the
prints in particular. which would give
students access to It as source material.
This uould give Grinnell something
other schools don thave. ' The trustees
tailed to address directly the students
desire to hdve access to the collection.
This suggests that the trustees do not
tocus primarily on the interests at
enrolled students.

The dillering perceptions ol student
interest has at the core 01 the discus
ston oi the recruitment of blacks.
Trustee James Loury admitted that.
"We have not been successtul as pro
blem solvers.‘ The college will launch
soon a black student exchange program
with Spelman College in order to make
the black community more aviare ol
Grinnell.

Stevtart reasoned that Grinnell can-
not easily lure black prospectives. the
black students that Grinnell ts looking
[or are the students other institutions
are looking tor. Because the older and
richer schools are m the Northeast they
get first crack.‘

Such an assessment raises questions
concerning Just hovi committed the ad.
ministration is to the recruitment of
blacks. It Grinnell cannot easily be
made more attractive to blacks a
serious recruitment ettort would have
little payoii in terms ol the institutional
interest, Th rationale lor the exchange
program With Spelman suggests such
thinking on the part of the trustees, "tl
vie try toattack tthe problem oi recruit
ment ol blacks) in the normal way vte
can never succeed,‘ Lou ry said,

The discussion concerning the ac-

celerated dorm renovation schedule
most sharply brought out the difference
between trustee and enrolled student
perceptions A student living in Rawson
complained that the acceleration came
as a costly surprise. Moving could take

, nearly a day oi his time and he will

have proiessional exams that week.

He charged that the acceleration lg»
nores the interests of those living in
Rawson and Gates. "We petitioned and
theadministration iinaliy replied that
it's too bad that the students have to be
inconvenienced. My investment with
my money is my time and the capacity
to spend my time constructively," he
said.

Trustee Robert Burnett replied that
the acceleration vtould minimize stu-
dent lnconvenience in the future. “l‘he
renovation plan has been undethuy tor
a long time and is a very complicated
process. The primary consideration in
planning “as to minimize inconve:
nlence to students, By making this
move nou, we'll prevent two moves
next year, he said

The same student dismissed such
reasoning as irrelevant to his interest
"You talk about making this a better
place (or students in the luture but the
luture ioi~ me is novt he said.

The student then suggested a means
to reach the trustees more ettectively.
"1 hope you realize the magnitude ot
what I aim saying. There are a lot ol
people vtho are real mad. The whole
thing could get out.‘ he said. Such
publicity could only render Grinnell
less attractive to prospectives.

The publication at student concerns
which the udministralton deals with "IV
property could diminish the perceptual
gap between students and trustees. The
distribution at such a publication to pro
spectives would better enable the
trustees to perceive the link betvteen
student and institutional concerns.
