Wagner Disputes Tennis Scoring

Holds Opinion
Grinnell Won

Official Ruling Expecfed
wl'llCl'1 May Change
Announced Slanding

Tennis coach Oliver Wagner
stated today that as he un-
derstands the Scoring system

used in the Mid-West confer-
ence tennis meet last weekend,
Grinncll should have been crowned
conference champions instead of
cc-champions. There has been a
discrepancy as to the number of
points awarded to the individual
champions in singles and doubles
matches that accounts for the
difference.

As the score was first released
Lawrence and Grinnell were tied
with 18 points, but according to
Wagner's and several other
coaches' understanding, the score
should have been Grinnell 20 and
Lawrence 18. Wagner expects an
official ruling later.

Lord Wins Singles.

sterling Lord, Grinnell's number
one man, won the conference
singles championship with very
little trouble. He was by far the
most outstanding player in the
meet and did not lose a set in
the four matches that he played,
according to Wagner. Ed Gilbert,
Grinnell’s other singles entry
advanced to the semi-finals. He
and Gene PeiSner were downed in
the first round of the doubles
competition,
