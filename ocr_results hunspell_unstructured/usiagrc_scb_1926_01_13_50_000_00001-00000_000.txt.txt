The Crinnell basketball team up»
eued its season last Saturday night
at st. Joseph by succumbing to the
powerful Hillyard quintet: 34 to 24.

Although on the short end of the
scoie Black’s cagers won a psychologr
icol victory in that they surprised
even their most optomistic backers by
their fine showing against a team
which is probably one of the best in
the United States, including proies-
siolial. college and amateur fives,

“Hap" Moran who performed at
center was the main cog oi the or
nell attack as he accounted for six-
teen oi his team’s total. He hit the
loop seven Limes and round the way
from the foul line tw-loe.

Guards Axe Surprise

midi-ans spectacular playing was
expected, however, and it was the
brilliant showing of ,the Pioneer
guards. W ng and Niblo which was
the surprise DI the game. The guard
problem had been aunsidepgd a 59...
ions one but if Captain Wing and Nihlo
periorin consistently as hey did
against the Hi _ rds, oppos lg lives
will meet with stubborn opposition
this year. It was iiiblo‘s first game
for a varsity live, but he played every
minute. '

The chemists grabbed a lead early
in the game but by the time ten min
utes had been played the score was
tied at nine all by vlrme of woven-s
basket eye The Hillyal‘ds then drew
away and led Is to 9 at the half. a

ten poiut margin which they did not‘

increase in the second half. The Pier
neers drew close in the second period
but were unable to match the huskY
experienced foes.

The Hillyards were led by Rody,
former University of Missouri star
who scored six times from the floor.
Mueller counted three times and
Wolf, famous ex-Kansas center also
made a trio of counters. De Eernitrrli,
all-American. who played a while at
center did not register.

The Grinnell attack was weakened
early in the game when Chase, the
only letter forward, was knocked out
so that he was unable to resume play.
Lamb, Doiiing and Peterson did the
remainder of the sei ice at the ion
word positions, Dotting and Peter on
each registering once. It was “Red"
Peterson's first taste o; varsity bass
ketball.

Sport writers seem to think
the shouing of the G—rinnell team
against the Hillyards points to a
good showing in the valley this sea-
son, The Des Moincs Sunday RogiSA
ter says that it was the hardest game
of the year for the l-Iillyards and cons
tiiiues to say "It was the ﬁrst game
of the se on tor Coach Charles
Black's Iowa aggregation and their
showing against the Hillyards is won
thy of a boast that the team should
go well in the Missouri Valley
ference this year.’

In praise of Moran the Register-
said, '“In addition to Moran’s scoriné
his floor work was good. He is an
ideal player around which to con-
struct a team and that is what Coach
Black has done."

Foreign Policy

Editors note—Frank Dewey, Crin-

nell representative at the Prince~

ton world coin-t conference has

made a carelul study or the court

and has prepared the following ar

ticle for the Scarlet and Black.
(Frank Dewey)

The United states Senate has been
strongly urged by several ol‘gunizae
tions, during the past few months, to
join the Permanent Court of Internal:
ional Justice. Among others. the
Alilel'i n Bar Association, American
Federation of Labor, the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, the
Federal Council of Churches, the Gen-
eral Federation or Woinn's Clubs, and
now the college men and women of
the country, have sent resolutions to
the Senate Committee on Forcign Res
lations, asking ior such action \\'ltl.l~
out delay ‘

The great body oi public opinion
which has been aroused both for and
against our entrance into the World
Court might seem to indicate that
whether we enter oi not is a matter
of great weight; although we already
have the privilege of taking disputes
to the Court, on Ame ‘can Judge now
sits as one or,the eleven judges, and
our country is represented in the
nomination oi all judges. In the elec-
tion of judg s, however, we do not
take part. oining the Court would
give us a vote in the election of judge
es, and entitle us to pay our share of
the annual expenses, which would
amount to about thirty-five thousand
dollars each year.

World Court Is Test Case Of U. S.

Says Frank Dewey

But something more than these
minor changes must be involved, olse
wliy all the disturbance? The irrecc
oncilaliles arc not opposing the Court
in order to save the country th ty.
five thousand dollars a year, nor aie
the organizations mentioned spending
all their euorts towards securing for
us merely a voice in the election of
judges. Both proponents and Opponr
ents seem to think that the Senate is
considering a new tonlgn policy, a
policy which will be initiated by our
acceptance of membership in therei»
mnncut Court of International JuSA
lice. ‘

For several years we have refused
to cooperate with other nations of the
woild. We have barked back to the
centul‘yrold Monroe Doctrine in den
fence of a policy of isolation, we have
been overebusinesslikc in demanding
money due us; as yet we have taken
no part in the attempts being made
by European nations to make war in
the future less likely. We are about
to apologize for our attitude of late
years. We are about to take an active
part again in international affairs.

One oi the arguments brought for-
\ u'(l against the Court. has been that
it intended to be a back door entry
into the League of Nations. As a mate
for of fact, although the expenses or
the Court are paid from the League
treasury, and although the judges are
elected by the Assembly and Council
of the League, and the Court may be

DEBATE ,lEAM lBAlElS

“'Ui‘li’, lleuitt mill Illu‘lillg‘ulllc Coni-

James Work, '26, Randolph Hewitt,

journey to Calesburg. Illinois, to meet
Lliiiox College Thursday night on the
proposition, “Resolved, that the Unit.
ed States should subsidize its com.

Grinnell, taking the negative of the
proposition, will be well represented
in the men chosen. Work was a meni-
ber of the team that met Oxford last
year, and was anchor man of the team
that debated Cambridge this fall; he
has also taken part in other intercol-
legiate debates, Hewitt is stepping
into varsity circles ior his iirst timer
but on the basis of a very creditable
tiyout will hold up an important link
in the negative case, Burlingame
joined the varsity squad last year, do-
ing effective work against Antes.
Creighton and Knox, and was a mem-
ber of the team that met Cambridge.

The calibre of Coach Shaw’s men
needs no introduction to Grinnell dev

will be fully as interesting as the
meet on the local campus Friday evo-

The second or the all-college talk
festivals will be held tomorrow night
in the association's building in the
place of the regular Y. M. and Y.‘ W.
meetings. This plan is a novel one
and was introduced on the Grinnell
campus at the last meeting of the V1.
It was so enthusiastically received
that it will be continued.

The last meeting left one para—
mount question in the minds of one
group unsettled and so tomorrow
night Dean Findlay \v‘lll lead a. group
in discussing “Should Grinnell have a
required course iii religion?" some
conclusion will be reached, it not.
the question will hold over until next
week.

in answer to repeated question and
to act as a means of getting opinion,
hIai-tha Hawley will lend a group in
discussing “Development of person-
nlity i‘n quadrangle and dormitory
life" and determine whether there
really is a distinct Grinnell type.

The third group will be lead by
Ralph Smiley on the question or “Es
scutial requirements for graduation.”
Ellcll person who desires to be in
this group is asked to bring a list or
requirements he thinks should be in
eliect. This promises to be one or

The game with the Jayh'awkers to-
inori-ow night will be the first Valley
conference contest for the Séarlet and
Black cagei-s and a victory over last
year's Valley champs would give the
Pioneers plenty of confidence for
their other battles. The game with
the Hillyard team showed that the
the Grinnell quintet ,has plenty of
strength and if they bolster their de-
iense, ought to go a long way in the
race for Valley honors. In this game

snagging seven field goals and two

points.

because they had been active in Cain-
