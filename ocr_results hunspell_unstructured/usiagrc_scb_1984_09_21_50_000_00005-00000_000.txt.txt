Board's $350.00 allocation to the
Journal presents problems

Shortly after this Wednesday's
J is meeting l was approached by
representatives oi a group called
C.R.P.E A.G (Community to
Revitalize Progressive Education
and Activities at Grinnelli with a
request ior iunding tor a liberal
publication. I believe the request
tor iunding is a legitimate
response to a genuine campus
need, The difficulty associated
\\|tl1 iunding both publications is
obvious: SGA has at limited
budget, Although the requests are
legitimate. we cannot realistically
fund all requests ior new student
publications nor can we arbitrarr
ly deny iunding to one cause vlhile
granting it to another. This
realization has led me to conclude
that the best solution to Student
Government's dilemma is to suppe
ly limited iunding to both publica
tions While reduced allocations
may make pi-oiessional printing
impossible, 1 am coniidenl that
reduced allocations \\’Ill suffice it

at neit vicck‘s meeting on, will
reduce its lunding allocation in ac-
cordance with the budgetary
restraints that limit Student
Government's actions.

While I lee] that the solution I
have suggested in the preceding
lines is one that is [air and in the
interests or the student body as a
whole. it is not within my pow s
SGA President to alter Joint
Board's decision. I encourage all
students who have an interest in
this issue to talk with their hall
presidents and attend next week‘s
meeting. I apologize for my
iailure to suggest this solution on
Wednesday night and 1 hope that
my mistakc will not cause anyone

Before such an examination I
shall quickly discuss Mr.
Namara's letter and its critiques.
Mr McNamara has provided us
with an eloquent picture of how he
believes the media is reintorcing
some nationalistic “values of the
mass public which watches
primertime TV," Certainly the ac-
tion oi the international olympic
Committee chairperson warning
ABC oi its onersided Journalism is

MaNamara's claim 01 a nav

Mr. McNamara's argument more

To the Editor:

lam extremely upset by the bla-
tant misuse oi Editor's Notes in
last week‘s Scarlet and Black

I had Just tinished reading an
excellent letter to the Editor by
Nicole Etcheson. which espoused
some thoughtiul and interesting
ideas, among them being the sup
port oi Truman's bombing oi
iiiroshima Then I was hit right
between the eyes by an Editor's
Nolt ..ic iirst sentence oi which
read 'Alomic blasts rarely. in
deed save llves." Now just what
exactly is that comment doing
there? I had always understood
that although these letters begin
with "To the Editor." that open
ing was not meant to be taken
literally-7itwewantcd to write to
the Editor personally, we would
write to his Post onice box 'l'hcse

the Editor, taking his queue irom
last week. add an Editor's Note:
“Pretzels and cheese dip taste ex-
tremely bad, and anyone who ad-
vocates their consumption on

In my view. the use of the

have been obycciionablc even if
they had made any sense. it the

lo the Editor:

Thank you and reporter Leisa
Knettle tor your coverage oi the
Campus Democrats in last week's
issue. Vtegappreciate the chance to
describe our activities. promote
voting in Iowa. and gain a little
more name recognition tor the
Democratic candidates

There were two errors in the ar-
ticle‘, however. which we would
like to correct l-‘irst. although we
are iryiiig to arrange one. we are
not sponsoring an October I5
debate between Third District
congressional candidates
Democrat Joe Johnston and
Republican Cooper Evans, So
rather than coming to South
Lounge that evening and being
disappoiiilt’d. we encourage peo-
ple to watch the debate on Chane
nel 7

The second correction concerns
the same race, Contrary to the
report in the article. Johnston is
not an incumbent Office holder,
Unfortunately. Evans is the ins
cuinbent in that election.

Again. thanks tor the publicity
