Frisbee Golf community grows

BY MAX CALENBERG

When Dan McCue first arrived in 2006 to take a position
as Assistant Director of Alumni Relations at Grinnell College
he brought more than just his job qualiﬁcationhhc brought
a hohhy.

Now that the snow has mostly melted and three layers are
no longer required to walk outside, it is time to start spending
more time outdoors. Over the past two years, Frisbee Golf has
become a great way to do this due to the creation ofa new 18-
hole course and the development ora strong community in the
Grinnell area,

“I was driving around when I ﬁrst got in, I had seen the
9-hole course there on the north side of campus near the athletr
ic facilities.l thought, ‘Oh this is great, I didn’t know Grinnell
a disc golrcourser"

After a closer inspection though, McCue found the course
to not he in the best of shape.

“There are no si ns, no tee pads, or anything, so I didn't re-
ally know what was hole] one or what was nine," McCue said.

Eventually, McCue found Dave Eberbach ’89, another disc
golrenrhusiast, who showed him the way a majority otpeople
played the course. The two, along with some other locals de-
cided they wanted a course that offered a bit more.

“Dave and I started talked and we wanted to take what was
already on campus with the 9-hole course and kind or take it up
another level, so we looked at a few different spots on campus
and in the community,” McCue said. “After talking with the
city we.. identiﬁed Lake Nyanza as the best place."

Now that they had a location at the south end of High
Street, they needed funding.

“The College gave us a miniegrant to help purchase baskets

and other equipment, we got a grant from the Grinncil Tour-
ism Board, and then we had some individuals in the community
step upwe received full funding,"McCue said.

The first nine holes were installed in May 2009, with the
back nine following later in the summet,To celebrate, the newly
formed Grinnell Disc Golf Club hosted the “Inaugural Goose
Poop Open” over Labor Day weekend 2009, which had a solid
turnout or around 30 peopleThere was also the formation ofa
league, which meets once a week and has an optional huy in of
three dollars,whieh goes toward a purse to he won by me first
place hnisher that day.

The efforts of the Grinnell Disc Golf Club are paying off,
as people who haven't played in years are once again picking up
a disc.

“I started playing in grad school in 1996 or 1998,maybc,1
played {or a couple years there and then i didn’t play alpha until
just this last year," Monty Roper, Anthropology, said. “I was ex-
cited to go out and play with a group."

When the snow came, the golfers continued to brave the
elements, even hosting the Grinnell Freeze on Feb. 21 tournae
ment which drew around 50 players from all over lowa.

“For league, when it was the summer and the fall,we’d usur
ally get 10 to 15, over the winter time we’d had some days when
we have close to 10...so yeah it has dropped orr,"McCue said,

Now that the weather has picked back up, McCue atpects
participation to rise with the temperature.

Use orthe course is free and league play will move from its
current Saturday noon slot to Mondays at 5:30 pm. starting
April 5, all levels of players are encouraged to join. Those in—
terested in can visit the Club‘s website at grinnelldirrrlllb.org or
