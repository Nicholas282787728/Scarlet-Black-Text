Ross Koon 06 finds Grlnnell much le ressful now than
when he was a srudcnr Afrc graduating May, Koon stayed
at Grinnell as a ninthtseni er Air department inrcrn. He said
that] non-student status i like “limbo.“hut it is an in-bc-
twe in that rants him much more freedom and time for
his sculpture work. ‘

Although he srrll goes to a tew parties off campus, Koon
said, “You're in a very different place than you were four years
ago I've spent a lot more nights doing what i wanted to be
doing, watching movies with friends, doing much more laid—
back things,"

Two other members of the ‘
Graeme Millei, have
elected to remain on
campus in posrcgraduc
ate programs in Theatre
and Music, respectively.
Miller will also remain
for a ninth semester and
Cawrhon will stay fol a
full fifth ycar.

The postgraduate
programs were devel-
oped to allow Grinncll
students the oppoituni~
ty to add to rhcir port-
folios before applying
to graduate school. The
programs, for which the
interns applied last year, also give them tiruc to contemplate
further education oi professional work in their fields.

Koon said that the previous ninthtselucster studcnr, Rachel
Dobkin ’05, told him it was one of the loneliest times to be in
Grinnell because ofthe sense ofdisconnectedness.

But accortlint; to Millei, the shift fiom student to intern
status is not netessaiily a negative one. ‘1 act to expeiience

Miller's position
as the Music depait-

iecipient allows him to
increase his experience

enter.

His duties also hit
elude being a teacher's assistant in two music classes while he
decides whether graduate school is sonicrhing he would like to
pursue.

Koon’s work for his Arr department fellowship builds offof
sculpture pieces he developed for a salon last year as a senior.
Like Miller, he is arrempring ro “bccfup“ his portfolio in anticl»
patiou ofpossibly applying to graduate school, although he has
not yet clarified his plans for the future.

“thn you sct up a nurnhcr of pieces in rhis amounr of
rimc.I feel like you build a structure where it is hard to work
in," he said. For now, he is focusing on a preparing a show {or
the end of fall semester,

Cawthon's work this year has already proved invaluable
to the Theatre department, especially with the departuie of
professor Pip Gordon from the department and an increased
workload for Technical Director Erik Sanning,

She will work for the clinic ycar as a Technical Intern for
rhc dcparrrncnr, helping with art design as well as building and
supervising in the scene shop,

sannirrg said, “[Kathy] can guide rhe other stafr members

Phynding new ways to cope

A year after demise of popular Grinnell file-sharing service, students find creative ways to download new music

BY BETHANV PROSSEDA 8t CHLOE MORYL

once upon a time, Griuneilians could ac-
quire unlimited music files ar the click of a
button. With a simple web search, students
could choose from a huge array of files and
download with little iisk ofviruses.

This sharing was facilitated by a website
called Phynd. which allowed users to search
an index of shared files and folders on the
Grinnell network. This let netwoik users play
or download movies and music from other
compurersr However, in slimmer 2005, ITS die
vided the campuSrWide ResNet network into
12 smaller suhnets. With no campus-wide
network to search, Phynd became a thing of
the past.

Justin Abramson '08. like many upperclass

mcn.lamenrs the loss ofrhc progl‘am,“\7\/hcnl
was a freshman, we had Phynd it was really
cool to have and it is a shame that it was done
away with, since there's not much downloadt
ing on campus at all anymore," he said,

With the loss ofPhynd,students have been
forced to find more creative ways to obtain new
music. some, of coursc,purchasc CDs or putt
chase individual songs through interact scrc
viees like iTunes and Napster. Students have
also turned to illegal iTuncs offshoots like My-
Tunes and OurTunes, which allow the user to
download from others" iTunes music libraries.

Students may also use illegal downloading
programs like Limewire and Kazan, although
college firewalls prcvenr rhe use of these pro-
grams. Firewalls are security schemes on rhc

collcgc ncrwork that control rhe transfer or
some kinds of information within rhe nctt
work.

“1 used to use file sharing all the time and i
really wish rhar we could use search programs
here at Grinnell," said Kari: Battaiii '09s “It
was convenient and easy, and now we have to
find roundabout ways to do the exact same
thing. People are going to find a way to do it
anyway."

Megan Germer '08 shared Barrani’s sent
timentr “Now, wirhout any way to download
music, I kind of feel like Grinnell is cut off
from the music scene a lot," she said,"1t’sjusr
a lot more difficult to share and listen to difc
ferenr music”

Some students, however, have found other

ways to obtain music for free. Mike Kober
'10. who like other underclassnien was never
exposed ro Phynd, has made use orhis external
hard drive. “I found someone on campus who
had a lot of music that I wanted, so I copied
the music front his computer onto my exter-
nal hard drive. then copied rhc music from the
external hard drive back onto my computer,"
he said.

The loss of thnd has undoubtedly
cramped Grinnell's music-sharing syle some-
what, and it isn’t as easy as it once was to find
“Like :1 Prayer” at the click ofa button, Hth
ever, between legal subscription services, illen
gal programs and old-fashioned sharing with
peers, smdents are still finding creative ways to
expand their music libraries.

Punked-out alum returns to roCk Bob’s

Concert Preview:

The Punks

Sunday, Sept. 24
9:00 pm.
Bob’s Underground Cafe

BY TRVMORE MAGOMANA

John Chavez '05 makes his triumphant re-
turn ro Grinncll this weekend as a member of
The Punks, which he desCiibes as a “flee form
irrrprov-hascd"band.

The four-emcmber band, which performs
on Sept. 24 in Bob's Underground. defies deft
nition by combining different genres. “The
Punks play music that is solidly Experimental,"
Chavez said. “We utilize traditional instru-
ments to non—traditional means."

The Olympia, VVashrbased band was
founded three years ago by nonvGi'innellians
Ben Parrish and Slim Moon. Chavez, who
plays cffccrcd guitar, joined shordy thereafter.

Chavez, who was SGA Concerts chair as
a student, said that “playing in a band after

school was natural and inevitable."

Chavez also runs a booking agency for
cusccl nn indcpcndcur bands,The Frcc Agen—
cy, which he formed under the tutelage of a
friend. He said, “I was destined for a career in
the music industry"

Cl c has received uncondirional support
from l . family, even rhough they can't always
hum along ro his music. “My father is excited
that the blind is touring the country and ger-
ring offers to fly around the world and play
shows," he said.

Friends who remember Chavez from his
Grinnell clays appmvc or his new gig. “The
Punks’ inus'ie stands out in that it’s niilch
more eerie, much more meandering and sim»
ply more engaging than a lot of the other shit

out there," said Chavez’s t’iiend Nick Zurko
'07 in an email, "It's purposclcss and in-
tentional at the same times Ir hovers over
your dome and rests there,- Like a little halo
ofsmoke—it can be really quite beautiful
and obnoxious, and then things just become
confusing."

zutko said the Punks' impressive succ
cess is in line with Chavez's personality.
"Well, Chavez is what some might call a
'born husrlcr,’cveryday he’s htrsciirr," he said.
“Dude knows how ro make things happen.
So while I was amazed that The Punks. a
young baud compared to the other stalwarts
pct-forming, were going ro play The Wire
festival, I wasnr exactly surprised because
John always moved at a much quicker pace
than most."
