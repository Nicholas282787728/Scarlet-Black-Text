at Sunday Vesper Service

Presentation of “A Scientific Define
ition of Religion” was the purpose at
J, D. Stoops, pofessor ot‘ philosophy,
in his vesper address Sunday.

The uhard.hoiled, academic, sciene
tiiic type of mind” avoids the emo-
tional approach to religion as it
leaves no place for growth or develop—
ment, the speaker asened.

Nature and religion are more and
more inseparably linked in the mind
of the modem student, Dr. Stoops
continued. The student is conscious
of a personal relationship with nature
He sees himself as the instrument of
nature and explains his activity as
the activity of a universal power, oper-
ating through himself.

Only through aceptance of the vital
part nature holds inreligion is Cone
tinual human growth explainable, Dr
Stoops declared Hence, he concluded,
only a religion which accepts this close
association oi the two can appear can»
Sistent to the Scientific mind.
