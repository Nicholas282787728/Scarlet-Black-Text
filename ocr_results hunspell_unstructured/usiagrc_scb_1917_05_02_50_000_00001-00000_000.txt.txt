Grinnell and Drake will mix in their
annual track and ﬁeld meet at Dos
liloincs ncxt Saturday, weather and
war permitting. Final arrangements
have not been completed, hut will be
closed up the latter part of this week.

The strength 01 Drake this year is
unknown, as also Gl'mnell's. As it
as can be asccrtdiucd Drake has all
their point winners of last year with
the exception of “Red" Slicaie Drew,
their negro athlete, is not eligible to
compete, as ﬁrst year men are e
cludcd. This will also prevent G n—
llelLl'l‘oll—‘i using the lrcshincn.

Dope ls Scarce.

The absence of dopc is due to the
fact that this is the ﬁrst meet or the
year. Hth not the Coo dual 01 last
Saturday been called oh, the outcomc
wo'uld have given a good idea oi: Grin-
nell’s s rengtli. From the result hf
last year's meet, Gi-inuell should win,
but the local camp is not in any stage
or Certainty. Prcscnt indications make
Grinncll look stronger on the track
but weaker in tho ncld than a ycar
ago. The latter is the only place that
the war has seriously been felt. The
absence or Augustine and John Miller
will undoubtedly he felt.

A squad of approximately thirty
men will make the trip. It is planned
now that they will leave on the early
train Saturday morning.

This would make it possible to hold

In a game featured by mud, blood
and funny situations, the Freshmen
continued their onward march toward
a pei-lect percentage in the class hase-
ball series with a 1% victory over the
lowly Sopbs last night. This is the
second game in which the Preps have
trimmed their Sophomore enemies,
and it also makes the third consecu-
tive win for thc Freshmen.

Air 'l'igd Game.

The game was an a' ight battle
until tho last hall or the sixth ronnd.
At that time the Sophs were one run
to the good, vTillL tiic ycai-liiigs could
not be stopped. and ﬁve succcs ‘ve
hits, several stolen bases and innum—
erable eri-oi were cnnilgh to put the
game out or roach ot the second year
men. All in all, only nttccn errors
were made in the game, and the
Freshmen can lay claim to ten of
those. This casualty list ' accounted
for by the mlldl ﬁeld, which made
the ball mighty 'ppery at times.

1 core Is Fancy Diwl'.

The wet spots around the bases
were also productive of more or less
ludicrous actions on the part at tic
players, Saucrinan tried to lip into
