Pioneers To Face Drake
Runners In Annual

Dual Affair

BY \VELLS BARNETT

Grinnell college runners will
3105c their 1937 home season here
Friday afternoon when they will
meet the thin-olads from Drake
university in a dual affair sched.
uled to start at 3:45 p.m.

it is probable that Drake will
ilso bring a freshman team to
:oinpete with the Pioneer year-
hngs, but definite announcement
of plans for the freshman meet
have not yet been made.

Pioneer chances Goof].

For the first time in several
years, the Pioneer team will be
:Lble to compete on even or better
than-even terms with the Bull-
logs. Drake, with a team com—
posed of several individual stars,
has been particularly strong in-
relay meets, but the Pioneer’s
Wellebnlanced team. with few in-
dividual stars but strength in el-
-nost every event, is better as a
dual meet team.

Additional hope for the Pioneer
cause has been furnished by the
announcement that Robinson and
smith, star Drake sprinters, will
probably not compete as a result
of injuries suffered in the can»
:erence meet at St, Louis last
week.

Smith, Robinson.

if Smith and Robinson do not
‘ompete, the Pioneers can practi.
rally assure themselves of taking
both the sprint events. In addi-
Lion, Grinnell should capture both
hurdle events, although Tulin of
Diake may figure as a strong
contender.

Lynn Schlotterheck is a good
bet to win the quarter-mile dash,
and possibly lower the meet rec—
ord of :50 seconds flat established
