For a senior, the Last New Things

“Why are there two ortvolopes>" Mnry
asked me, on rt paiticulnrly sunny :lfteinoon
inst weelt, Her question, regarding gmduntion
invitations, made me laugh. A few days earlier,
I had overlooked the doubleeenvelope filctor
myielfilnd sclitwled halfa dozen addresses on
the min-m- cnvelopcs, only to discover there
was no odhesrvo, no way to lick them shut.
As seniors, we’ve spent the prist fcw semes-
ters feeling Comfortnthn top of things
and thinking we knew rilitloot all we needed
to know about life here in Grinnell. We knew
which prtties to nttend nnd whrch professors
to ovoid. Whether rt wos giving presenter
tions rtnd writing pupers, plrying Ultirnntc or
throwing u successful pnrty,'\ve've been there,
done thnt, nnd become quite good nt it. Suds
denly now. in these frrst weeks of Mny, we're
doing some new things.

I've spent n great deal of money at the
