A GREATER CONTRIBUTION

“shall 1‘ enlist, or shall i wait until
I am called?" is the question nhich is
concerning erery Grinnell man today.

Nerer before in the histor' oi Grin-

T'nell has such a restless spill pervad-

p ed every meal, such a desire to contrrir
rite his part to a great cause, but never
heiore has such uncertainty existed
as to the right course to pursue.

Griunell is loyal tactile ,iast ditch,
its,ioyalty has never been doubted
But in his great zeal to “get into it,"
the Grinnell man and, in iact, the ar-
ei‘aige college inan. seems to take ilie
view that rniliraiy service is the only
kind or national sci-rice.

We are not condemning those who
hare gone. All honor to the inch who
have carried the G nueli Siiilii into
the haitle line, Th , lime done wlial

lives on the altar of lreedoin,
