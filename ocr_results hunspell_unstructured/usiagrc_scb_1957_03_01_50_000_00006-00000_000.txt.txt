League Board made a change
in the philosophy of study hall

The idea of conﬁnement for
a quiet place to study is being ’
introduced this semester. There
will be a ﬁfteen-minute break
instead oz only ﬁve minutes be-
tween sessions every evening
except Monday. Permissions will
be granted by Anne Beuckman
or Joyce Buck,_in extreme cas—
es, for typing papers in one's
room.

Anyone not conforming to
the rules or disturbing study
hall may be asked to leave
and will not be given credit.
The study hall clock is mas-
ter, and anyone coining aiter
the designated time'wul not
be admitted,

Typing, smoking, talking,
whispering, knitting, and magae
zine reading are not allowed.
Permission for excused absences
are to be secured before 7:30
pm. from Anne or Joyce. The
attendance slip must be signed
both periods. Girls are welcome
to attend voluntarily it there is
room.

Letter
Cont. from p. 2 l

we would be led in these intel—
lectual pursuits by our campus
newspaper.

Last week's 3&3 was eight
pages long. There was not one
single mention 0: any of the
above. Instead, three pages were
devoted to sports, and the edi»
torial and opinion columns were
devoted to that world—shaking
problem—the Student Council
convention.

During last fall’s political
'campaign, not one word oi
discussion or opinion on the
issues appeared in the paper’s
editorial columns. Thousands
of people died im- freedom in
Poland and Hungary _ noth-
ing in the 5&3,

May 1 conclude by quoting
from Dr. Kuntz: “Use your ﬁne
abilities to criticize something
worthy of ﬁrst place for Amer-e
ican students in the twentieth
century."

Sincerely,
Robert Barr
