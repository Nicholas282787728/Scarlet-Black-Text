 

Dropping like ﬂies:
semestral elections ,,
are to blame

They’ve been dropping like flies in the SGA ever since
break. Now, with the results of the new SGA elections in, we
find that 12 new representatives have been elected to Joint
Boards.

Second semester changes in student organizations are
something of an annual occurence at Grinnell, Every year it
seems that more and more people “bail out” of campus
organizations at the half year break, but this year's exodus
has been especially noticeableiparticularly in the SGA.

WHETHER THE new SGA election law (requiring
semestral rather than yearly election of hall representatives
and coordinators) is the sole reason for the large number of
changes in student government personnel is hard to say.
Certainly it had an effect.

The new law served to give some first semester
representatives an easy way out, a way to resign from office
without actually resigning. They simply did not run for
reelection.

OF THE 12 NEW representatives elected this semester,
only one was opposed by an incumbent representative In
other words, ll first semester representatives effectively
resigned That becomes a numbing figure when you consider
that there are only 23 dorm and off-campus representatives
in the SGA Almost 50 per cent “resigned."

It seems probable that a good number of those
representatives who ”resigned” would not have done so had
not the new election given them the opportunity to quit
without actually having to submit resignations. And we
believe that those students who feel a strong enough com-
mitment to both SGA and their dorm to run for represen»
Latl‘vewln‘ the'first place should not only have the per-
serverance and interest to stay with the job throughout the
entire year, but should be expected to.

SUCH A large change halfway in the year will naturally
cause problems. Last semester’s Joint Boards was hardly a
well oiled legislative body, but the addition of 12 new
representatives, 12 new personalities, will only make what
was a ponderous body even more unwieldy.

New appointments will have to be made, and committee
assignments will have to be thrashed outl Such a seemingly
minor problem as obtaining room phones for the newly
elected representatives has become a monster to the painful
tune of at least 3120. ’

ALL IN ALL, it probably Wasn't worth it. The
bureaucratic problems and the lack of continuity in the SGA
caused by the new semestral elections will more than out
weigh the benefits gleanediwhatever those might be. We
suggest that Joint Boards do away with the new election rule
as soon as it can be put on the agenda.

Letters to the editor

Stuart lambastes Greenberg; defends SGA

To' the editor: i hardly expected
Bob Greenberg to present anything

resembling an accurate picture of ~

last semester’s SGA in his Open
Space column. Even so, I was
amazed at this often irrational and
inaccurate tirade against Jon
Neiderbach and the SGA.

At first Bob states that the Joint
Boards sees its sole role as
dispensing money for campus
activities. Yet his criticisms of
SGA do not mention a Single
misspent penny but concentrate on
other SGA activities, Moreover,
whether Bob realizes it or not.
allocating the activities fee is a
very important function of the SGA
and it should be expected that this
duty will take up a considerable
part of SGA‘s time. Students
seeking funding other than $150 or
less from the Initiative Fund must
come to SGA for the money.

ONE OF last semester’s most
volatile issues was that of alcohol
policy. However, Bob does not view
the resolution of this issue as an
accomplishment, Why? Because
the policy he favoredino SGA
money spent on hard liquor,
period~was not the one adopted.

The policy adopted does solve the
problems it intended to solve. It
strictly limits the amount of money
spent on hard liquor; it assures
that the liquor supply will last the
whole party; it encourages
moderation in drinking, One more
thing Bob, it is more than cons
ceivable that the SGA could spend
more money on liquor for the
Loose Hall Ball that it did for
the James Gang Bang. It is definite
since, unfortunately, no SGA
money was spent on liquor for the
James Gang Bang while SGA funds
will provide each student With two
drinks at the Loose Hall Ball.

I AGREE with Bob that too much
time was spent on the South Alrica
issue, but Kent State was actually
discussed at only two meetings,
However, he is completely wrong
is blaming .lon tor the amount of
time spent. SGA spentthree weeks,
somewhat less than a month, on
South Alrica, Jon repeatedly urged

 

the SGA to take a final vote but he
cannot tell a representative to shut-
up, end debate, forcea vote, or stop
SGA from habling a proposal,
When one looks at What actually
went on at those three meetings it
is clear that Bob was much more
responsible for the delays than Jon
was. For example, just before the
final vote Bob called a quorum and
immediately walked out of the
meeting in an effort to further
delay a resolution of the issue,
BOB laments the SGA'S failure
to address the problems of Afr
iirmallve Action, after voting
against forming a committee to
deal with it; of EPC'S; and of
professor tenure and blames this
on .lon. Yet Jon cannot introduce
proposals in SGA. ll Bob wanted
SGA to address these problems
then why did he not propose any
sort of action? In fact, Bob made
only two proposals all semester.
One, which I seconded, was to
establish the office of
parliamentarian. The other was
to appropriate $200 for a speaker.
On the other hand, Jon continually
urged the. SGA to consider the
problems of EPC‘s and tenure.

The shortcomings of last
semester’s SGA should not be
blamed on Jon but on the reac-
tionary segment of the Joint
Boards as typified by Bob. All
semester Jon had to struggle with
a hostile SGA and a student body
that misunderstood him. In View of
all he has had to contend with, I
feel that Jon has done an excellent
job as SGA president and deserves
recognition for this,

FURTHERMORE, I am
outraged at Bob’s attempt to
characterize Jon as reactionary
and himself as progressive. He
does not know the meaning of the
word progressive. Bob has at-
tempted, in classic reactionary
style, to cloud the issues, to distort
reality, and to paint himself as
progressive. Hopefully, the
campus will not allow him to
succeed. lf Norris Hall is any in-
dication, ll. has not since Norris
just defeated Bob in his attempt to
be reelected to SGA. Perhaps SGA
can accomplish more now that it
will no longer have to put up with
Bob, Jim Stuart

What have you done, Dave?

To the editor: To Dave McConnell:
Good Christ, Dave, what have you

 

done? I know it‘s important to save
money, and increasing the ef-
ficiency of the Forum Grill would
surely serve this purpose. But the,
monstrous uglification which
occurred over break can hardly be
justified in any terms,

"lot only did it no doubt cost a
buck, but it destroys the spacious,
open quality which was one of the
Grill's best facets. I feel I am
sitting on a beach in German oc-
cupied France Shortly before D-
day as I innocently eat my
cheeseburger,

Tile Women who work back there
don’t care much for being encaged
either Please write us a letter:
explaining your intentions. Is it
possible that the bunkers might be
removed and the peaceful, even'

friendly atmosphere of the forum
grill be restored? Colin Sacks and
Dan Ward

No “Forum”

To the editor: That was a nice
article in last week's'sna but Doug
Schultz who Wrote the article about
me called me “Forum Dave." Ido
nol. like to be called that anymore,
but that's water over the dam.

I am getting along a good deal
better. I have been here a week
now this afternoon. since I spent
about 11 days in Grinnell Hospital.
I will see Dr, Carney in anolher
week. I have lost weight College
students come down to see me
when they have time.

Keep up the good Work. Your
Friend. David J. Mallnck
