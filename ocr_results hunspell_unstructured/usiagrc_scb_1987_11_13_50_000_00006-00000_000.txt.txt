In tlle open Forum the phrase
“intellectual masturbation" was
used in reference to intellectunls’
overuse of discussion. It occurs
to me that perhaps a more ap-

rationalization is as “intellectual

Woman tells of

hostility

towards inter—racial Couple

To the Editor:

In the time since the Speakeasy,
there has been much discussion on,
and analysis or, raclsm at Grln-
hell. Yes, there is a problem at
Grinnell and something must be
done about IL Analyzing the pro-
blem only goes so far, education
and action must take over from
there. But one important lesson I
learned Irom the Speakeasy was
that racism must not be ignored.
To be silent about it is to give
.power over you and allows it to
continue. Although I'm a private
person. I now ieel it's necessary
to speak out on the racism I've ex~
perienced, because it's time tor it
to stop

As a white woman engaged to a
black man, I have experienced
racial hostility from both blacks
and whites. The issue of inter-
racial relationships is one shroud-
ed in ignorance and tear. Like
other prejudices. people iear what
they do not know or what is dil-
iereni Irum them. They react with
hostility that is not always
maniiested as open hostility, but
mostly as underlying tension and
disapproval. l have had to deal
with comments and assumptions
from some whites who attempt to
belittle me. my character, my
boyiriend. and my relationship
It's been assumed that l have a
”thing tor black guys,” From
blacks, I've felt hostility and disapr
pruval I have been hurt, attended,
and bewildered by these ex.

perlences, The hostility has been
hard to confront at times because
lt's so subtle. Yet, [still feel it.

But there is absolutely no excuse
ior it. The stereotypes oi interr
racial relationships as not right or
inherently supcriicial are wrong, i
am dlsgusted that i have felt
pressures to justiiy my relation
ship. Intrarracia] relationships are
not subjected to that. I can speak
only lrom my own experience. but
this relationship has been the
most special and educational ex-
perience oi my lite, and cannot be
dismissed by those too alraid or
dealing with it

I ask that blacks, as well as
whites, not delinc MY reality
because you Just. don't know what
it is, We are more than just "black
and white," we are varying shades
oi gray. I do not Icrcc him to lure
sake his blackness because it is dif-
ferent Irom my whiteness. I would
be denying him his right to dignity
as a human being. We respect our
differences and learn from them,
not in spite of them. It is the
responsibility oi every person to
educate himself or hersell. black
as well as white. Both groups must
stop judging the other on the basis
of stereotypes. These racist
judgments erect barriers and cripr
ple the human potential pi both
blacks and whites. Change
becomes possible only when the
judgments stop. _ noun-a .

some people have an unreasonable

To the Editor:

Something was brought to my at

disturbing to me, When I went to
work at the Sundance Lounge, the
bar manager there told me or a

been out there the previous
Wednesday. bowling. and smoking
marijuana, I could not believe
what he was telling me. They were
actually sitting m the alley with a
lit joint, passing it around. Fore
tunately ipr them, he did not call
the police, but told them to put it
out. They thought it was OK since
there wasn't anyone else there.

Senator
defends
Joint Board

To the Editor:

I take exception to last week’s

missive concerning the way the
Cabinet runs SGA meetings. The
letter writer expresses the opinion
that the Cabinet tries to rush things
past the senators. However, I have
attended almost every Joint Board
meeting, and before every
substantial vote either the presie
dent or the parliamentarian will
state clearly exactly what is being
voted on. I do not think that any
senator's failure to understand the
subject at a vote is necessarily the
Cabinet's fault.
The letter writer also says that a
section of the Judicial Council
Bylaws and a Committee on stu-
dent Lile proposal concerning
alcohol and searches at athletic
events at Darby were being rushed
before the senators. However, the
senators had received copies oi
both matters at least two days and
in some cases a week before votes
were taken on the subjects, This, I
believe. is supported by the tact
that amendments to the subjects
were brought up and discussed at
great length. The writer seems to
confuse his personal opposition to
the proposals with a iailure ol,the
parliamentary system. I sat
through the entire debates on both
proposals and both proponents and
opponents oi the amendments had
ample opportunity to air their
Views. I agree with the letter
writer that more people should at

don't think the rest oi his letter has
