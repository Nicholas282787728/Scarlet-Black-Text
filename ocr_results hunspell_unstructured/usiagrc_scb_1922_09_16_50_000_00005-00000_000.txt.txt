Which Type of Research

is of Greatest Value?

A stove burns too much coal. A man familiar with the princi-
ples of combustion and heat radiation makes experiments which
indicate desirable changes in design. That is research.

guishable by any test from the natural stone. You begin by
analyzing rubies chemically and physically.

Pat paid seven dollars and a. half
for a. pig last (all. He fed it all
winter, spending twelve dollars for
feed, and sold it in the spring for

“Well Pat," said a neighbor, "you
didn’t make much, did you?"

"No," said Pat, “but I had the use of
the pig all‘ winter."

While melting up your chemicals and experimenting with high
temperatures, you begin to wonder how hot the earth must
have been millions of years ago, and what: were the forces at play
that made this planet what it is. Your investigation leads you
far from rubies and causes you to formulate theories to explain
how the earth, how the whole solar system was created. That
would be research of a still different type.

Research of all three types is conducted in the laboratories of
the General Electric Company. But it is the third typHpio-
neering into the unknown—that means most in the long run,
even though undertaken with no practical beneﬁt in View.

For example, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec-
tric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order'to dis-
cover not only how the atoms in different substances are
arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more
you know about a substance, the more you can do with it.
This work may enable scientists to answer more deﬁnitely the
question: Why is iron magnetic? Then the electrical industry
will take a greater step forward than can be made in a century
of experimenting with existing electrical apparatus.

You can add wings and stories to an old house. But: to build a
new house, you must begin with the foundation.

lReviews by Boston Post and. San
Francisco Chronicle Seem to
Be Favorable.

Returning students were sn'prised
by seeing on the hoekstands this fall
a volume entitled “Corn: Moods From
Mid-America." by Harold N, Swanson,
'23. With art board covers and a.
decorated jacket this volume is price
ed at one dollar and seems to have
had a remarkably good sale, tor the
second edition is now on the presses.

Reviewers of this collection of
“Moods" seen: to have understood
ethat the author was aiming at ideas
lexpressed iu the Japenese llokkn
form, not the current lree verse. The
Boston Post and the San Francisco
Chronicle. in recent comment, spoke
of this unique form and stated that it
was "not done atter Sandburg.” The
maiority of the book is reprinted
rrom "Verse and Fiction” and various
national literary magazines.

The title of the book is l'zttllel- mis<
leading (or the section dealing with
the Middle West is subordinated to

.the two themes which monopolize the

bookanature and women. It 'is
understood that a collecuon of Swan»
son's short stories will be isued next
spring by an eastern publisher under
the title, [This Love Business."

"Who belongs to the Army on de

you belong to the Navy."
