Big bats and nine pitchers

Pioneers look forward to strong offense and defense

BYJOHNNY Buse

As snow slowly melts and sunlight re-
turns, patches of green begin to show themv
selves on baseball diamonds across the Mid
west, To many, the month of March brings
much more than warm weather and longer
days; with spring comes the crack of bats,
smell of leather gloves and yells of umpires.
Baseball is here.

The undisputed pastime of American
sports, baseball has returned to Grinnell for
the 2008 season. With the new year comes
veterans and rookies who plan to go further
than before under the head coaching ofTirn
Hollibaugh. “We’re gonna be very damn
dangerous this year,"said pitcher Gary l<ahn
'09.

The Pioneers enter the
year with “the most exper
rienee that I've seen in
my time here," said Hols
libaugh. "Realistically, the
expectations are high."

Returning from last
year are seven starters,
three ofwhom are seniors,
as well as nine pitchers who have pitched in
college baseball games,

There are some worries as to the “smaller
than usual freshman elass,"said Kahn. With
only three freshmen after what Hollibaugh
called a "tough admissions year," the weight
of the team rests largely on returning play-
ers.

Even though their numbers are slnall, the
team values the first—year class, “The team‘s
very impressed with their work ethic." said
Kahn. “They come in every day, keep their
mouths shut and get their work donc,"

Only one starting position player from
last year graduated, setting Grinnell's of-
fcnse up as an extreme threat to opposing
teams. Hollibaugh points to Brett Maloney
’09, Ryan Fletcher ’11, and a quickly im-

grabs
”[lhe ﬁrsteyears] come in
every day, keep [her/mouths

shut and gel iherr work done.”

proving Paden Roder '10, as explosive bats
in the lineup so far this season. Other key
points in Grinnell’s offense include Robbie
Unsell ’08 and Chad Takabuki ’10, who each
hit over .350 last season.

But beyond the powerful offense and
solid defense, the pitching leaves a few ques
tions to be answered. “We are going to go as
far as our pitching staff," said Hollibaugh.

With nine pitchers on their roster. the
Pioneers depth in pitching is one of the
teams' strongest points. However, the team
lacks an ace to rotate around in past ycarSr
the starting rotation has been cemented by
a few regular starting pitchers. This year,
spots are much more uncertain and up {or

“We've got depth,
we’ve got talent, it's just
a matter of whether they
can compete this year,"
said Hollibaugh, While
more than enough pitchr
crs are available to ﬁll
starting and relief posi-
tions, a clear go-to pitcher
has yet to be established.

The pitchers see their importance in
putting the offense into optimal positions.
“We've just got to get up there and pound
the strike zone." said Kalin

With an undefeated reeord indoors so
far. a tough schedule sits ahead of the Pros
necrs. The team opens with a double header
against st. Olaf who was nationally ranked
at 19. The teams in the Midwest Confer:
ence are strong year after year, but the team
is hopeful and “not giving any team too
much credit," said Kahn.

With such a tough schedule and heated
rivalries between conference teams. there
are undoubtedly plenty of intense games in
store for Grinnell baseball and its fans this
season.

Last Saturday, the Midwest Conference Indoor Championships took place
at Illinois College in Jacksonville, lllinois 0n the men's side, Grinnell College
finished sixth wrth so points, while the women ended up being fourth with 44
points. “We got fourth, which I think is better than we‘ve done before, so that’s
great," said Allison Louthan '08. “We weren't even focusing that much on indoor
Conference"

With the blistering cold of the Midwest preventing track and field from
occurring in the great outdoors, the team went indoors for competition, The
essential focus of Grinnell’s indoor track dc field teams was to prepare for the
outdoor season and the outdoor conference championship. “Our focus is to to
tally be prepared for the outdoors,” said Coach Will Freeman. “May 9 and 10
is our goal,"

The team started the indoor season three weeks later than the other colleges
in the conference and thus did not focus on capturing any titles on the indoor
track. with Grinnell not competing in many ofits stronger events, it was unr
dcrstandable that they did not finish well overall. “We pick up events that we are
very good at including the 10k, the Steeple, and the Javelin,"said Freeman “We
are clearly an outdoor team."

There were some bright spots, however, in the individual competitions that
were taking place. On the women’s side, Louthan finished second in the 3000-
meter run with a time of10:27.06,Anna Gilbert '09 was fourth in the pole \mult
with a leap of2,ss meters.

For the men, garnering a fifth place flnish was the 4x400 relay team of
Fernando Jenkins '10, Dennis Hermann '11, Michael Hargadine '09, and Kyle
Lynch»I(larup '10. “1 was very pleased with the development of the 4x400 inn
doors," said Freeman. “Even though we had done little or no long sprint work
prior to the conference meet.”

With Grinnell not competing in many events, some or the best parts ofthc
team were unable to be showcased.The men will be bringing back four of the
top Six javelin throwers in the conference along with the three (arguably) best
steeple chasers. This is just a glimpse into what should be a very exciting out—
door track and field season,

“I absolutely believe the success of the indoor track season will inevitably
lead to success in the outdoor season," said Jenkins, "I believe that the indoor
season is the foundation ofthe success in the outdoor season."
