6:47 pm
Psyche-up ior tonight's lM volleyball
game begins. Pre-game meal of pb+j
sandwich and mashed potatoes did little to
get me in the mood, so I turn on “Psycho
Killer“ and peal out some mean riils on
my airrguitar..l‘ve got my “1" shirt on as
an ego boost (but I'm reminded at an Iowa
TV station's slogan that “We're more than
number 1, we're the best," You figure it
out).
5:51 ‘
Trek over to the PEG with fellow
Lanaganitos. The air is full of expectancy;
the ground is lull or mud. l silently hope
that I don't slip on the court and make a
fool out of myself. Fellow teammates and I
exchange expressions of confidence. Grier
Patterson declares that to Win we must
”set up my awesome spiking." l-le's 5'5"
or 7'2" or something, so I nod in agree-
ment. Another teammate remarks, “I
hope we win." 1 just hope 1 don't embars
rass myself, ,
6:56
We’re here, My emotions are stirred.
Adrenaline starts to flow, chest expands, a
lump rises in my throat. What if i play hora
ribly'.’ What if we lose because of me?
What if everyone points at me and
whispers aiter i make a bad play? Why
don’t I have a paper due tomorrow so l can
go home? Nah, l'll stick it out. Gulp,
6:58
Oh, the thrill of practice serves! Embar-
rassing, though, it you can't even get your
serves over the net beiore the game,
Nicole I-Iamon, Foreign Student Adviser,
has a slight problem with her serves so she
heads to the sidelines to work them out. “I
have to be more mean," she says to no one
in particular, commenting that the
. Langanites look mean. Come on, we're not
mean, we just came to Wln. And we will.

Grinnell College's Dave Cooke qualiﬁed
tor the NCAA Division III national cham
pionshp cross country meet by placmg
sixth at the Midwest Regional race held
last Saturday. The national championships
will be contested over a livermlle course at
Kenosha, Wis., tomorrow Carthage Cola
lege will host the event,

The first Pioneer to earn a trip to the na
tionals since regional qualiiying meets
were established, Cooke ran a 249111 race
over Augustana's iivemile course in Rock
island; Ill. Cooke's 24:41.1 clocking was a
new Grinnell College cross country record
for iive miles, He also authored a Grinnell
four-mile mark oi 19:51 on his way to the
iivemiie standard.

Well, maybe, i think, as big RA Kino Ruth
enters the gym. Darn, 1 wish l had apaper
due.
6:59
No Stuarts, Mensinger (an RA) and
McKee (Langan SA), stop by to offer pre-
game comments. McKee diplomatically
remarks, “I'm looking toward to playing
the fine people oi our college administra—
tion." Then, as Mensinger walks away,
McKee adds. “I‘m hoping not necessarily
to win the game but to hurt them physical-
ly as much as possible," Maybe Hamon
was right. , . , ,
7:05
We were shaky the first few minutes of
practice but now we're looking pretty
good. Denise Walters, ﬁle referee, ex-
plains the rules; what we can and Can't do,
what she’ll call and what she won‘t. 0h,
great. Now when the ball comes toward
me I not only have to worry about missing
it and having it hit me in the head or hitting
it off into space somewhere, i also have to
worry about violations.
7. 7 ‘
Patterson's first spike slams into the
back wall, 50 [eel away. Chris Murner, on
the sidelines, calls it a grounds rule dour
ble.
7:27
We‘re winning, 13-3, My turn to serve. l
pull my socks up, wipe my brow, take a
deep breath and pray. The serve ilies over
the net and falls between two Students AL
(airs teammates. lam ecstatic but have to
keep my Cool, “Game point," I think to
myseli. Student Affairs calls time out. Ops
posing teams do that to basketball players
beiore they attempt the gamewinning free
throw to make the player think about it. it
works. I'm scared to death.

I let loose and serve. My whole life
ilashes beiore my eyes, The ball is returns

Langan’s Grier Patterson leaps high in
an attempt to block a shot by Student

teammate Paul Eppcn spikes the ball and
we Win. I am in shock. We won, 158. I

volleyball.

The second game begins, I am iirst to
serve. Minutes ago, with the game on the
line I responded to the Challenges and was
the hero lat least in my own mind). Now,
with the pressure off, I'm confident, The
serve is a vicious one, but unfortunately it
goes straight into the net. Back to reality.
