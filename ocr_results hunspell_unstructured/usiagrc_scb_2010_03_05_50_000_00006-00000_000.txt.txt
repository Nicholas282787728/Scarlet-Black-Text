Tree house unfurls red
carpet, admission limited

BY COURTNEY SHEEHAN

An Academy Awardewmning director once
proclaimed the Oscars to be “the greatest pmmOr
tion scheme that any industry ever devised for its
sel.f."The idea of the good people of Hollywood
ooncoeung an evenr for their own self-nggran-
dizrement is...not surprising. But take a moment
to consider the surprising number of similarities
between the Oscars and another grand old time
neared by and for a particular grourrhe tree
house dub of childhood (here I am referring to
the mythic ideal oftree houses found in pop Cul-
ture of the last several decades, not to any actual
experiences you may have had).Think about it—
as a kid, when you wanted to become a member
of the most elite ofclubs~the kind of club where
business was co'ﬁHiicted in a tree house~you had
to ﬁllﬁll some su'H criteria ﬁrst. To start with, as
a rule gender matters. Just recall the ubiquity of
NO GIRLS (0: BOYS) ALLOWED signs in
the narratives of our youth, whether in Nickel-
odeon shows, movies or the neighbor’s backyard.
Once you managed to be the right gendetyou got
to scuttle up a tree and learn the l domain’s
secret password. Life in the club was dictated by
arbitxary but exuemely important rules.The rules
of the club were often documented and may or
may not have involved spending a night alone in
a haunted house.

The osons share an unranny resemblance to
this picture of scabbyvkneed IOeyeareolds peak
ing through makeshift penscopes and tirade
ing against imagined foes. To start With, gender
matters. You better be doing it right, especially
ifyou hope to show your face on the red car-pet
or compete for an acting award. NO GENDER
TROUBLERS ALLOWED. The secret pass-
word changer every year, appearing in the form of
an invitation to attend the big event'l‘his gives cc,
lebs access to the red carpet.When the club meets
irrg is about to begin, they clamor over each other
into the Kodak Theatre, a tree house for glama—
zons rfever there was one. Aloft and glorious, club
members must adhere to a whole lot of bizarre
rules. Let’s take a look at a few of my favorites,
courtesy ofWikipedia:

1)“Neithet winners nor their heirs may sell the
slamel‘tes without ﬁrst offering to sell them bad(
to rhe Academy for US sl. lfa winner rehrses to
agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps
the statuerte."

2)“A ﬁlrn must be feanirerlength, deﬁned as
a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subs
lect alst and it must exist either on a 35 mm or

3)At any point, winners may be cut oﬁr mid-
sentence during acceptance speeches with the
woke of the conductor’s Wand. The chances of
this happening increase if the winner's aecomr
plishment is merely technical (editing, cinematog-
raphy) or ifhis/her accent isn'tAmei-icrm.

4) “Reluctant at ﬁrst, [Mexican ﬁlm director
Emilio “El lndio"] Fernandez was ﬁnally cone
vinced to pose nude to create what today is known
as the “Oscar.”

While the last may not look like a rule at ﬁrst

ce, it was nonetheless a foundational condi—
tion for the development of the club—the rule of
Othering. In fact, let's take a look at some of the
othenng that's going down at this year’s Oscars.
It’s no big spoiler to say that “Avatar”will prob
ably win Best Picrure. A lor or people dig this
movie—and audimces are certainly entitled to
enjoy a thinly veiled white guilt-ridden, sﬂdst
warmongering cash oow under the guise orposr-
walmarr environmentalismil will merely judge
them for doing so. Another best pic nom, “The
Blind Side,” tells the equally embarrassing tale of
a rich white lady taking a poor black boy under
her wing, showing him the road to success in the
white world. Bottom line,agenuine social u-iti'que
like“Disnict 9"will notwin. How about the direc-
tor’s mtegory? Kathryn Bigelow is set to beat her
ex James Cameron, scoring a big one for women
ﬁlmmakers. But there’s still the issue that in the
year 2010, when bladt director Lee Daniels found
out he was nominated for best director, he ex-
claimed, “It was crazy, oﬂithevhook, insane." His
disbelief at the very thought of receiving a nomie
nation indicates that he knows he won't win, but
perhaps he’ll be comforted when Morgan Free
man takes the Best Actor award for his pornayal
of Nelson Mandela in “lnvictus,” aka. “Remem-
bet the Titans 2."

No wonder George C. scott who won Best
Actor in 1970 for Patton refused to accept his
award. "lire whole thing is a goddamn meat par
rade.I don’t want any part ofit."Maybe the biggest
difference between the Oscars and the tree house
is that when kids dimh back down from the tree
at the end ofa sun-soaked afternoon, they leave
the world ofpretend behind them and prepare to
tuck in to dinner and homework In Hollywood,
the mar parade never ends,
