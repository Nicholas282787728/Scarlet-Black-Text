{Large Class Causes Room

By Marc Breindel

An unexpected increase in
freshman enrollment has cons
tributed to a temporary housing
shortage this semester. but the
college administration says the
problem should be alleviated
within two to three weeks.

A low attrition rate and the dos
ing or all-campus housing
facilities are also factors in a
room crunch which has forced
some students to live in lounge
areas temporarily.

As freshman class size has been

small {or the last two years, cams
pus officials did not anticipate the
14 percent increase over last
year's enrollment.

The new students may have
been attracted by Grinnell’s Conn
centrated recruiting in lowa,
which drew in is more lowans
than last year. President Drake
added optimistically. “And
maybe we're doing a lew other
things right."

Other reason s (oi the housms
problem are that Pine 'l'ree
has been closed lor remodeling,

and 1217 Park Street House is now
an Anthropology Building. These
buildings formerly housed 30

live in off-campus housing. and 10
more will soon join them.

Some underclassmen are

Their main complaint seems to be

echoes the general sentiment:
“This is deﬁnitely a step down
lrom his prospective room, but
it's all right. “I think we've got
more floor space than they do.” he
said. Remelius also thinks the
room is cooler than most, the loca-
tion is good, and “it‘s going to be a
hassle moving."

The North Lounge in South

ed back into a computer room;
