HATS OFF TO THE COUNCIL

Last night the Student Council again
showed its leal merit by declining to adopt the
proposed plan for a highly centralized banking
and auditing system. In doing this the mem-
bers of the Council showed themselves to be
true representatives of the students.

Realizing that the first proposal was not at
all what the students wanted, the Council
wisely decided to appoint zl committee to (iron
up s new plan or to levise the old arrangement.
Thus a sincere and honest effort is being made
to meet the problems of the students and to
really serve a useful purpose,

This action is not the only wise move that
the Council has made, and the action of that
body since tolling office last spring has cer-
tainly merited the warmest praise. We say
hats off to the (‘rrinnell Student Council, for the
present group has really shown what student
government can mean. ,

HOW ABOUT SOME PEP?

During the past few weeks the members
of the Student Council pep committee have
been striving to stir the Grinnell student body
out of its lethargy.

However, the results have been for from
encouraging No interest has been shown. (lee
spite the earnest efforts of the pop chairmen,
and soon the carping critics will be hunting
for someone‘s scalp because of the luck of pop.

This lack is not the fault of the pep l‘lmll‘r
men, but is nothing but an indication of the at-
titude. of the student. There seems to be no in-
terest in cheering. This is indeed a sorry ale
and the Homecomers will be in for it sorry time
if something is not done.

Plans are underway for a real pop celebra-
tion for Homecoming and the only way that
they will be a real Succ‘tss is for the student
body to get behind and reillly put the pep plan
over.

Come on, how about some pep?

COLLEGE IS LIFE
(Daily 0 Collegian)

“College is not it preparation for life; it is life
itself. The day by day choices you will make here
are quite as important, if not more so, than those
you will have to make later." These are the words
of Harold Willis Dodds, president of Princeton
university. in his first address to the student body
this fall.

President Dodds' statement is correct. Parents
often think of their children in college as having
nothing really difficult or strenuous to do, and no
responsibilities to shoulder.

Many times do we hear the statement: “Wsit
until you are out in the world and then you will
know how hard things really are." We do not
doubt the authenticity of this statement but we do
wish to disprove the popular conception that college
is a bed of oses with more play than work.

One professor on this campus each semester
makes the joke in some of classes that "college
is o bed of roses with more plsy than work.
of students." It may be a winter resort for the
few who have money in sufficient quantities to sup
ply their needs and desires but it is certainly no
resort for the 1,000 students enrolled in this instir
tution that mlust earn all or part of their. way
through school in addiion to keeping up their school
work.

A student in college is shouldered with the
problem of keeping up school work; and the teachers
plan their courses with the idea of keeping the
student busy. In addition to keeping busy, scholas-
ticslly speaking, the average student is at the age
of life where dances, dates, sports, and other forms
of recreation are most uppealing to him. He
usually gives p great share of life to this phase of
activity. And in addition to school work and
social life comes labor for a living to a great many7
approximately one-third of the students in college.
And many students hold honorsry positions in- or-
ganlzations and fraternities that require much time.

The farmer quits work at sundown. The ordir
nary business man leaves his office or place of
business at four. five or Six o‘clock each day. But
the college student goes all the timeizt all hours
of the night. He comes in from a dance at mid-
night oh Friday night and ammo for is Saturday
morning exsm. Foolish, one might say, yet it is nec«
essary if the student wishes to keep up the work
which he is assigned and must do and the pleasure
which he desires.

College is certainly life in that one must each
day make important decisions that may be vital to
The student lives in a community with

self congenial to others. The student must adapt
himself to his environment as much as he must
adapt himself to meet conditions in later life.

Glancing Back

40 Years Ago

"The Institute meeting last sht-
alturday evening very seriously felt
the effect of the athletic spirit of
the season and the republican rally
which was in progress that cven~
ing, and while the program rend-
ered was a very creditable one,
there were“ few present to receive
it and enjoy it.”

“A pleasant company of about so
students enjoyed a sturllght ride
Saturday evening. At the close
of the ride the party was invited
in by’ Miss Beyer . . . Before der
parting the guests indulged in the
always delightful Virginia Reel.
At :1 sessonable hour the hostess
was hidden good night after an cv.

Harold Matthews '16. and Lois

“A pep meeting which defied all

rooters gathered in the Men’s
gymnasium at 11 o'clock.”

Cottage five was occupied for

servations for guests during
Homecoming in both the dormiA
tory and quadrangle dining rooms

and through dinner on Sunday. '.

In order to ovoid an overflow,
reservations must be limited and
will be taken in order of applica-
tion. Call Miss Smith's office

and Mrs Hopper at the dormitory
kitchen for reservations at the

COLLEGIATE REVIEW

John Germ is interested in bac-
teriology. He's written Ohio State
university for information relative
to a course in that subject.

Columbia university will receive
a cash bequest of 325.000 to be
used “to found as many' Scholar-
ships as it will in the schools of ap—
plied Science" under the terms of
the will of one of its graduates,
Dr. Frank Vanderpoel of East
Orange, N. J., who died last month.

Japan will have an opportunity
to see American football this
autumn. A Squad of 34 former
college players, from Tulsa univer-
sity, the University of Chicago and
various Pacific Coast schools will
play a series of ten games in seven
Japanese cities.
