THE COMING DUAL WITH IOWA.

Next Saturday afternoon ath-
letic relations with the State Uni
versity will be resumed. Grinncll
will meetthe University on Iowa
Field in the First dual tracl: meet
since rgoo. A fast contest is ex-
pected. Little is known of the
real merits of the university team
except that the trainer and men
have been “sawing wood" and
saying nothing. From all that
can be learned, it is thought that
Grinnell has a ﬁghting chance to
winthemeetnextSaturday,though
rumors of darltthorses on the Ioiva
City team may be well founded
and surprises will no doubt be
plentiful.

In the dashes. Scarr, McCoy and
Anderson are good men and if
White runs he will certainly be a
point winner. In the distances,
little is known ofthe Iowa runners
as no records have been given out
and the home meet last Saturday
wasstopped by rain before thetwo
milewasrunoff. Theweightsand
pole vault must be conceded to the
Iotva team, though if the hammer
throw record of 95 feet, given out
at the home meet, is correct,
Grinnell may win a place in that
event, Weinrich. the Burlington
high school pole vaulter, issaiti to
he doing eleven feet. in the
broad jump, Ross should win, as
he has a record of 22 feet, 3 inches
and is said to be jumping 22 feet
thisyear. Barkerhasdones feet,
9 inches in the high jump and
should win that event. In the
hurdles,Andcrson should win both,
with Bair second, and third a pos-
sibility for either school. The re-
lays may go to either school with
the chances in favor of Iowa in the
halfrmile and Grinnell in the long-
cr race. Anderson.McCoy,VVhite
and Scarr should run the halfrnlile
relayin r:35andthe Grinnclltcam
cannot do betterthan 1:36. In the
mile relay, with Trigg out on ac-
count of a bad anltlc, the chances
are not asbright as before, butthc
team can probably loner last Satr
tlrday's accord by a few seconds.
The university has some strong
men whose records are known,
and may produce others. Captain
Anderson is said to be running
both hurdles in state record time,
and Saturday did the 220 in 23
seconds, which is the best time

 

ntadebyanlowasprtntcrthisycar
Crane is a winner in the shot put
with a record of 38 feet. 8 inches.
and Swift has the Western Inter»
collegiate record in the discus at
118 feet, 9 inches. These mcn,
with Ross, Weinrich and Barker,
seem to be able to win seven ﬁrsts
and decide the meet, but propher
stes do not amount to much based
upon Comparativc records,
Certainly the meet will ber‘i fast
one and will not be a foregone
victory for either team. The
Grinnell men are in first class con—
dition and will go to Iowa City
capable of doing almost their
best work. A large crowd will
accompany the Scarlet and Black
team and help them put up the
best light possible. The day at
Iowa City will be well ﬁlledr In
the morning Amos and S. U. I.
will play a league baseball game,
in the afternoon will occur the
dual meet, and in the evening a
large symphony orchestra will
give a concert, All who intend to
accompany the team should sign
up at once at Rust’s or Alley’s,
If a large enough number of sign
natures is obtained, a special train

will be secured, to get tolowa City r ‘

before the ball game and to leave
immediately after the concert in
the evening.
