After six years or iaithiul service to
IowaCollege, Professor ii. L. Smith
or the School or Music resigned his
position during July and accepted the
Directorship oi the School of Music ol
Lawrence University at Appleton,
Wisconsin. .

Professor Smith came to Iowa Col-
lege in isolasinstrucwr in pianciorte.
He held this position until 1904
when he assumed the additional
burden oi Director or the School oi
Music.

Mr. Smith did much in the six years
he was in Grinnell to promote the in—
mresrs of the School or Music and
the college in general. ilewas a man
or exmptional musical ability besides
possessing a broad training which
made his ideas valuable along other
lines As a pianist Mr. Smith was at
his best and his thorough sympathy
and interpretation ofthe compositions
eithe’greati composers oiten delight
on his audiences. To the eiIorts of
Mr. Smith in'orelhan any other per»
son is due the success and wide reputa
tion or the Iowa College lllee Club.
Mr and Mrs. Smith will be missed in
College social circles but their irienrls
remote in the good position that
awaits iilrn in Lawrence i‘nirersity.

In beginning the new year, the
management wishes to state that they
