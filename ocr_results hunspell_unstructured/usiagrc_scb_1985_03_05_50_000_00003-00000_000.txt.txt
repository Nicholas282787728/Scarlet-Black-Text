McConnell sends “Facts” about union to workers

by Todd Eu
Quasllic

On January 30. the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRBl approved cola
lege tood service workers' application
to hold a union vote. A month later.
Food Service Director Dave McConnell
mailed notice of the election dale and
procedures to the workers, Attached to
this notice was a memo Irom McCon~
hell.

The memo concluded. “In a collec»
tive bargaining situation the only re-
quirement oi the College is to bargain in
good iaith. it a union makes bargaining
demands that an employer cannot
satisfy. the union has three choices:

1. STRIKE —- in which case the
striker can be permanently replaced.

2, AGREE WITH THE
EMPLOYER'S POSITION ~ in which
case the workers will have accomplish-
ed nothing.

3. ABANDON THE EMPLOYEES 7
in which case the workers will have
spent their dues for nothing.

in a collective bargaining situation
there is only one guarantee - it you
belong to the union. you will pay dues.
These are facts you need to consider."

McConnell argued against six
“Points” in the unsigned letter which
supported unionization. McConnell
characterizes his statements as “facts
as compared to the innuendo suggested
in the [unsigned] lettter."

First, McConnell tried to refute the
contention that there was no good
understanding concerning wages and
beneiits between management and
labor by making reference to regular
menu meetings held within the opera-
tion. He added that “If an ideal situa-
tion means having regular employ-
ment, without layolls. we have it If it
means having a grievance procedlire.
then you have it."

Currently, it a worker has a
grievance with McConnell, that worker
can petition Vice President Waldo
Walker. The ultimate arbiter in a
grievance procedure is President
George Drake. Food service workers
employed by Iowa state educational ins
stitutions arid unionized food service
workers in some private institutions all
have recourse to arbitration pro
cedures.

Grinnell's procedures are outlined in
the Food Service employees handbook.
Some workers who have been working
with the college {or years still do not
possess this handbook. though one was
to be posted on kitchen bulletin boards.

The second point of contention was as
to whether Food Service wages have

Perry anti Robert 0.

kept pace with those paid to employees
01 the Physical Plant. McConnell Cites
an 3.53 mrcent average increase in
wages tor iood service and a 7.24 per
‘cent across the board increase for
Physical Plant workers. The minimum
pay for a Physical Plant worker is six
dollars an hour tojust above six dollars
an hour.

The third point was as to whether
management has determined the
rights. work schedules or morale oi
food service workers. McConnell states
that as a necessary part of manage
ment. workers can be "relocated" with
consideration {or stall and personal
needs.

He Justilles this management policy
by citing the College Management
Rights section at the B 8: (5 contract.
This specific clause stipulates that

these rights are “Subject only to the
terms of this Agreement." The College
has no blanket management policy for
other departments on campus.

According to McConnell. manage
ment and employees work at the,
pleasure of the President.

The iourtli point. which McConnell
wrote, “Alludes to the possibility that
your [employees’l wages will be ad
iusted to match those in the physical
plant.” McConnell continued, "I want
to underscore the fact that both the
union and the college must agree belore
a collective bargaining agreement is
signed...l see no reason why we would
compare ourselves to any other groups

Union claims it would
not threaten student jobs

by Todd Perry

SGA President Matt Golden told
students at last week's SGA meeting
that a unionized Grinnell College Food
Service could mean the loss oi student
iood service jobs.

Golden learned or this possibility m a
meeting with President Drake in which
the organizing eitorts of Grinnell Cola
lege Food Service workers was discuss
ed, he said. According to Golden. Drake
made reierence to the unionization 0!

context 01 a possible loss at Food Serr
vice student Jobs.

Most students employed in the {cod
service receive work as part of their
iinacial aid packages.

when asked whether students were
employed by B a u when 3 at G workers

Drake said' that he was not sure it
students were working ior B to G in
1970. He added. however. that students

According to B at G union steward
Doyle Mikles. no students were working
lor the service during the school year
when workers joined Local 90 or when E
a G went on strike in 1974. "i recall that

we did have some student paint crews
in 1953, but {the crews) were faded out
long beiore a o c in the summer monr
ths ior many years though." he added.

Section 3.7 of the B 5: G contract with
the College states that. “Student
employees on work grants are not
Covered by this Agreement, It is intend-
ed that such student employment, or
summer help. will be supplementary
and will not be used [or the purpose of
replacing employees covered by this
Agreement."

Dale Hawn. Director of B k G said
that this clause was added to the con
tract to prevent management from
replacing regular workers with
students. thereby undercutting the
worker’s jobs,

Teamsters Union officials said that if
Food Servtce employees join Local 90.
the union does not intend to push for an
increase in the number of {ullstime
