Student posters vandalized

BY LINN DAVIS

Posters advertising a visit by femiw
nist author Inga Muscio were defaced
and pulled down three weeks ago, highs
lighting a string of poster vandalisms
this semester and over past years.

Muscio, who spoke on Oct. 30 as

art of Feminist Action Coalition's

FAC) annual Love Your Body Week, is
the author of Cums/1 Dec/mullet! oflrlr
ddfemlmm The title ofthe book. which
advocates reclaiming the expletive as a
positive word, appeared prominently on
FAC’s posters.

In the week and a half before the
event, the word “cunt” was blacked out
on posters in ARH and on East Carn-
pus, and it was cut out or posters on
South Campus and the large poster
rn the JRC. On many of the censored
posters, passerseby replaced the word
next to where it had been.

“This doesn’t feel malicious to me;
[rather] it wasjust a person being upset
at the word itself,” said Emma Lawler

Rouccea TAYLOR

'09, a FAC co-lcader.

Connie Coleman,\vho works at the
JRC r-eceptron desk in view ofthe large
poster. sard she found it “very offensive"
and biieﬂy removed the poster before
being told to replace it.

”You can have an opinion, but 1
don't think the wall out here" is a good
place to display it, she said, “You ought
to think about it before you wi'ite it."

FAC leaders said they hoped some-
one would come forward to discuss the
issue With them,

“Obviously we're okay with people
talking to us about it; that’s part of the
reason we put up the pastels,” Lawler
Sﬂldr “Cunt is a hard word for u lot of
people to read."

Sign damage has long attected
many groups on campus and has varred
frorn annoying to frightening.

Lasr Friday. for example, Free the
Planet posters were swiped from the
dorm loom door of coileaders Emily
Kugisaki ’09 and Heidi Conner '09.

Punk outrage on-
the mainstage

BY LAWRENCE SUMULONG

Drrrrng the Monday night rehearsal of Grinnell's
fall mainstage play Roi Dear/r, Flanagan Theater
reveiberated to the sounds of a very appropriate llnT
them. The set, a reproduction of England's Wenrlre
icy football stadium, echoed with Tire Clash’s song
“Death or Glory," beginning with the lyrics, "Now
every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world."
The intense song provides an accurate insightinto the
compromises and pressures that afﬂict the characters
of Alice (Gillian Hemme ’10), Nita (Tosin AlukOr
Olokun ‘09), Phil (Renee Lynch ’08) and Beth (Dale
Mackey’o7).

The plot ofRuI Dl‘lli/J focuses on the lives of four
young women in economically depressed Manchester,
England in 1979. All four are ‘Rcd Dcvils,'ot fervent
supporters of the English Premiership club Man
chester United. The play follows their struggle to get
tickets to attend the Football Association Cup Final,
which pits Manchester United against English rival,
Arsenal. As the play progresses, the characters cone
front one another, by means oteither verbal or physi-
cal abuse, while questioning their individual problems
and feelings ofvulncrability.

range from class relations to unemployment. subtly
addresscs issues that ”we just don’t neeessatrly see
[within] what is referred to as the ‘Grinnell Bubble.”

“I want audiences to see their own world slightly
drfferently when they come out ofa performance from
when they did when they came in." Connolly said.”It
would he really interesting {or Grinnell students to
contemplate a world in which the only way you can
feel like a winner is it’yout athletic team wins ”

In addition to having their personal sets of prob-
lems, the {our characters arc ciisnatcd in an era when
young Btrtons saw their unemployment rate soar to
approximately 40 percent. “Having no opportunie

would consider what [happened] to be
an extremely aggressive ncr.”

In early October, posters for a
StoneCo Coming Out Week art show
were taken off the (loot of the Stone-
wall Resource Center arrd ripped up
on the door, according to SRC Direce
tor Lester Aleman ’07. Posters on East
Campus were also torn clown

This past April, hornophobrc slurs
were written on signs advertising the

assertive and do not take crap from anyone, [which]
is something I hope Grinnell students will appieciate
because it's a very un-Grinnell sort ofchnracter to
have,"

For the four actors. each character’s assertiveness

presented a challenge that went beyond their stoCk
