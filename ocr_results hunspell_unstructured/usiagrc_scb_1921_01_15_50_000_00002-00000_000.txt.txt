THE LIBEIIAL ARTS COLLEGE

Four years ago the universal cry
was “specialize". If the college stud»
en: should go to a college and take
a classical or general course, he was
thought to be committing a. grave
mistake. He was warned against be-
coming a “Jack—al-all-tmdes with
proficiency in none".

Will Lecture in Chapel and High

Prohibition.

Mr. Harry S. Warner. Secretary of
the“ intercollegiate Frdhlbltlnn Asses

crinnell Tuesday, January 13. He
will address the students Tuesday
morning, at Chapel, while he will
speak to the townspeople and all oth—
ers interested Tuesday evening, in the
high school auditorium. His lectures
will deal with phases of the lineman
tlonul prohibition situation.

Mr. Warner has just returned from
Europe where he has been conducting
a course 0: lectures at the various
colleges and universities or England,
He is a keen student of life and is
thoroughly familiar with all sides of
the prohibition situation and is par-

How is a Wireless
Nlessage Received?

{a

VERY incandescent lamp has a nl‘arnent. Mount a metal
plate on a wire in the lamp near the ﬁlament. A current
leaps the space between the ﬁlament and the plate when the

ﬁlament glows.

Edison ﬁrst observed this phenomenon in 1883, Hence it was
called the "Edison effect."

Scientists long studied the “effect" but; they could not explain
it: satisfactorily. Now, after years of experimenting with Crookes
tubes, X-ray tube: and radium, it is known that the current that
leaps across is a stream of "electrons"— exceedingly minute particles
negatively charged with electricity.

These electrons play an important part in wireless communica-
don. When a wire grid is interposed betwcen the ﬁlament and the
plat: and charged positively, the plate is aided in drawing Clemons
Aaron; but when the grid is charged negatively it drive: back the elec—
trons. A very small charge applied to the aid, as small as that re-
cclved from a feeble wireless wave, is enough to vary tho electron
mean. ,

So (h: aid in the tube enables n faint wireless impulu to control
the very much greater amount of energy in the ﬂow of electrons, and
so radio alarm): too weak to be perceived by other means become pan
ceptible by the effect: that they produce. Just as the movement of
I throttle control: a great locomotive in motion, so a Wilde- “VB,
by means of the vid..-ﬁocts the powerful electron strum.

All this followed from studying the mysterious "Edison edict";—
c purely] adenu'ﬁc discovery.

No one can foresee what results will follow from “Search in pure
ximca. Sooner tr later the world must beneﬁt pra‘cticnlly from the
discovery' of new fids. . .

For this reason the Research Laboratories of the Gamma! Electric
Company are concurred as much with investigations in pure science
as they are with the improvement of industrial processes ﬁnd products.
They, tot; have studied the "Edison eﬁcct” scientiﬁcally. The result
has been a new form of electron tube, known as the “pliatran”. a type
of Xﬂw tube free from the vagaries of the old tube; and the "ken:-
tran”, which is callcd by electrical engineers a ”rectiﬁer" because it
has the property of changing an alternating into a direct. current.

All these improvements followed because the Research Labora-
tories try to discover the “how” of things. Pure science always
justiﬁes itself.
