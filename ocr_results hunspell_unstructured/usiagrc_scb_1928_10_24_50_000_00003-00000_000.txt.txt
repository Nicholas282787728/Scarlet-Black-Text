Campus Opinion

Question: Would, you ﬂavor “I ex-
tension of Grinnell’s plant so as to
increase .the student. body to about
Lwice its present. size?

Russell J. Smith: No, because the
advantages we enjoy in a smaller
.school could not be enjoyed in a
school twice our present size.

Lyle Shelmidine: No.
Griu'nell because it was a small col.
lege. Most students come here he.
cause it is small.

' Cornelius Boersrnn: No. because
we would lose the sp 4: of Crinnell.

Leland Cliiford: If it meant a
greater range in the cunlciﬂum, I’d
favor it because some students can.
not take courses they want when
scheduled classes allow for them.

Orrille Sharnborg: No. ‘I think
Grinnell is distinctive now because
of its size. A small'group is the
easiest to work with.

Joe McKee: Yes. With an inv
crease in hex- enrollment Grinnell’s
sphere of inﬂuence would widen.

Kieder Wenger: Yes For a, school
of Grinnells standing, it would add
to its prestige if the present policies
were still in eﬁect. ‘

Dmnld Lamhie: No. Most Stu»
dents come here because it is a small
school. Grinnell would lose its demoe
orntic standard. ‘
