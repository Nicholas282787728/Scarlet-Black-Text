In Midwest Meet

By Wills Davidson

In one of the best wrest-
ling meets in tlle history of .
the Midwest conference, the
Pioneer grapplel's placed
fourth among nine teams
last weekend at Coe college.
A team Coach Bob Peterson
termed as "one of the best I
have ever coached.” won one
vsecond, two thirds, and a fourth '
place,

Carleton won the team title
with as points, followed by
Cornell with El. Coe with 52,
Grinneli with 26, and St Olaf
24; and Ripon, Knox, Monmouth
and Lawrence in that orderr

The tournament was two days
long, beginning on Friday night,
and ending Saturday evening.
Once again Johnny Bohannon
and Marty Hall, two of Coach
Peterson’s most consistent vars
ity performers for the past
three seasons, came through in
fine style to nail down third

places for the Pioneer team.
In the semi-finals of the 1234b.
division Bohannon lost 75 in a
match that could have gone
either way, tn Chuck Green of
Cornell, the eventual gold
medal winner.

In the l47-lb. division Marty
Hall, though losing his prelim-
inary match on the ﬁrst night
of the meet to Nicholson of
Cornell, went on to win two
in a row, and won third place.
Dick Thomas, who placed
third in the championships
two years ago, was able to
place :ourth. losing out to
McCracken M Coe ill a close
battle for third.

Bruce Wilkerson,
heavyweight, and the favoritei
to 'win in his division, was
seriously hampered by an in-
jured ankle, and lost a close
decision to Carleton‘s Macho-i
cek. whom he had defeatedt
earlier in the season. L

Grinnell’s ‘

Other Pioneer wrestlers who
participated in the meet were
Jerry Cooke at 130 pounds,
Larry Froeberg at 147, Wills
Davidson in the‘ 167-111. divis-
ion, John Lane“! at 177, and
Art Grma at 191.

Fl‘oeberg won his first match
by a fall over Messmger of
Ripon, and in the semifinals
lost by only one point, 170, to
Fitch of Cornell, who event-
ually won second place. John
Larew, who up until ten days
before\ the meet was acting
“manager" for the team, came
through with a fall over Knut-
son of St, Olaf in his opening
match, and added some very
valuable points to the Grinnell
team score. Both Cooke and
Grana have been hampered by
injuries all season, and were
not at their peak in this par.
ticular meet.

The defeat of Cornell by
Carleton marked the end of an
era>for the Rams, This Was the
first time in sixteen years that
Cornell has lost the conference
championship, During this per.
iod they also won the National
Collegiate championships (in
1947) and were virtually un-
beatable.
