CAMBRIDGE,MasS.

Despire plans for an unprecedenred growrh of irs
rcscarch programs, rhe Radcliffe insrirure for Advaneed
srudy is quierly slimming
down its central administration
inthcwakcofilsOcL l merger
wirh Harvard Universrry.

in (he pasr four monrhs, ar
lcast rive rop.level adminisrrnr
tors have lift Radcliffc, and of-
ﬁcials say rhey will purposely
nor replace several In hopes of
eliminating jobs now handled
by Harvard.

"In general iwould say rhar
rhe merger wrrh Harvard makes
possible handing over some ofour
work [ro Harvardl,” says Acting Dean
Mary Maples Dunn. "We‘ve already be-
gun somewhar ro reduce some orrhe admin»
isrrarivc cosrs."

For insrancc, rhc merger has made Radcliffc‘s
ofﬁce for undergraduare programming obsolcrca
Harvard is now responsible for all femal: undergradu»
ares.

As rhe Harvard Managemenr Corporarion rakes
eharge chadcliffe‘s newly enlarged $350 m|ll|on en—
dowment, Radclilfc's ﬁnancc ofﬁce also won‘t be quire
as busy.

While Arrnini says (he communicarlons oFﬁee has
merely cxpcricnccd non-mcrgcr relared rurn—over, his

own old job .7 media relarions orheer .. was eliminared
when he was promored ro direeror ofcommunications
rhrs summer.
"The quesrion now is can we eonrinue ro do a grear
iob wirh fewer people?" Armini says. "I rhink we ean.
Maybe rhe days will be a lirrle
bir longer. Bur rhere can be a
benenr ro having a leaner ope

Dunn and Armini borh

Beginning next year, rhe Insti—

rure will supporr so such schol»

ars, eomplere wirh increased reeh-

. Thar means Radcliffe may well be purring

our rhe 'help wanred' sign in earning years.

“My hope is rhar we won'r have ro lay anybody
