EY SHOWS lIlCKIES lEAD AGAIN

Last year a survey of lending college-
throughout the country showed that

smokers in those

colleges preferred

Luckies to any other cigarette.

This year another nation-wide survey
~based on thousands of actual student
interviews, and representative of All
students in regular colleges—shows that
Luckies lead again over all brands, regu-
lar or king size...and by a wide margin!
The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste better.

Smoking enjoyment is all a matter of
E3: and the fact of the matter is Luckies
taste betterrfor 2 reasons. L,S./M.F.T.
~Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacqg. And
Luckies are made better to taste better.
So, Be Happy~Go Lucky!
