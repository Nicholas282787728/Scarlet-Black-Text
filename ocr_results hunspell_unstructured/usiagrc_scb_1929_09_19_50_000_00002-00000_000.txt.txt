ANOTHER WELCOME

The SCARLET AND BLACK has
already sent you its welcome. May
we further extend to you the wishes
of a happy four years. Elsewhere
in this paper opportunities which are
open to all of you are discussed.
Some of you will be Missouri Val<
ley athletes, others will become edi—
tors of Malteasers. Scarlet and
Blacks and Tanagers. All of you
will wear the stamp of the Grinnell-
ian.

There is little advice left to be giv—
en you. Your parents have already
told you to be good students; letters
of congratulation and counsel have
come to you from friends who have
already gone to college; volumes or
catalogues, not only from here out

from many schools, no doubt have
told you what is offered; now you
are actually in this collegiate world.

We will watch you with interest
and, if we may aid you, let us know.

PREPS, BE GOOD.

Every year freshmen have a new
environment to get used to, new
rules to learn, and new customs to
follow. From mother's warning to
“get in early” now there is the quad-
rangle law that all women must be
in by ten on week nights.

Rules may seem rather strict at
first. but when they are compared
with those of other schools, one sees
why Grinnell has a reputation for
progress and leniency. The hours for
girls are longer, freshmen and upper-
classmen have more privileges, such
as dancing and card playing, than
at many places, and the fact that
students have charge of the govern-
ment provides that Grinnell is more
advanced than most schools.

Men are free in large measure to
do as they please. The no prepping
rule of last year has done away with
much of the agony of being a fresh-
man. and new beginning students
have the same privileges as upper
classmen.

The rules of Grinnell have been
made by students for students. They
are not unjust, but extend a helping
hand and offer suggestions to people.
