EUUNUMY Alll] THRIFT UNLY
WAY Tl] GUMBAT H. 6. [IF L.

A campaign of education at check the
orgy of extravagant buying that is
now going on in America is one or the
must serious causes of the inﬂation in
prices will be carried into the schools
this tall by the War Savings Societies.
lVilliztni Mather Lewis, director of the
Savings Division or the Treasury De
partment, has urged all 01' the 6,000,000
members of savings societies through
out the country to work for larger
membership and to show the people
the folly of extravagant buying and
that prices can not be lowered except
by the systematic practice of thrift
and increase of production

Mr. Lewis asserts that the country
is in the midst of a Wild orgy of buy,
ing, and that ztn appalling number oi
people are selling the Liberty Bonds
and other government Securities they
bought by sming and patriotic sacri-

 

lice during the war, and are now in-
dulging themselves in luxuries or all
sorts.

Keep Fir’nl Hold on sittings.

“it is not essential that we return
to the extreme at war econocy.” said
Mr. Lewis. “It is essential, however,
that we keep a ﬁnn hold on the sav-
ings accumulated by purchase of war
ﬁnance securities, not only as a mat-
‘tcr of seltish beneﬁt, but as a factor
in bringing down prices.

“it is absolutely necessary to work
regularly and efﬁciently in order to
produce and distribute the largest
possible volume of commodities and
to exercies reasonable economies in
order that money, goods and services
may be devoted primarily to the liqui—
dation of debt and to the satisfaction.
or the demand for necessities, rather
than indulgence in luxuries. This is
in direct line with the statement or
W. P. G. Harding, Governor or the
Federal Reserve Board, that the chief
solution or the high price problem is
to “work and save."
