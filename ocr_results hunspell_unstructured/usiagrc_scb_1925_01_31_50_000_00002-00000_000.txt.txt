WORLD AFFAIRS

We sincerely appreciate the letter
which appeared in the “What Do You
Think" column last week, suggesting
the introduction of world news into
ihe Scarlet and Black. We are grate-
tul not only for the suggestion but for
the manner in which it is offered. The
Scarlet and Black is a college enter-
prise which is necessarily conducted
by a comparatively small group of
students, Its greatest hope for pro-
gress lies not only in the support, but

“CAMPUS PROBLEMS"

After all, the big job of 'the college
newspaper, as we see it, the one job
for which it alone is responsible, is to
present whatever news interests stu-
dents as students, to present and deal
with matters which are distinctly col-
lege problems, and to keep students in
touch with educational movements as
manifested in other colleges and uni-
versities.

We all have our moments of weari-
nass when the mere phrase “campus
problems” is enough to sickeh us. But
alter all, our interest in the atfairs of,
our campus is a pretty lair test of
our future citizenship, a pretty fai test
of what our interest in the affairs of
our community will he a few years
from now. And the college publication
is the one place where discussion of
campus questions can be given definite
tori-n,

STAIHIhG l’OINl‘

Must ut»us agree that it would he a
very tine thing it each cottage and
building should subscribe to several
good newspapers and keep them in the
parlor or clubroom, Such a plan, as
we have pointed out before, is partic-
ularly needed at the Quadrangle. Even
if the present cottage dues are insuf-
ficient, the additional expense would
mean only a few cents per person. The
only difficulty lies in getting started.

Not long ago a prominent member of
the faculty suggested that Cap and
which
stands for the development of the in-

Gown, as an organization
dividual along both scholastic and ex»
traecni-ricular lmes, is the most logical
group to sponsor such a plan at the
Quadrangle. .

This suggestion seems particularly‘
practical in view of the fact that half
the present members of Cap and Gown
are not only house chairmen but are‘
with the other
house chairmen in their work on the
League board. it Can and Gown should‘

declare itself in lavor of such a mole

closely associated

ment [0 encourage among students an‘
interest in world events. these mem-
bers would no doubt be able to use‘
their personal influence, indirectly, in'
other cottages as well as their own. ,

Among the recent valuable additions
to the st, omt library is a Norwegian
library of' one hundred twenty-four
books donated to the institution by the
late Honorable Knnte Nelson, former

Minnesota farmer. ‘

working conditions have been general-

country the employees themselves
have been given a part in determining
the conditions of their employment.
It is not often that the life-time of
one man has Covered so much of sig-
niiicant accomplishment, and in even
fewer instances has one man been able
to rEndel' so much service and secure
so much progress by his own eflnrts.

It is obvious that these improve~
merits in work and life have an im-
portant bearing on the general wel-
fare, but even inoie direct are the
results of other activities of bombers
and his associates, our system of free
public schools s in a large part the
otrspring of labor initiative; the ex~
tensive and etfective scope ot factory
laws are due to the demands and pe -
sistence of labor; protective legisla~
tion for women and children would
have been only in embryo without the
pressure or labor’s influence; and to
labor must be attributed much credit
for the granting or the electoral tran-
chlse to women,

Amendment Yet‘to all except those
who believe the term "radicalism” to
mean any sort or a hook from the

been an ultra-conservative. He has
steadfastly held his unions to an ac-
ceptance of the principle that perni-

efforts, and those chiefly economic in
