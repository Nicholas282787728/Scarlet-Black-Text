Steals Show at
‘Hellzapoppin’

Spring has evidently hit
crinnell faculty hard.

Mrs. George Hisel', although
not actually listed on the pron
gram, performed the “bllmpsy—
daisy" betore a capacity Shrine
auditorium audience Sunday night.

When she bought her ticket for
"Hellzapoppin," Slapshappy Broad~
way show which played in Des
Moines Sunday, little did Mrs.
I-Iiser realize that she was sign-
ing a contract to be one of the
featured attractions of the pro-
duction.

Chosen at random from the
audience by a clown in the cast,
she exhibited her ability as a
danseuse in the true “Show must
go on" spirit.

The spotlight again fell on Mrs.
Hiser when a hlind-iolded stooge
attempted to guess the true no-
turc of her hat.
