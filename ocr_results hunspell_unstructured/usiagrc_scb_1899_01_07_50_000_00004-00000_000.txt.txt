”Beside US on our light was a
large transport which sailed the
next day with about six thousand
Spanish soldiers. About one
hundred yards almost directly
ahead of us was a mast and other
ruins sticking up out of the water
When we saw tllis we (sit a sensa-

it anger, retenge or just indigna-

The ocean is about two miles and
a halfaway, but looks as though
it weie only threc»qtiarters of a
