GIFTS—NOT JOBS

The administration of the college is to be cone
gratulntcd on its action in ceasing to require time
work from recipients of scholarships. Whether the
decision was made because of the ineffectiveness
of the work done, or from considerations of prin-
ciple, the system need not be tried again.

Students who are receiving scholarships are
usually holding jobs at the some time, and cannot
well spare more time. If they needed money to
pay tuition, they probably need more money to
pay their current expenses, and whatever time
they have for work, they need to be paid tor.

Finally, there is no good to be gained from
confusing jobs with scholarships. There are en-
tirely too many student cmployes already who do
not distinguish clearly between it job and IL gift.
Making gifts into jobs will not clarify the situa-
tion in the least. If a student has timc to work,
let him be given a job. But if a scholarship is de~
aided upon as the best way to encourage superior
college work, and to givc a desirable student the
maximum of assistance, let none of the student’s
time he demanded.

The request for co-opcrotion in creating came
pus spirit and supporting college activities, which
has ostensibly taken the place of the work rc~
quircd, is entirely appropriate. The duties suggest-
ed are what every student owes to his institution.

WHAT PRICE GALLANTRY?

Several Southern California coeds objected to
the proposed 50-50 plan advanced on the campus
there recently with the statement that “Gnllantry
is onc of man’s greatest attractions, without which
the pleasure of his presence is certainly not worth
50 per cent of material expenses involved.” Such
a statement would tend to disprove the success of
womcn’s varsity dances at Grillnell. Coeds hcrc
seem to object not at all.

Many of the women at Southern California
contend that those collegions favoring the plan

could not l)(' cl. fled as “gentlemen,” but listed
them rather as “depression tights.” The Daily
Trojan, studcnt llcwspnpcr there, however, found
the plan at least partially favorable. “It has been
ll noble gesture for tllc men (even though they
are not gcutlclucn),” the paper stated, “to givc
the women it real opportunity to bc collegiate. It
is lnmcutitblc that the stolid coeds hovc i‘ctnlintcd
with their usual sophisticated oils and refuse a
lullfrprirc trip toﬁwhclc you will.”

HAVE WE GOOD MANNERS?

The acquisition of house mothers was it “stop
in the right direction” in regard to bringing a good
influence to bear upon the social graces of the
students of Gl‘l'mlcll college. But their inﬂuence
alone cannot have the results Grillllcllions wish
to see in the general social make-up of the stun
,dcnts unless the latter think about and consciously
scck to improve it.

It may seem, .on the surface, that the acquir-
ing of good manners has little or nothing to do
with the student. {But it well-rounded college man
or woman has need of social graces. They arc to
him what 200 pounds of weight are to the football
plitycr, not absolutely necessary, but an asset in
breaking through the lillc for at touchdown. Good
manners make the road of life smoother for both
him who has them and for his associates.

What can we do zit Grinncll about manners?
Both men and women can consciously try to be
thoughtful of others in the daily routine. In so
doing, one will perform such simple, but helpful,
acts as opcning doors for others. For the women
there are many opportunities to attend tcas. Both
men and women can be gracious to their hall and
cottage hostesses. Dating gives an excellent oppor»
tunity for acquiring and displaying good manners.

To think about good manners, to obscrvc in-
dividuals who possess them, and to put into prac-
tice what one observes as \chI as what one already
knows are the necessary steps ill acquiring social
perfection.

G

THAT 50-50 PROPOSAL

That Grillncll college women are not stiffer-
ing from the depression to the extent of the men,
is evident from the flattering attendance at the
women’s Varsity dances. Now that the dating situ-
ation which shook the campus two years ago has
been remedied, it seems only fair that the women
should encourage this attitude through the spon-
soring of frequent varsitics, thus giving the inas-
culinc pocketbook a “break.”

The University of Missouri and Northwestern
university recently adopted a similar idea when
they publicly resolved to go fiftyrfifty on the dill.-
ing proposition, both ill making engagements and
in sharing the expense. The Varsity club is :1 step
in the right direction—it is the next best thing
to a Half mid Half club.

TIE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY
(From the Midland)

Looking over the list of students attending Midlénd,
one finds representations of many states, religions and
nationalities, and much diversification of interests. I!
one looks the visitors to our campus over carefully,
be will also find that we have guests of all types, from
college professors to candy salesmen.

We have, as it: were, a small cosmopolitan com-
munity. In this group one meets many persons whose
beliefs and customs are widely different from his own.
But this is not the place for narrow—minded snobbery.
There is a reason for what another person does. Dife
ferent heredity and environment yield different results.
If one shuts out all new things as being “bad" he
"cramps his style”7stays small. In almost every case
of difference we may learn something, and we may give
something of value to those with whom we disagree
also. Why not use a program of tolerance, and hear the
other side of the story before we act. It's worth more
to us,
