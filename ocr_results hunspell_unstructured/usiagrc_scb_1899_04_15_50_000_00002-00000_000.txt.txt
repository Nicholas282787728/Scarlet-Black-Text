THE wow: on the minstrel show
that is to be given next Friday
night, has been going on steadily
and satisfactorily and piomises to
produce an. excellent entertain»
merit. The show has been under
the management of town people
who are not connected with the
"college and on them has fallen
times! of the work. For this rcas~
on it no other the students ought
' to all turn out and show their
appreciation ot the generous
efforts made by fliends of the
college for the beneﬁt of the
Athletic Union. The high class
, of estertainment that this promise
cs to be and the fact that the pro
ceeds go to ﬁll the low treasury oi
the Union, ought to gather a full

THE THIRD annual Sophomore-
Freshman \ﬁcld meet will beheld
at Ward Field, Friday afternoon,
April 21. This is the ﬁrst ﬁeld
meet of the season, and ought to
bringoutalargecrowd. Although

. it is too early to expect any great

records to be made, the meet will
not be lacking in interest. There
is great rivalry between the ath-
letes of the two classes, and both
expect to win, though neither are
very conﬁdent of it. Many are
making prophecies as to number
of poinls each class Will win, but
no two Come to the same conclu-
sion, This uncertainty predicts
close contests in neaily all events
and adds much to the interest in
the meet. These meets are very
important in tliatthey help greatly
to develop new material and it is
to be hoped that they Will be well
supported so that they will not
die out. Indeed more interest
might well have been shown by

 

Miss Barrows’ Lecture.

Last evening Miss Mabel Hay
Barrows gave an illustrated stere»
optican lecture in the chapel, to a
large and appreciative audience.
Miss Barrows took for her subject
“A Trip to Greece.” The pict-
ures presented were all reproduc-
tions of pictures which she herself
had taken while on a journey
through Greece. By means of
them a very faithful portrayal of
the home lile ol the Greeks was
obtained; an accurate description
ot their dwellings was secured; a
vivid idea of the character of the
country was impressed upon the
minds ot the audience. Many ot
the views were taken from sights
in and around Athens. Those rep-
resenting the Acropolis, upon
which is situated the Parthenon
and other famous buildings, were
especially interesting.

With Miss Barlows,under whose
direction the Greek play, entitled
“The Return ot Odysseus,”
be given by the class of 1900. the
audience visited the land of Phoe
nicia, where Odysseus \vascast by
the waves‘ot the sea attcr being
shipwrecked; the place where Ale

will

cinaus, king ot.thc Phoenician: .

dwelt, was shown; the island Dc
los upon which the beautitul palm
tree grew, to which at a later per
riotl Odysseus coinpaied the bean
tiful Nausicas, was visited, besides

many other pictures oi the lile

and the country of the Grcclt.
The pictures portraying the life of
Odysseus were especially oppor.
tune, being presented at this time
just previous to the Greek play.
Thcy served as a very good Intros
ductiontothe play and will aid to
CI'Cztlca greater interest among
the slu'leitts and others in the
work which the juniors are ate
tempting.
