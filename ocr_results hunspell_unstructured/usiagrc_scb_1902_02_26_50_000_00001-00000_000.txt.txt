rn ConscqucncciDate will ‘
not be Filled.

Tire following letter was i'cccin
ed by Mr. c. w. Schlutsmcyci'on
Monday evening and is here res
printed. as it states the matter
nlori: completely than a dctttilcd‘l
explanation possibly could:

My Dear SiltiTo Dr. Van
Dyke's proiound regret the pro
longed overwork imposed upon
him by the charge oi the Brick
Church in New York in addition
to hrs regular duties at Princeton
has so much tniparred hrs health
that it will not be possible for
him to cotnplctc the lecture tou
arranged in the West. llts phy—
sician has Forbidden him to under
take the lectures Iowa and
Nebraska on the ground that long
railway journeys are lilrely to lead
to very consequences.
Dr. Van Dyke, thcretore, is very
sorry to Sily that the engagement
in Glinnell must be cancelled.

Yours vci-y truly,
D. l.tun\.\cr: CllUllihltS.

The cancellation Dr. \’uil
Dyke's engagement trillhea gteut
disappointment to the patrons of
the lecture course. but no one can
teel the regrct as keenly as does
the committee itself. It docs not
seem advisable to attempt to ﬁll
the date with anotherlectuie. In
such a short period oi iiinc r
mains between now and lllaich
8th. it is impoSsiblc to secure a
man of sufﬁcient ability to make
the substitution a just one, So
many other entertainments have
been planned to ﬁll the remaining
Friday and Saturday evenings
that there is no vacant date res
malning tor a later engagement.
In view at these facts
