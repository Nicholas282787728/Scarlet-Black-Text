When Lemoyne Gaard. a social

tral America, the International

Carmela Chacon Velazquez, a sccr
end-year Grinnell College student
from Costa Rica, to speak with the

ture. When the fourth-grade stu-

Participating intemational Students
receive no payment or class credit

the opportunity to help American
youngsters understand more about

about the rest at the world as stu-

about America,

took advantage of the question to
hrietiy explain Adolf Hitler and
Gen'nany’s involvement in World
War II, adding, “Germans are re-
ally not like that any more. People
think titathnnans are bad people
and that we're very aggressive and
we kill people. But Germans are
notl‘rkc that. We‘re very.very sorry
torwhat happened then, And ifyou
do that salute in Germany today,
people would bevery hurt and very
upsct.”Maureen Fitzgibbon,direc-
tor ofintcmattonal student services
at Grinnell College. believes that
the personal contact the program
provides is key to its success. “In
situations where international stu-
dents haven‘t been available for
presentations, we‘ve offered video
tapes of their previous talks." she
says. “But people don't seem to be
