Grinnell College will not sponsor a field
hockey team for the 1986-87 season, due to
lack of a schedule According to Dec Fair»
child. field hockey coach, the other schools
that Grinnell plays 7 University of North
Dakota. Eemidji. Lake Forest, Univeristy
of Chicago, University of Wisconsin-
Stevens Point, Wheaten, Luther. Iowa
Wesleyan, and Carleton have all drop»
ped their programs for similar reasons.

Another reason that Fairchild gave was
that some of the teams Grinnell has to play
are dirlicult to get to. and require traveling
a long distance, which can cause problems
academically for the athletes.

Fairchild dispelled rumors that the pro
gram was actually being dropped due to a
lack of administative support and that the
decision to drop field hockey was going to
allect women's soccer as a varsity sport.

Said Fairchlld: “Field Hockey has
nothing to do with the women's soccer pro
gram here at Grinnell. The administration

is willing at any point to help establish a

women's varsity program. Our problem
right now is finding other schools whose
administrations are Willing to do the same
thing. For now, our field hockey program
is in limbo for at least a year. If we get it
started again. it will be at least two years
for that to happen, We did end on a strong
note. though, by being ranked lourth in the
Midwest Region. I know that most players
are sad and disappointed to see their sport
dropped, but we tried to keep it around as
long as we could."

A few team members had a few coma
ments of their Own: Diana Lewis '89: We
were disappointed to see the sport drop-
ped. but we understand why it was done. I
hope to see it reestablished if we can get
enough schools to play

Blair Davison '89: I’ve played field
hockey since 6th grade, so I‘m not really
going to reel the effect until the fall season
rolls around, I thought we would have
another season. but we'll have to wait and
see if we can get the sport going again.

team; we played competitively throughout
the Season. We easily Could have had a 9-5
season, except for losing 2 Irrun games

beat every team in lhe Southern Division
at least once, except for Knox, which is the
real power." The Pioneers certainly have

Here at Griiincll, [here is Such a diverse
range of athletes. Many of them don't even
really identity with being an athlete. simp'
ly being a "participant" in athletics. If a
person was interested in gomg out for a

coaches. see what their program is like.
how it is structured. see if it fits your
abilities, expectations and goals. if you
have personality conflicts. and then talk to
the athletes to get their views. Will and

positive mental thinking and at motivating
people. They are in the process oi molding

ROBERT PARKER '87 Track: Athletics
at Griniiell are quite Varied. You have
some people that are in athletics to take up
time. and you have those that are
motivated to do well.

Basically the intensity level of team
members is quite different. and Will and
Evelyn do a good job in coaching all sorts
of team members who have these different
aspirations. They're there if you need e»
no coaching. and they certainly put in a lot
of time at what they do.

takes a lot more responsibility and dedicar
tion. on some bad days. with tests and
such. il takes a lot more to get up to go ruii.

to put into the workouts: there's no obligar
