CCASIONALLY ﬁrst class

NewDominion”.SanfordDodgein
“Richard III”, John Arthur in
“Cyrano de Bergerac", and Paul
cazeneuve in “What Happened
toJoncs". Thursday night Chas.
B. Hanlord produced “Private
John Allen". High grade theatrir
cal productions in Grinnell are
greatly handicapped through a
lack ot proper conveniences.
Grinnell needs at good opera
House. One way to hasten the
building of such a house is to
patronize the best companies
,which visit the city, and in this
way createademand for better
facilities. While the student does
not come to college primarily lor
the purpose ot cultivating a taste
rortheatre going,and wliilcstudies
and other work directly connect
ed with the college must occupy
the major part or his time, never
tlteless a judicious attendance at
the ﬁrst-class productions, which
are sometimes played in Grinnell,
is not at all to be frowned upon.
The drama. besides being a please
ing diversion, is as much along
the line of education as other
works of art and music. With a
new Opera House and more of the
better grade dramas, an occasion-

al opportunity of this kind would
become a recognized factor oi
amusement and instruction, as our
lecture and concert courses are at
present. To repeat, the student‘s
attendance must be very modemte.
but even this would show an ap-
preciation of the best plays. and
in time might induce the building
ot a new Opera House. Such a
convenience is needed by a college
town, not only for the purpose
just mentioned, but for lectures,
musicals,ptivatc thentricals, etc.
Grinnell should have such an ad-

vantage.
