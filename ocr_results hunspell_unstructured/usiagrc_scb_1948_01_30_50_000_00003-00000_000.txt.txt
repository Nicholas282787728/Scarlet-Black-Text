S+evens Speaks
On Drinking Rule

Trustees Deny Requesf

By Women For Change I

”I am opposed w the use of
alcohol. whether it is temperate
or intemperate, whether it is
used by men or women. rampar—
ticularly opposcd to women
drinking," said President stevens
in his scech to upperclass women
in the little theatre Wednesday
night.

After stating his objections on
personal, physiological, rational,
and moral grounds, President
Stevens stated that the board of
trustees does not feel that the,
present drinking 1111a: should be‘
modified.

Replying to the League Board,
poll, in which women students
expressed themselves in favor ot
drinking on campus to the ex-
tent that is socially acceptable,
the trustees take the view that:
it is not in their province to al-‘
low women over 21 to drink. ,As_
for girls under 21, they feel there'
should he no question of drink-i
ing, since it is in violation of the‘
law, said President Stevens.

Wlule he was at the Institute
of Biochemistry of John Hopkins
university, President stevcns had
the opportunity to study the
biological effects of alcohol on}
the mind and body. He stated
that “one out of every 14 women
who indulged in alcohol become
alcoholics."
