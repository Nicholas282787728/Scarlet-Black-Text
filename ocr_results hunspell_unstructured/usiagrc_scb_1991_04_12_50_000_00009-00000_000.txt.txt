Nashville

Director Robert Alu-nan's 1975 ﬁlm Nashville is sprawling. fascinating, and somewhat lacking in plol. Nccnssarily
dated (this is Lht movre to see llyou want to know what life was really like in the mid-1970's), Nashville ties together
the stones ot several people involved in the eounny/westem music business. More unponantly. however. it presents
an unﬂinching look at America - with all her sentimentality, pride and delusions. Nashville, shown in ARH 30’2 tonight
and tomorrow a|3 pm. and Sunday at 2 p m., rurls more than two hours in length but is. ultimately avery rewarding

Lavner to bring music,

laughter to

By Alanna Walen

One snowy aftcmoon in Febru-
ary my phone rang, an offrcnmpus
call, and l innocently picked it up.

“Hi, this is Lynn Lavner. Have
you heard my name before?”

“Uh, uh, yeah, of coursel have."

“Well, I’ve been wanLirlg to
come perform at Grinnell for years
now, and it so happens that I’m
going toheinLincoln,Nehraskaon
April 19th and l was wondering if
you'd be interested in having me
come there."

I have a feeling that very few
things in my lite will fall together
so beautifully as this transaction,
the booking of Lynn Lavner as our
Pride chk concert. She Will per
form at 7 pm. this Wednesday in
Saudi Lounge.

Lavner hogan playing the piano
and writing songs at age seven,
latcr moving on to the pianohnrs of
Greenwich Village. Hcr act is it
unique combinthion of music and
comedy that 15 well known and
appreciated within the guy commu-
nily, She sings about crushes on

Pride Week

movie stars, Anne Frank, cats who
become more imponant than love
em, and friends who have died of
AIDS. She is not easily defined or
categorized.

She has played to audiences all
over the world, most recently in
Australia. Grinnell is very fortunate
to havclhc opportunity to enjoy her
performance. Evcryone will find
her interesting it not downright
hysterical. Herhiography summing
up her intent, reads, “Whilc hcr act
is gay in content, her appearancc is
aimed at a playful parody of ste-
rentypes, and the material is u
versallyappreciatcdhyanyonewith
an open sensc of humor."

Art exhibit reveals
thoughts, feelings of
the homeless

By Rob Killen

Unspoken Identities, an an ex-
hibitcuncndydisplaycdin Burllng
basement. documents the drawings
and paintings of a group of home-
less individuals stayingatCoopcr’s
Place, a homeless shelter in the
WestLoop ofChicago. Thecxhibit
was organized by the gcncrous Mr.
Greg Aprahamian, who held art
workshops in Chicago shelters for
nearly a year.

Though ata glance some of the
artwork might easily be mistaken
for the work otchiltlren, the pieces
dealwittt themes which areatarcry
from innocent.

“Undemezllh the veil of sim-
plicity, there lies a wealth or amen
tion, humor, and creativity!" ex~
claimed one student.

Many of the pictures express a
longing for a scnsc ofhome; others
are sell-portraits. Somc arc cx-
prcssidns of frustration, and othcis
of tranquillity.

Sludcnt Susan Treincn praised a
Slark onerdimcsiontll image of a
houseand yard drawn by Artist Lil
Pezera, explaining, “I like it he
cause she has made it look like
paint even though it's done in
crayon."

hcr murdered son, artist Marie
Babino cleverly manipulates the
brush slroke in a series of slashing
motions to create a feeling of fleet-
ing time.

“Babino's picture really dcpicLs
her complexity of emotions and
shows that she has gone through a
very traumaLic cxpcrience,as if she
had just been hurt," commented
student Shayma Saiyid.

Other unists make distinct con-
Ll'lbuLinns to Lhe exhibit as well,
Anthony Wilson uses watercolors
to clfcctivcly communicate his
sense of the bizarre in his works
WDmnlrtLoveand UnlversalLove.
Melvin Dayls has a COIISCLlOn 0!
four pictures which. at ﬁrst ap-
pcaring to be abstract, are actually
slrippcdrdown images of Chicago.
Arlene Shelton conu’ibutes thrcc
watercolors of placid country
landscapes. Renee Rutus has two
watercolors which very clearly
bring out thcconfusion ofhis world.
Each one is an abstract mixture of
words and symbols randomly
placed on the paper.

This exhibit, sponsored hy the
Roscnficld Commitlcc, is unusual
because it depicts the thoughts and
feelings of people who go largely
unnoticed, and offers a unique per
spective on the world.
