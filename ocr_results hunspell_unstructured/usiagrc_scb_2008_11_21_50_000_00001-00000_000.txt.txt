At 6:30 last night, 25 students left for Fort
Benning, Georgia to participate in the “2008
School of the Americas Watch Convergence
of Hope and Resistance." Yet just one week
ago, after a series ofbotched communications,
those same students were told that the College
would withdraw the trips funding. While the
funding was ultimately granted. the episode
raised questions about the legality of funding
such trips, which some feared would jeopar-
dize similar activities in the ﬁiturer

For weeks, students had gathered fund-

ing pledges to help cover nearly $7000 in
transportation costs to participate in a protest
against the School of the Americas, a military
installation accused of training Latin Ameris
can paramilitaries. But still roughly $2000
short. organizers approached Student Affarrs
to cover the rest. After some Student Affairs
employees expressed concerns over the legals
ity ofa nonTPl’Oﬁl funding a seemingly politir
cal activity Vice President for Student Affairs
Houston Dougharty approached President
Russell K. Osgood on the matter.

Osgood had initially advised that the Cole
loge not provitic funding because ofa combi-

nation of both legal and ﬁnancial factors That
afternoon Dougharty told SGA Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs John Burrows '10
about the decision, wlio relayed the message
to trip organizers.

That night, organizers called an emer-
gency meeting and began circulating a peti-
tioii in support of the trip. As they had not
been ofﬁcially notiﬁed of the decision or why
it was made, the students contemplated more
extreme responses such as biinging the protest
to Grinnell.

Student organizers said they were part

Chris Hade benefit concert to raise money for cancer treatment

BYRACIIELFIELDS

Shortly after his high school graduation,
Chris Hade, who entered Grinnell with the
class of ’09, fell from a climbing course at a
graduation party and hurt his tailbone. He
nursed the injury for a while, but the doctors
said not to worry~a long healing process was
natural. But by spring break of his freshman
year at Grinnell, his mother noticed he had
been taking large amounts of ibuprofen for
the paint concerned, she set up an appoint-
ment with l—Iade's uncle, a local radiologist.
Tire scans showed the beginnings ofa rate and
inoperable cancer.

Hadc‘s cancer is called sacial cliordonia,
and because it is rare, it has fewer available
treatments and less funding for researchAftei
MD Cancer Center in Houston established a
treatment regime, Chris underwent chemo
therapy and radiation at Mercy Hospital in
Des Moines. The radiation was more effec—
tive, but it wasn't enough, and the cancer has

spread from Hades tailbone to other par-ts of
his body.

Hadye remained at Giiiincll until haltway
through his junioi year, when his increasing
physical problems forced lilm to drop out.
Currently he lives at home in Indianola, Iowa,
and sits in a wheelchair. As traditional treat
ments have been exhausted, Hadcs' family
hope to move on to experimental treatmciitS,
which their insurance, unfortunately, will not
cover.

When she heard about the financial prob-
lem, family friend Nancy Lickiss came to the
Hades with a suggestion. She knew that music
had always been central to I’lade’s life, and she
had an idea that would draw crowds and raise
moneyia local benefit concert.

“He’s such a wondeiful, wonderful kid,aiid
there are so many people in town who want
ed to help him out." Lickiss said. “A concert
seemed to he the perfect thing to honor him."

Joe Schneider '09 agreed. Schneider has

been friends with Ilade since their ﬁrst-year,
and said he saw his friends love for music as
Hade performed with Gliniiell Singers, the Ge
Tories, and even einbaiked on an international
singing tour. Music just seemed the obvious
choice. he said, considering Hade’s experiences
at Grinnell.

Schneider, who met Hade after his initial
diagnosis, said the disease has been a difﬁcult
process to wnrclr. “It’s been tough seeing
someone struggle through disease, particularly
someone who's such a good friend,” he sard.
“But he smiles through the whole thing. It
builds my own courage.”

some people change in tirffcrent company,
Schneider said, but Hade is not like that He
related a story about their first year, a night
when a few hours ofpartying left Hade under
the weather on the James loggia.

“We asked him if he wanted a glass ofwa-
ter, and he inst turned atound and said, ‘No
thanit you,1’rn frnc right now," Schneider said.
