Pioneer Ca-gers Defeat Carleton, 67-54:,

Grinnell, slowly Climbing in

the Conference basketball stand-

ings, knocked a tough Carleton five out oi third place last Satur—
day night by virtue of a 67754 triumph. ln dumping the Carls the
Scarlet and Black won its third loop contest to move up a notch
and take undisputed possession of fifth place.

“Carleton played a better
game against us than Lawrence
did, primarily because the Carls
are the best rebounding and do
fensive clnb we’ve faced to date,"
affirmed Coach Pfitsch.

A combination of Carleton’s
poor shooting and Grinnell's
35% average accounted for the
Pioneers‘ margin of victory.
Dave Dunlop, with 23 points,
again walked off with the game’s
Also bulk—
ing large in the Pioneer success
was Pelsner with 13 points.
Saunders with 11-, Helny with
10, and Bigelow with 7,

Not only did the Carls have
the height advantage but Carson
and Schlaffer, both regular
Carleton forwards withdrew
from under the backboards tot
play guard. This forced Bigee'
low and Dunlop, who were then
guarding Caralson and Schlaf»
fer ,to also withdraw, and thus
lesson Grinnell’s rebounding
strength.

The Pioneers, in opening the
game, grabbed the lead and ran,
their advantage to 6-2 and 11-7
before Carleton was able to close
the gap and knot the count at
21 all with 13 minutes of the
first half gone. Grinnell, how.
ever, finished the period strong
to leave the court at half time
with a 31-25 advantage.

Spearheading Grinnell’s first
half attack were Dave Dunlop
with 12 points and Earl Peisner
with-11. Together they account-

ed for 74% o: the Pioneers’
first period scoring.
After the intermission, the

Scarlet and Black returned to
put on a 11—point—2X/a minute
scoring barrage.
