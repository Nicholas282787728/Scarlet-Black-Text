ICLOSE DECISION GIVES
IONIAN VICTORY IN AN-
NUAL DEBATE.

ELLSWORTH'S WORK IS EEATURE

Leader of Ionian Team Is Big
Factor in Winning $60
Prize For Negative
of Question.

By a three to two dccision In favor
or the negative, Ionian society won
over Institute in the bier-rill Debate at
the Colonial Theatre Monday evening
on the live question, "Resolved: That
Senator Cumnriiis Should be rte-elected
to the United States Senate," Ells-
worth's work for the negative was
the whining factor of the debate.

The men who upheld the affirmative
l'or institute were J. B. MacGregor.
Mani-ice Fl’idlnhd, and Glenn nicliards.
The Ionian men who upheld the mega:
tive of the question were James Me»

Connghie, James Simmons, and Her-
man Ellsworth.

Little Clash in Argumenis.
There was very little clash in the
arguments of the two sides, The af-
ﬁrmative argued that Cnmnrirrs should
be rerelected because he is the best
possible choice for Iowa to make, whila
the negatiie argued that a man should
be sent to the Sclrate who would up—
hold the policies or the administration

in the pies rit inter-national cits
In the opening speech tor the atfirm—

.ative, MacGregol' said that we should

ask or a United States Senator experi-
ence, that he should have principles,
and that he should be a man 0: the
highest thought and action,

"The career of Senator Cirmmins
has been one of iniegr y, insight, and
broad-mindedtress," was a strong
point.

Slrnulil Support w sou.

MacConhghie was the ﬁrst Speaker
[or the negative He attempted [or
prove [hat Mr \Vilson and the adminis-
tration should he supported by return-
ing a Democrat as senator. He then,
dwelt on the good which the present
administration has done and die hecey
lSity for‘a senate which will not oppose
it in its policies.

in the second speech Tor the aim-ina-
tive, Frldlulid brought out Connolly's
.record as being one at the (mouthing
sort, while be characterized the prin-
ciples and policies oil Cmumius as tar
superior to those ot his opponents.

Simmons, the next speaitw' tor the
negative, made the per -t 'ihal the pres-
crrt international cric'is demands thax
we support President Wilson, “Iowa
places her stamp oi approval on am
la‘dministmtioi," he said. “That is
good may continue, a senate aims: he
etnrned which will uphold its meas—
ures and policies."

Curnriiiiis For Town.

Tire third speaker [or the airirniatrve
was Richards. He said that Currunios'
-pciieies are lowa-a policies. He there
suuurra .ed tor the negative, snowing
ihal Cummins' experience.l s policies,
and his convictions, proved him to he
the best man for the senate.

Ellsworth spoke last [or the neg'ae

senate must be returned which win
