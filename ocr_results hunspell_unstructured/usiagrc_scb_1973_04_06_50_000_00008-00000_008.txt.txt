Honorarium to Dr. King
Miles oisorrow down sleepy, southern roads
Now you lie still.

Once you threw a pebble,
Caused a landslide,

Litted your voice,

Shook the pedestal ot Justice,

Raised slowly your palm-ilattened hands
And gathered a people

Loudspeakers tired your message into the
crowd,

Woundiug many, killing nonc,

Then someone tired hack,

Justice smiled her magnolia grimace,
Peeping through holes 01 white

EDDIE KENDRICKS

Eddie Kendricks is an entertainer whose
life style and career stand in direct antis
thesis to all established stereotypes of en-
tertainers and show business people. Cool
prone to solitude, deeply religious, thor»
oughly committed to his associates and
pi-oyincially honest, Eddie is a man ior
Whom the solidarity of his Southern Pro-
testant rearing has remained untlagging in
an industry sometimes typiiied by moral
failures.

This combination has proven to be :1 wins
ning one [or Eddie, {or while he was with
the Temptations as their talsettosvoiced
lead singer, he led them to the tops oi
the record chart polls With such mefnor-
able hit tunes as “The Way You Do The
Things You Do,” “My Girl,” “Ain’t Too
Proud to Beg,” "Get Ready,” “Beauty is
Only Skin Deep,” “My Baby,_ “It’s Grow»
ing,” “l'll Be in Trouble,” “Girl, Wthou
Want to Make Me Blue,” “Cloud Nine,"
“1 Wish It Would Rain," "Ball at Confus-
ion," “I’m Gonna Make You Love Me”
and “Don’t Let the Joneses Get You Down."
Alter years at such successes, Eddie has
now launched a solo career with an album
appropriately titled “All By Myseli,”which
toilows 17 hit albums he did With The
Temptations,

Born in Birmingham, Alabma, the second
oldest at five children, Kendricks was
reared with the belieithat personal progress
is the result at hard work, and he becomes
restless when he isn’t moving, working or

 

doing something constructive.

He collects stereo record players and h'
spoken of someday having a house with
swimming pool, though he can’t SWll

Though Eddie is intensely interested
entertainers becoming involved in politil
and in establishing self-help programs 1
inner city youth, his main concentration
this time is his career, and in developi
himself as a musician,

01 his separation from The Temptatio.
and his subsequent emergence as a so
artist, Kendricks says, “i liked singi
the kind of music we became known to
but I felt I could sing something else, to
I wanted to extend my musical sell. i wa
ted to reach ior my potential, I didn
feel that being what and where lwas wi
the Temps was developing me to in
point.”

So, Eddie decided to cut an album on hi
own which would be diiierent, and “A
By Myselt” was born. Though he had n
intentions at the time of using the albu
to launch a solo career, it turned oi
to be a ﬁtting vehicle.

Eddie, never one to be content to rid
along on past successes, is eagerly re
ceptive to new ideas and is determin
to maintain the same high level oi per
tormance he shared With the Temptations
it is this same degree of dedication whic
makes Eddie Kendricks one or the most
unique entertainers in today’s musica
world.
