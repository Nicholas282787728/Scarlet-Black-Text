Oskamp Devising Standard Slat Test

By Diane Powell

Stu Oskamp, Gates senior, is now able to sympathize greatly
with those in the teaching profession.

For Stu, a psychology major, has been busy making up a

standardized test in elementary
his senior honors project.

A standardized test is one in'

which everything is standard
ized: the administration, instruc.
tions, interpretation,, and norms.
it Slu's liuished test is
good enough, there is a possi-
bility or its being published.
it will fill a deiinite need,
tor Stu ﬁrst became inter-
ested in the project when
Charles F. l-iauer (psycho-
logy) was unable to rind a
standardized test ior his
statistics class.
Two-Year Project
A long term project, the work
will probably be iinished in two
years. it was begun in Septem-
ber, when Oskamp pored over
hundreds oi college catalogs in
the office of Miss Bethana Mc-
Candless, registrar. He finally
selected 35 colleges in 21 dirier-
ent states wtih which to corres-
pond. Alter studying their liter—
ature, he was able to see what
was taught and what he should
emphasize in the test.

For assistance in tormiug
questions, Oskamp surveyed
niue textbooks and various
tests used at numerous col-

stalisucs. It’s all a major part of

leges. During Christmas va-
cation, he started to write
the actual test items, When
he is iinishcd, two prelimi—
nary iorms ofi about 100
questions each will be sent
to various schools.

There, through testing, they
will be checked for diitioulty
and discrimination. The best
questions will be culled to form
a tinal test of about so true and
false and multiple choice ques-
tions. it will be checked by
Oskamp for reliability and val~
idity.

Because oi his work, Oskamp
has realized that torming a sat
isractory test is no simple job,
He had to be careiul to avoid
ambiguity, negatives, and vague
wording. But if his finished
work is successful, he will have
established a precedent.
