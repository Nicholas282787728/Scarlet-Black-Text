From it rise the delectable
whirts of frying meat, tender-
loins, hamburgers, and now
and then a hit of pickle. This
is the place from which you
never return the same, no
longer that emptiness but a
sweet sense of renewed youth
and hunger sated. This is
the place the doggy friends of
the campus are apt to follow
one to and from, if not in.
Whut is this haven? Ah, we
have it, the ’NUrWAY INN!
