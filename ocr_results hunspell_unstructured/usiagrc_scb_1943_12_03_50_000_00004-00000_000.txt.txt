Gi‘innell is not alone in drop-
ping intercollegiate athletics
for the duration, for, of the
eight members of the Mid-
west Conference, only three
will foot cage teams coin-
pared to the two that boasted
grid outfits.

This will be the first time in 23
yms that the conference has not
presented a basketball program.

Lawrence has a velz Navy unit
and Cornell and Monmouth have

Lawrence, and Monmouth who
will have basketball teams a all
have army units.

Each of the three playing meme
bers have attractive schedules but
do not meet each other, In sev-
eral instances university and serv-
ice teams will be the opposition.

It is interesting to note that
the Midwest Conference is one of
the most evenly matched inter~
collegiate leagues in the nation. A
look at past records shows thal
all members except Crinncll have
won championships in all three
major sports. In justice to the
Pioneers it must be noted that
they have been a member of the
league only the last four or its
23 year history, and in that won
a basketball title.

In minor sports also the com-
petition has been close although
Cornell has dominated wrestling

There is certainly no need to
think that Grinnell is being left
out in the cold so to speak. The
very apparent drop of athletics in
general among small schools
makes it obvious that we are not
alone in being without intercol-

 

legiate athletics for the duration.
