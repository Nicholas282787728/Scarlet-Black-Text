The solar systems most iamous comet
will make a return trip this winter. and
will be the subject of the most detailed
scientiiic study ot a comet ever made. says
proicssor Robert Cadmus.

Cadrnus spoke at the South Lounge Tues-
day night on this year's appearance oi
comet Halley. giving an overview oi the
comet's history and current theories on the
nature oi the obiects.

Cadmus said astronomers generally
u nderstand comets to be conglomcrations
til ice. dust and rock iragments. “This
model is popularly known as the dirty
snowball theory." he added.

Comets are now believed to originate in
a layer ol’ gas and debris outside of the
solar system known as the port comet

tract black candidates.

The primary reason that the trustees
i-cversed their stance was because oi the
r nt legal and social controversy that
has surrounded the position. "CH“

plained.

Additionally. viith this change in con-

lheory, he said. disturbances such as pa s-
ing meteors occasionally knock materials

hit.

The appearance oi a comet oiten caused
a panic in the past largely because they ap-
peared unpredictably. Cadmus said,
“That upset the astrologers a lot and a
many bad things were associated with
them" he said.

The appearance or a comet. he pointed
out. inspired the Roman emperor Nero to
have his political opponents killed to prove
that the omen applied to them and not him.

"A related question at point oi view is
the case oi the Norman Conquest." he add-
ed. displaying a portion oi the Bayeaux

Cadmus said comets have virtually no
real ettect on the earth. "There are low
things as safe as comets. he said

But panics over comets persisted as late
as the last appearance oi comet Halley in
1910. Cadmus said. He explained that an
early spectroscope detected traces oi
cyanide in the comet’s tail, which passed
through the earth‘s orbit.

Many ieared the tail would poison the air

mosphere. Cadmus said. But he pointed-

out that the tail is less dense than a good
laboratory vacuum and is completely
harmless.

"Probably the most proiound eiiect is
cultural," he continued, pointing to the

"There are. however. possible dramatic
ciiects." he said. He described an unexs
olained explosion in Siberia in 1903 which
levelled trees over a large area and was
apparently heard in Europe, The lack oi
debris iollowing the explosion may in
dicatc a small comet nucleus caused the
blast.

Cadmus predicted the comet's current
visit would disappoint most viewers. “It's
just about the worst possible combination
ot circumstances." he said
' Unlike the 1910 visit. comet Halley will
be on the tar side or the sun at its
perihelion. or nearest approach to the
earth. it will also appear very low in the
sky irom the northern hemisphere and will
be highest and brightest when prominent
moons will make viewing conditions dri-
llcull. Cadmus Said.

But he said this approach would see the
most scientilically advanced study oi a
comet ever made. Soviet. Japanese, and
European Space Agency probes will study
the comet as it passes at close range.

Though some existing American probes
will take readings. no exclusively
American probe oi the comet was iunded.
Cadmus agreed this is a lost opportunity.
but pointed out that Americans were par-
ticipating in the Japanese and European
surveys.

Halley's will probably make many more
passes. losing about one percent oi its
mass on each orbit, Cadmus said.
However, "This may be the last time we
will see the comet ll we don't. regulate
nuclear weapons and other problems." he
said.

The comet will be barely visible to the
naked eye tor most oi December, it will be
unviewable in January as it rounds the sun
a no is lost to sight.

time. the comet will be visible very low on
the eastern horizon during early morning
hours,
