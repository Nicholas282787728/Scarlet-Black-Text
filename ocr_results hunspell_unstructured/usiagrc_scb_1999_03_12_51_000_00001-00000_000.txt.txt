Although the storm, at least in this

there is such a thing, it was heartening

'forState

The Grinnell Tigers have turned
an average basketball season into
what suddenly has become a very
big deal' a trip to the state tourna—
ment in a bid to becomc Iowa’s
Class 3A champs, »

Grinnell held off Perry, 56753,
Tuesday to qualify for the trip to
Des Moines.

The Tigers will take on Daven—
port Assumption at 3:30p.m. Tues-
day, March 16, at Veterans Memos
rial Auditorium in the capital crty.

This wcek's win improved Grin-
nell‘s overall record to 11-11.

The Tigers’ lateaseason surge has
been the result ofwhat Coach Scott
Sharp said is a new beliefin theme

When there’s heavy snow on the street and a big plow moves it to the curb, the results can be pretty
dramatic. A case in point: mailboxes up to their lids in dense snow on East St. near the middle school.

Grinnell, of course, was lucky. Some

Some businesses closed their doors

actually occurred,

Work completed early

But city, county and state crews had
completed much of the work by mid-
momiilg Tuesday. Drivers had little
trouble negotiating streets and highways
in the Grinnell area.

The snowfall here melted down to .95
inch of liquid precipitation 7 a heavy
amount by aiiybody‘s calculation. But
the moisture content was the key Meteo—
rologists often say that, as a general nile,
,io inch of liquid precipitation equals
aboutan inch ofsnow. So Grinnell could

have received over 9 inches, had the
snow contained a bit less moisture.

That .95 inch ofpreeipiration brought
Grinnell’s March total to 1.30 inches so
far. Theavei-age here forthcciitire month
is 2.41 inches.

So far this winter season, Grinnell has
picked up 25.3 inches ofsnow, with 7.5
inchesof that falling in March. The snow
total for 1999 is 18.6 inches to date.

Young |Owans turned off
by the thought of voting

Chet Culver, Iowa‘s new secretary of state, expressed some alarm the other

Iowans when it comes to voting.

, day over statistics that should a broad antipathy on the pan of youiigci

Culver studied the last general election and discovered that the tumotit
among those in the l8-24-ycar-old age bracket was an abysmal to percent.

He’s right, that's pretty said.

Why are so many young voters simply opting to stay at home on Election

Day? Among commonly cited reasons:

. One vote simply doesn’t make any difference. That's a pretty lame

excuse. Many elections have hinged on
ally even a single vote,
- Why vote if you don‘t understand

only a handful ot‘votcs — occasion—

the issues? Not understanding the
issues usually translates in not
having paid attention to what’s
going on locally, nationally and
internationally. And perhaps that's a
failing oftlie education system.
Schools need to try harder to help
students focus on the evciiis that
shape the community and the nation
Their those students will emerge
with 21 greater appreciation for
current events and the elected

leaders who crall ihc policies of governance,

- There’s no real difference between the candidates. That’s a partictiL
lrlrly cynical assertion. Maybe some political hopefuls do seem cut from the
shine mold, but no candidate is without a political philosophy. And there is a
trend toward groatcr selection as third-party and independent movements
grow and nominate people to rim for office.

Another reason, of course, is the cynicism brcti by scandal and partisan-
ship Politicians have to accept miicli oftlic blilthC for voter enntii. But the
only way to chiiiigc that is by encouraging more, not less, eiiizeii punlclpaa

tion in the political process.

Those who don’t take part, though, really don't have much to complain
about ii'they see tlicirgovcihmeiit drifting in what they believe is the wrong

direction.

The lug challenge for people like Culver and others wlro want to ignite
some enthusiasm among young voters is ofl'Ci means ofpiu-ticipatioii that
seem real and prodiictivc. Culvei, who may have political ambitions that go
far beyond being secretary ofstatc, has the time to get out turd about, visit
schools throughout Iowa and give students a iciison for political enthusiasm
Iowa’s teachers have the same responsibility.

Letters

Wants review
of sign policy

To the editor:

lnlhe fallofl997,SecurityBanl<
(now F&M Batik) installed a blink-
ing advertising sign on Sixth Ave.
The sign struckmetheiiasinappro-
priatetoits surroundingsdistrace
ing to drivers in a busy pedestrian
tired, and inconsiderate to college
students living in neighboring
houses. i wrote and hand-deliv-
crcd a letter to the bank president
expressing my concern about the
sign, He replied in writing that he
would request adjustments to the
pacingand formattiiigoftlic sign's
messages, but that the sign had
beenclearedby the properauthori-
tics and would remain.

With the recent installation ofa
second blinking sign at the Deere
Credit Union on Wcst St., I de-
cided to look into the ordinances
governing such matters. I have
learned that these signs are ‘d di-
rect violation of our Municipal
Code.

Section 4-26 of the code ex-
pressly prohibits “any sign that
makes use ofbeacon lights, flashe
ing, blinking or traveling light."
In a January letter to the mayor
rind the city manager, I inquired
about the apparent violations of
this scctionofthc code The direCa

torofbuildingand planning wrote
back, indicating that he had dis—
cussed tlresignswith CityCouncil
members who approved them,
viewing tllem as informational
rather than for advertising. He also
acknowledged that there had been
complaints from residents of a
house adjacent to one ofrhc signs.

Our sign ordinance pertains to
signs defined as “any medium
used or intended to be used to
attract attention .to the subject
matter for advertising purposes“
(Section 4-22). Everyone I have
questioned on the matter agrees
thin the blinking signs appear to
satisfy this definition. Our city
leaders apparently disagree.

ln decrding to allow the signs,
our local government has set itself
up as an arbiter of content, drawe
inguntenabledistinctions between
information and advertising. All
advertising is, to some degree,
informational Nonetheless, it
seems obvious to methat theblink—
ing signs seek to “attract attention
to the Subject matter for advertis-
ing purposes." Therefore, the
Municipal Code prohibits them.

According to the director of'
buildrngandpianning.ihc council
will review the sign ordinance in
the near future. I hope that others
who share my concern that such
signs erode safety, estlietic stan-
dards and neighborly relations in
Grinnell will make their views
known to council members and
the mayor‘s office. More such
signs will appear here unless our
leaders enforce the ordinances they
have enacted, a Jon Chenette,
