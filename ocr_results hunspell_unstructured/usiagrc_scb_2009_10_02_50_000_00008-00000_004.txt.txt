Writing Conservatism, Editing The New ,
York Times and Talking Grinnell College

New York Times Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus ’77 pays a visit to his old stomping .
grounds to promote his new book, The Death of Conservatism; the 5&3 Magazine reviews it

or Reuteccn PARK

The Deal/i ofClzpim/irm is an elegant little book. The slene
det unadorned white cover fits as easily in the hand as it does
on the bookshelf. It maintains an appropriately conservative
aesthetic—what better way to illustrate that the values of true
conservatism, devoted more to preserving the balance ofpower
than advocating for the en vogue movementeofetheeminute?

The manifesto’s author, New York Time: 1?qu Rewiew Edi-
tor Sam Tanenhaus ’77, recently came to campus as part ofthc
Writersocrinnen program, run by Carolyn Jacobson, English.
More than just an average book tour srop,Tanenhaus~a mem-
ber of the Grinnell class of1977—was returning to a lace he
knows well. He is a delightful and rare anomalyﬁi rrnnell'
graduate and member of that most elitist of all Liberal media
institutions, he is also a nationally known conservative advoe
care, Yet he never oozes the kind of pretentious corporate capir

taljst sleaze associated
with your stereotypical
modern Republican.
Instead, as he dem-
onstrated this past
Monday, he is affable,
approachable and all
other genres of adjece
tives that suggest the
kind of good nature one hopes to see in the alumni of onc's
school

And, unsurprisingly enough, he's smart and a good writer.
No matter your political beliefs, he presents a convincing, easya
to-follow argument, free from overwhelming wonkincss and
insider references that so often drag down political writing. En-
gaging the reader, he forces you to reconsider traditionally held
opinions. You might not frnrsh the book ready to go out and
radically change your lite—there’s not a huge chance that you
will switch your party affiliationibut you will have a greater
appreciation for the intersection ofpolitics, history and persons
aljries. The American political system is not all about ideology;
it is the push-andrshove between leaders and movements, the
elected and the electing.

Tanenhaus proposes that the contemporary practice of con—
servatism is tar from what the philosophy’s founders—think-
ers like Edmund Burke and Benjamin Disraeliioriginally
conceived. The current inception of the American Republican
Party is more about movement politics and us-against-thcm
argumentation than truly preserving the social order and the
power relations that maintain in

Once upon a time, “conservative arguments...spoke to the
deepest issues of culnrre and society/,"Tanenhaus writes. Now,
irrﬂghting dommates,with “exhortationsfrom the Right (0 the
Right: to uphold ’basics' and ‘principles,’ to stand tall against
liberals—even if it means evading the most pressing issues of
the movement." And without a well-functioning righbwing
party, we’re left without productive political opposition. Avoid-
ing passing judgment and forcing values at the reader, hc ere
plains and convinces why the validity ofAmerican conservas
trsrn is on the wane and why, ultimately, this dechne is not a
good thing for the country.
