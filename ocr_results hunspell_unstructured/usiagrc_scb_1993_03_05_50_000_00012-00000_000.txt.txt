ECAUSE the indoor season

for the Grinnell College
women‘s track team is the Midwest
Conference championship. Today
and tomorrow the Pioneers travel to
Knox College with theirfocus on one
thing, improvement.

Last March the team finished
lastintheleague,butthisyearshould
be a different story. “I think we’ll
move up the ladder. Everyone is
healthy and we certainly can’t go
down in the standings,“ commented
Coach Evelyn Freeman. The
Pioneers have already beaten one
team, Knox. at the league’s south
division meet.

Two rookie distance runners,
Ally Beckman and Stephanie
Hitzialcr,shouldscoremultiplepoinls
for Freeman. Beckman is slated for
the 5000M while Hitztalcr will rim

themiddie distances. Another runner,
Jennifer Jacobson, has shown great
improvement all season and should
be a threat to score in the 1500M and
5000M.
Sprinters Amy Reinhart and

I ennifer Jon“ could score in multiple
sprint events and will anchor the
relays. The duo is joined by Janice
Lee, and either Rissy Taylor or
Melanie Parson in the 4x200 relay,
and Lee and another runner to be
announced in the 4x400 relay.

the latter ran a 44.92 in the 300M.

Men’sBasketballTeam
Finishes Season 10—12

By Alex Severens

 

 

H131992-93 Grinnoll Collegcmcn's basketball team wrapped up
its season with a big victory at Mt. St. Claire. The Pioneers
ended the season with a 10712 overall record and a 5-9 mark in

the Midwest Conference.

“The victory at Mt. St. Claire was a pleasant surprise," commented
Coach Dave Arseneault after the 77-68 victory. The Pioneers defeated
the Mounties in Grinnell earlier in the Season, but “we were coming off
two losses and our practices had not been too impressive, so it was a bit
ofa surprise to come out and play so well.”

The Pioneers did nearly everything right in the Mt. St. Claire game,
according to Arseneault. “We look good shots. we made good cuts and
we screened well. We've shown that we can execute; I just wish we
could havedone those thingsall yearlong.” ThePioneers hitablisteririg
67% from the floor, including 80% in the second half.

Steve Diekmann was back in his usual shootinggrove as he hit 8 out
of 11 shots for 22 pomts. Geoff Johnson also put in 22 on 9 of 11
shooting.

Arseneault ranked the victory over the Mounties as one of the
season highlights. Other high points included the two wins over state
rlval Coe, the season opening tournament victories, and the road win
over Cornell.

Strong individual performances earned Diekmann firstrteam all-
conference honors while Ed Brands was voted to the second team.
Diekmann led the team in scoring for the second straight year with 17.4
points per game. He also was the leading rebounder with nearly five a
game. Brands was the second~leading scorer with 12 points per game.
He led the team in blocked shots, with nine.

Threerpomt shooting was a forte for the Pioneers with five players
shooting over40%. Craig Studer made47/100 for47% to lead the team.
Todd Young was the assist leader for the third year in a row with 82.

Tony Brinsko is the lone senior, so the Pioneers will return 15
players. Young and Studer have been selected by the team as next year’s
captains. Arseneault hopes that with the right chemistry and leadership
next year could be “the season in which the team takes the step from
Simply being competitive to being playolfealiber."
