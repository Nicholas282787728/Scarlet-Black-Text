The business management 01 todM's
paper is in the hands of C. c. Davis.
’10.

The recent action ot the Board oi
Trustees in giving othcial sanction to
the title "Grillilell College” is a uel-
conie one to the student body. To the
average student, the elaborate pro-
ccss which it has usually been ilecese
sary to go through in explaining to
one's friends without the educational
pale. that Iowa College is neither Iowa
State College at. Ames nor the State
University at Iowa City has not. been
an especially pleasing one nol‘ one es-
pecially conducive to the development
oi an adequate system of morals

The city papers have been carry-
ing on a more or less strenuous agir
tation looking toward a combination
“town and gown" observance of the
anniversary of the birth or Abraham
Lincoln on February 12th. This we
believe is a project which should meet
with the approval, not only ot the stu.
dent body, hut, as well, ot those in
whose hands it is to say whether or
not the College shall be a pal
pant in such an a'liair. The especial—
ly close relations which were csLal)»
lished between the town and the Cole
legs in the recent Endowment caur
paign, combined with the met that tbc
centeila"

anniversari- oi the great

Emancipalor's birth falls this )‘cal‘
would seem to more than justify the
expenditure oi time and eltort which

such an observance would call forth.

Under the auspices oi the v. w c.

to be established in Iowa College. Be-
ginning with this coming Thursday,
the ﬁrst day or the new semester, the
department “ill be open ever artotu

Committee Room or the Association
building.

The committee in Charge request
that all articles icund, and all notices
or lost articles be brought there at
that time. Aiter Thursday no such
notices will be left on the
Bulletin board.

The need of some such department

hope to make it systematic and or
