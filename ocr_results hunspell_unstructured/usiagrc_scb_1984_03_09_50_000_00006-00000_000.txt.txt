Catch-22

Based on Joseph Heller's novel, Mike Nichols “Catchrzz” (1970) is the
tale of Captai Yossarian and the surrealist insanity of Army lite during
World War II. This ambitious adaptation or a supposedly uniilmable
book is an immense physical production which never neutralizes the ap
pealing personal comedy.

The iilm begins in a United states Air Force base on the tiny Mediterr
ranean island oi Pianosa where Captian Yossarlan (Alan Arkin) is in a
state oi perpetual epic panic For Yossarian. a willing convert to
paranoia, panic is a kind oi Nirvana. Most ot the iilm is iramed by
Yossarian’s delirium which results alter he has been stabbed by what
appears to be a German Pow. Yossarian is now convinced that
everyone wants him dead _ irom the Germans to his tellow oiticers
Because mankind is conspiring in his death and he wants to survive.
Yossarian knows that the whole world is crazy and he's absolutely right.
Yossarian's panic emerges as something important. reasonable, and
moving.

Nichol’s third iilm, “Catch-22" injects such comic conventions as ex-
aggeration. iantasy. and an insult and reverse logic into the movie's narr
rative line which is shaped into the [orm oi iunriy and sad blackout
sketches The iilm is loaded with controlled comic periormances,
especially that oi Arkin who portrays Yossarian with such deadly
serious intensity and intelligence that he is both iunny and heroic at the
same time. “Catclrzz” like Yossarian is almost beside itseli with panic
because it grieves tor the human condition. This epic human comedy will
be shown Saturday. March 10 at 10:15 pm. in ARH and Sullda). March It
at 7:00 0.11). in ARH.121 min. '

Breathless

Jim McBride’S “Breathless” (1983) is about two people who are cons
stantly misconnecting because they are a classic opposition oi
characters: a man who acts without thinking and a girl who thinks too
much This American remake oi Jean-Luc 'Godard’s French film
“Breathless", which is the cornerstone oi French New Wave and one oi
the most inﬂuential of all foreign films, has much to recommend: an
abundance of little-known talent, a sort oi punk spunk, and good old
American know-how.

McBride's “Breathless" takes place in has Angeles with Richard Gere
playing a dumb, crazy punk who worships the rock singer Jerry Lee
Lewis, whose music which is about sex, breaking through inhibitions.
and surrendering to the explosive torces inside you, has proioundiy ins
iluenced and shaped Gere’s character in the movie. Gere steals a Cari
kills a highway patrolman without really meaning to, and then goes on
the lam with a French architect/student studying in this country, who is
played by French actress Valerie Kaprisky. wild action and bold, erotic
scenes follow until Kaprisky betrays her lover to the police. seemingly to
assert the ascendancy oi middieclass values over steaming sexual im-
pulse.

The director and co-author. Jim McBride, is a product of independent
films who made his name with such movies as the underground cult
classic “David Holtzman’s Diary," “Breathless" is his iirst Hollywood
venture, and while it is not as innovative and fresh as the original, it is
more emotional and passionate with a compulsive drive and energy
which forces the audience to judge the film on its own terms. This enters
taining hommage can be seen Friday (tonight). March 9 at 9:30 pm. in
sL anti Sunday. March ii at 9 print in SL. 115 min.

Rockers

_ For all you reggae fans out there, the Jamaican film ”Rockers” (1978)
is the iilm to see this weekend. Featuring a superior score. including the
music of Bunny Wailer, Burning Spear, Peter Tosh, and Jacob Miller.
“Rockers" explores the hard world oi Jamaican Reggae music and
culture.

Horsemouth (Leroy Wallace) lives lackadaisically in Kingston and
works as a drummer, when he works. The Jamaican music business,
which is portrayed here as totally wicked, doesn‘t pay much heed to
Horsemouth‘s drumming talents. In order to supplement his meager in-
come, Horsemouth distributes records irom the pressing plant to the
stores; however, he only makes 25 cents a disc. Through it all,
Horsemouth simply shrugs and enjoys himself iiguring that he’ll get
even eventually, which he does in the film's merry concluding se-
quences.

Most of Horsemouth’s Rasmfarian friends are played by reggae musi-
cians — rockers is another name for reggae — and their songs are in-
tegrated very deitly into the action oi the iilm. The best example is a
scene in which the late Jacob Miller and his Inner Circle band are seen
performing a deceptively gentle song about burning down a plantation.
When the camera pulls back, the band is seen playing ior Wealthy white
tourists, who don't have the slightest idea what the music is about.

The deep ieeling “Rockers" has for Jamaican culture which is keenly
and vividly etched during the course of the film is all the more
remarkable since the movie‘s writer and director, Theodoros
Bali‘aloukos. is Greek..This reggae musical adventure will show Fri ay
(tonight), March 9 at 9 ﬂ p‘rrn.‘iri ARM and Saturday, March it) at 7:30
