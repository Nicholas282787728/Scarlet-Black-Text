Football Sundays

Armchair quarterbacks invade lounges

by Danny Kadden

Although the lrightening new
emphasis on studying this year has
seen increasing numbers of book
readers occupying dorm lounges at
all hours or the day and night,
Sunday still seems to be the TV
football day in and around campus.

It is televised football which
lures dozens of students from their
studies every Sunday. A
microcosm of “real" society, our
student body, realizing the im-
minence of middle age, is quick to
seize an opportunity to practice the
art of armchair sports.

SO. JUST LIKE their older
comrades in suburban dens across
the nation, many Grinnellians are
also enticed by televised gridiron
combat Surely most sociologists
would find this behavior
illuminating.

The ritual begins when students
filter into thelounges after lunch to
begin watching pre-game shows,
browse through the paper and chat
with fellow aficionados, Those who
wish to study realize immediately
that they must go elsewhcre.

The lounge is empty. Beer cans

questionable calls- led to
Marycrest’s sudden victory.

Coach Arthur Peterson was
pleased with the team's caliber of
play but was disappointed that
Grinnell did not emerge victorious,
He believes they clearly played a
better game ihan Marycrest. “We
settled down the second night," he
said, ”and played a good ball
game.”

Considering that Marycrest

nearly 30 points last season
Peterson felt that the Pioneers had
improved since the previous year.

“I've the feeling we’ll be more
competitive with better teams," he
said, “as long as we stay within the
format of team play,"

Scoring in the first game was
evenly distributed Roger Warner
and Frank Orth tied for the team
lead with 12 points. Pat Walsh
topped all Grinnell scorers with 27
points against Marycrest, and the
rest of the scoring was divided
among several other players
