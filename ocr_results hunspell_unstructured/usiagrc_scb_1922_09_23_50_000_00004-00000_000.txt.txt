Miss Andersen Writes
To Girls of the W. A. A.

(Continued from last issue.)

Another real treat was when We
saw Gluck’s Opera “Orpheus” given in

- the grounds of Warwick Castle, and
- produced by 500 people from the cams

munlty, ndcr the directorship of Mr.
Louis Parker, the great English Pag-
ozmt Master. You may be sure the
I counted mysell most fortunate to be
there just at that time. The opera

was given [or four days, and was at-i

‘tendeil by enormous adiences. The
music was exquisite, and the costumes.
all or which were made by the women
oi the down, were gorgeous. or course
the wonderinl setting of the castle
grounds, added greatly to the beauty
or the periormance and gave it the
right atmosphere. After the per-torm—
once, I had a chat with Mr. Parker, 3.

where the 500 participants were hav-
ing tea and sandwiches during their
three-quarters ot an hour between
performances, and be was so interest~
ed in hearing of the work which is
being done in the various cplnmunitlee
in America. Miss Long and I greatly
enjoyed the museums and galleries in
London, the only trouble being that
we ielt too hurried, doubtless the feels
ing which every tourist has. We were
tascinated with the old part or Lon-
don—too Dickens section, with the
unusual things which one sees there,
and with the London of Alired Noyes
We spent a day at Hampton Court
and Stone Pages, where Greys Elegy
was written—then on to Oxford, where
we went through the various colleges,

also saw Ruskin‘s home at Coniston.
From there We went by Coach, boat
and train to Melrose End Dryburgh

ml estate of Sir Walter Scott, full of
his books, pictures and relies. Next
came Edinburghia city run or inter-

whom we met, and with the English
lcountryside—the hedgerows and lanes,
the cottages and lovely flower gar—
ldcns. After six weeks in England
and Scotland, we crossed the North
Sea for Bergen, Norway. The ten
days among the Fjords and in Chris»
iliauin, I shall always remember as
being beyond description, 7 brilliant
Esunshine through the day and a full
‘moon at night.

We took long mc‘tor trips through
,wonderrui valleys, the road winding
‘nhont like a snail, great water rails
:(dozens of them) at every turn, dash~
ling down from Cliffs a mile high, tiny
(arms nestled in the valley or perched
on the steep mountain side, and many
peasant women at work in the acids.
We took coach rides Where it was too
steep tor a motor. and walked when it
was too steep for the horses.
many boat trips, winding about
through the Fjords, high cliris tower—
ing close by, and great snow—capped
rountain peaks high above us.

One of our best trips was a tour—
hour ride in s “stulekjerre”, a queer
Norwegian pony cart (two wheeled),
the driver sitting on a small high scat
behind us. He could neither speak
nor understand English, but I sur—
mise that he was amused at our many
"Oh: and ribs“, for words failed us.
You must go to Norway! The scen»
ery is similar to our Canadian Bock—
ies, only is more intimate,and has the
armed charm of the quaint village life.
At the hotels, the waitresses were in
the national costumes‘and so were
very picturesque. We slept between
feather beds, and had much Hardanger
Embroidery on the homespun bed
linen. Christinia and Copenhagen ere
beautilul cities, and we saw traces of
the old Viking civilization, especially
in Christiana

In Copenhagen we have heard some
line orchestra concerts for 25 c and
I have never seen more quiet and ap-
preciativeaudiences. When the or-
chestra began playing Faust Ballet
a part of which we used in “Pandora,”
II could hardly sit still, Copenhagen
is a great art and musical center, and
the museums there are very ﬁne. We
return to Copenhagen in a few days.
and then go to Holland, Belgium, Ger—
many and Oberammergua.

We are to he at the Passion Play
on Sept 17, and are fortunate in‘ be—
ing able to secure rooms in the home
of Anton Lang (Cbristus). We then
go to Switzerland, Paris and Italy,

The summer has gone quickly,
Ior the days have been run to the
‘brim. It is hard to realize that the
campus will soon be a busy placc~
my thoughts will be with you, even
though I am seeing so much that is
interesting and wonderful, and I shall
be eager to hear about Crinncll. I
,intcnded to write just a note or greet-
ing for the opening or the college
year, but my enthusiasm over the
summer has kept my pen moving.
