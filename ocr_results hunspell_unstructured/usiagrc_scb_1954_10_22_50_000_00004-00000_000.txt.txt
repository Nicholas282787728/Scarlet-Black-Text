it be given due time.

The freshmen in this institu—
tution are treated with more res
speot and consideration by the
sophomores and upperclassm‘en
than in any other college or
university that we know or. In
' most places the first year menl
are compelled to wear green
caps from the time of the fuss
football game until the spring
recess, Various other restrictions,‘
sensible or otherwise, are 'im—
posed upon them, They are pad-
dled and hazcd in many ways
by everv man in the three up-'
per classes.

But here in Grinnell every
means of helping the new stu'da
ours is employed and the upper»
classinen try to make the fresh—
men feel at home in their new
surroundings. .We have very

.few traditions or customs that
must be obeyed by the Fresh»
.men, and one or these'is the
proper conduct in the chapel
servrce. ,

in the ﬁrst place do not ape
plaud anyone or any perform-
ance in the chapel except in
rare cases, and in these cases
the seniors will take the initia
live. And in the second place,
,the ii-eshinen must remain seat-
ed and in their places until the
members or the three upper-
classes have passed out or the
building. This custom was 3117
pounced from the chapel plats
form the first dew and it hasl
never 'been' recoglrled by the,l
new class and has been espec-‘
daily ignored by the new men.

This is a serious inatier and
every treshman should think
about it [or it is up to every
member of the freshman class to
see that these customs are car—l
