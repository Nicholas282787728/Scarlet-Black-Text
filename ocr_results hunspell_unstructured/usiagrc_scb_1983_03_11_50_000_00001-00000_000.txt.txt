JB decides to
stay together

by June Kauiuian

The announcement of Jon Scharil‘ and
Pete Hautzinger as president and vice
president oi SGA Joint Board opened
Wednesday night’s Joint Board meeting,

A proposal before the Committee on Stu»
dent Life concerning student advisor study
break funding was discussed extensively,
but not voted upon. SGA president John
Moi'fett explained the recommendation,
saying that it would “pool the resident ads
visor study break money with iacuity
study break money.”

In opposition to the proposal, Pete i-iaut-
zinger, Haines Hall president argued, “it
seems to me that hall funds should be
spent on ﬁlings for the whole hall.”

Also speaking against the recommenda-
tion, Loose Hall President Peder Fretheim
said. “We may get more social integration
on tile floor, but the hall unity would
suite t would really be a pity if future
genera ions of Grinnell Students miss Bob
Cadmus' slides of the stars."

Vic Rudolph brought a resolution l'or-
ward for discussion proposing the disband-
ment of JB and the establishment of six
popularly-elected positions oi the cabinet.
He defended his proposal, stating, “As a
whole Joint Board isn‘t really represen-
tative government. ,..Student interest still
[would be] served, they [would] go and
voice their interests themselves rather
than mrough a hall pmident.“

All JB members speaking on the resolu-
tion opposed the concept. Hautzinger
stated, “.13 hasn't always been as ineffec-

tive as it is now. Face it. There are a lot of ‘

students on campus who don’t give a damn
about campus activities, and they deserve
to be represented."

Eric Fisher, Langan Hall president,
claimed, “in order to make changes,
students must elect officers. 1 would hope
that we could find more equitable means to
change than by disbanding .13.”

Steve Boyd, substiting tor Cleveland
President Ron Hankey asserted that, ”I
would not seek them [the cabinet
members] out. i see my president every
day. in general, rm not in tavor of
legislative suicide."

Discussion ended, and no vote was taken
on the proposal.

The Casino Night Budget of $513.41 was
approved.

Telethon totals
big bucks

by Jeff Ruyuuiiid

The 1933 spring telethon has been, accor-
ding to telethon co—coordinator Chris
Murner, the most successful spring event
ever. The student callers collected a whop~
ping 384.083, almost three times the
amount raised at last year's spring
teletllon.

The amount collected in the recently
concluded drive brings the total amount
raised in this academic year, by the two
teletllons, to $182,049, well above last
year’s total of $119,874.

There was, however, a sharp drop in
donars for the SGA trust fund. The $673
represents a 334 percent drop from last
spring’s telethon, which garnered $2,922.
Over $3,600 was raised for the fund this
past iail.

Murner stated that the reason for the
poor donation response was due to a lack or
cooperation from SGA members, who did
not show up regularly enough to make the
calls to potential donors. He said that the
telethon committe was prepared for the
SGA callers, but not enough people made it
to the phones,

“We hope in the future to be able, with
sons help, to turn this figure around,"
Murner said.

Class-night dance policy
irks concerts chair

by Nancy L. Radermccller

The Shakin' Pyramids are long gone, but
controversy surrounding their'weeknight
dance concert still persists. The announce-
ment of an administrative policy pres
hibiting class-night dances at last weeks’s
Joint Board meeting has sparked a lively
debate regarding the administration‘s pro
cedure in implementing the rule, as well as
the validity of die reasoning which
underlies their position.

while the policy was only announced last
week, Dean of Student Affairs Jim Teder-
man maintains that the rule has been in ef-
fect as an “unwritten" policy for the past
twenty years.

Explaining the reasoning behind the
policy, Tederman stated, “Given that
we’re an academic institution, [the college
should not] through its monies and
iacilities support events during the week
that are not conductive to academic pur-
suits.” The length oi the dances as well as
the use or alcohol which may accompany
such events were also cited by Tederman
as possible negative effects of such class
night concerts,

Commenting on the possibility oi such
consequences, Concerts Committe
chairperson Daniel Klatz stated, “Could
be, but I wouldn't say so.” He further add-
ed, “The alcohol problem on this campus
is an issue that should be addressed in-
dependently; events don’t cause people to
drink.”

Klatz also voiced objections to the man
ner in which the policy was made public,
commenting, “it may have been a policy,
but only Mr. Tederman seems to have
known about it.”

Furthermore, in response to
Tederman's assertion that he was
unaware of the Shakin' Pyramids' ap-
pearance prior to their periormance, Klatz
claimed, “That sounds strange to me.
Somebody in the Office 0i Student Affairs
should have known about the event; it was
in the Scarlet and Black the week before
and was very publicized.”

Klatz further contends that “The propos-

ed policy expiicidy deals with the issue ot a .

dance and not other forms of entertain-
ment such as films, concerts, public events
or nonacademic lectures," and that "A

 

value judgement regarding a dance seems
to he rather dangerous.”

Other complaints voiced by Klatz ins
ciude the absoluteness oi me policy, which
does not allow the committee to book class-
night concerts for a special event, as in the
case of the Shakin’ Pyramids, who could
not be booked at any other time. According
to Klatz, who maintains that several classA
night concerts have been scheduled in the
past, the committee has ,“never abused
this privilege, and there is, therefore, no
need tor a policy.”

He added that the Shakin‘ Pyramids
dance was explicitly billed as a “study
break dance," and that their performance
ended at 11:40, thus lasting only one hour
and 25 minutes.

Another point of disagreement is the
issue of funds used to pay for bands booked
by the SGA. While lunds appropriated by
ﬁle SGA come directly [mm the student
activities tees, Tederman maintains that,
because they are paid directly to the col-
lege, they are legally college monies which
”the SGA is allowed to administer.”

Countering this argument, Klatz stated
that “although they may ‘legally' be cola
lege funds, their placement on the tuition
is with the explicit understanding that they
are for the students to allocate as they
deem necessary and appropriate."

Because of the controversy surrounding
the policy, and because the policy was, ac-
cording to Tederman, formulated before
the creation of the Committee on Student
Lite, he has decided to submit the proposal
to SGA Vice Prsident Mark Bradshaw for
Consideration by the committee after spr~
ing break.

The CSL will then have the opportunity
to uphold or change the proposed policy
before sending it to Joint Board for ap-
proval. However, President Drake has
ultimate authority on the issue; he has the
right to Veto the SGA recommendation
should he iind it necessary.

Those bands not hired with SGA funds
are outside of the scope of the policy.
Weeknight dances in the Pub will,
therefore, be unaffected, although Teder—
man admits that, “This is an activity that
the Pub does...that personally i don't sup»
port."
