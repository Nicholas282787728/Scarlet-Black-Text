Lake Forest Overpowers Grinnell

By Mike Patterson

The Grinnell Pioneer football
team opened their 1990 season
Saturday with a disappointing loss
to Lake Forest. The Foresters used
their aggressive defense and bat;
anced offensive attack to defeat the
Pioneers 41-13.

The gamedid not start out badly
for Grinnell. Early in the first
quarter, quarterback Tim Hyde led
the Pioneers on an impressive drive
that ended with a 17-yard touch-

down passtoArmando Gilkes. Late
in the fourth quarter, Hyde also
connected with Gilkes fora43 yard
TD. Hyde, who is ﬁlling in for the
injured Jeremy Hawkinson, com
pleted loof 35 passes for 20a yards.
Gilkes ended the day with seven
receptions for l57 yards. Head
CoachGregWallaeeealledGilkes‘
performance “outstanding."

Soon afterGt-innell‘sﬁrstscote.
Lake Forest‘s powerful offense
began to roll. Talented receiver
Dan Cole ended the day with seven

catches for 145 yards. Forester
running back Steve Johnson was
equallysuccessful,carryingtheball
27 times for Bi yards and three
touchdowns When it was allover,
the Forester offense had amassed
521 yards oflotal offense This is a
surprising statistic considering the
strength of the Pioneer defense,

lake Forest "effectively used
therun toopen upthepassing lanes."
said Wallace. “We're still looking
for the right combinations on de-
lenser"

Ever since twoa-day practices
began weeks ago, the men‘s soccer
team hashad one goal in mind: to
repeat as conference champions.
The road to that goal will begin on
Saturday afternoon against the
team‘s first divisional opponent.
Monmouth.

Last season's match with Mon-
mouth was a physical game that
Grinnell won fairly easily White
Monmouth is usually not a con
tender for the division title, they
will undoubtablybe lookingto upset
the defending conference champi-
ons. The team is confidententering
theseason,andtheMonmouthgame
should reﬂect Pioneer pride.

Grinnell has trained harder this
year in preparation for a schedule
which includes six games in nine
days, The roster has been bolstered
by members of last year's junior
varsity squad and by three fresh-
men. The Pioneers could qualify
for the National Division III tour<
nament since the region has only
twenty-ﬁve teams. of which the top
four make the regional tournament.
