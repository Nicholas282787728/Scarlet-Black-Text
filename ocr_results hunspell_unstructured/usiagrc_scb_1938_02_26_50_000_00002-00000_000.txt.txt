TAKE ADVANTAGE

Among the many oft-forgotten cultural advantages of
Grinnell is the Carnegie music set in the music building
This set of records, unknown to many students, contains
Works of the greatest composers of all time, works which
are universally recognized as masterpieces

There are, we believe, many students on the campus
who are not afraid to admit a lilting for classical as well as
popular music. Both have their place ill the life} of a well
rounded person and to listen to either, to the exclusion of
the other, is to place a check on one’s own intellectual
growth

As a step, then, toward greater use of this equipment
which can add so much to your enjoyment, may we suggest
that persons sllollld take advantage of the Carnegie set
while they have a chancel

PROVIDING A sownorT

It has come to our attention recently that there is a
need on the campus £01 a place fol exhibits such as that
held by the Cameia club recently and that there is on the
other hand, a desile fol more exhibits of hobbies, photo—
graphs, stamps and models.

May we suggest that the White house is a logical

place for such exhibits to be held In its function as a stil-
dent uilion it should be a gathering place for alllthe stu»
dents, a place where such displays would be readily avail-

able.
To be sure there are difficulties, particularly the one

of limited space, yet we feel confident that some arrange-
ment could be worked out whereby the White house could
be advantageously used for this purpose

they Swear to obey 11 Duce's or-
ders without question, and to

Kctschnig stated that in spite
of the fact that the standard of
living has been lowered, the Ital-
ian laborer is satisfied because
he has been given social position
and leisure tnne.

Mussolini’s rhilosophy

Mussolini's philosophy, accord
ing to the spcakc1-, developed
from his early reading of such
authors as Nictvsche, Machiaveh,
Grace, and othc , and thus he
tended to a disd '11 for moral
values and the right of others. He
also has an unbounded admira-
tlon for force and cunning.
