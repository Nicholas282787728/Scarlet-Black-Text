- 7‘ Homecoming ConieSi Piis locals
‘ ‘ ‘ Against League Leading Knights

Tomorrow afternoon Gl'inllell‘s Pioneers tangle with
undefeated Carleton in the feature attraction of the Home
coming weekend. Not only will the Cal'ls be attempting to
move closer to the Midwest Conference crown but they will
be out to avenge last year’s 776 1053 to the Pioneers.

Gl'iilnell will be ’the popular favorite tomorrow but
comparative scores and statistics give the invaders a big

edge. So tar this season Carlev
ton has rolled over tour loop
opponents, nhile the Pioneers
are still socklng their first win
after two defeats and two has
Both Coe and 5t. Olat have fal-
lcn to the Knights as well as
Cornell and Knox. Grinnell tied
5t, Olai 13713 and lost to Coe.

»ci-inncll coach John ptitsch
thinks that his charges are liar
ble to pull anothcr surprise to
equal the deadlock with St clot
in their opener He says, "We're
as goud or better than Carleton
and the double incentive nf
homecoming and tnmg to win
our tirst one will help us."

Carleton has basically the
same squad that dropped labl
yeal“ close contest to ‘i‘ie Flo-
ncers plus a tow good sopho-
mores. Leading the Knight at~
tack will be sntit T quarterback
Bob Scott and soon iullhack
Bill Kelley.

Scott has completed 11 ot 34
passes in addition to handling
the option play very woll. Ber
hind Scott with Kelly \vlll be
Don Voss and captain Ted‘
sinebakkcn at the halves. These
three give theCai-ls a line rum
nillg attack along With Scott's,
aerials to provide a well bal-
anced oticnsivc attack.

To date, Carleton can thank
luck for a big part ot its tine
record since most of the breaks
seem to have gone their way.
The Cat-ls have beaten two ups
ponehts who have outgalned and
outdowned them, the case in
both the st. olat and Cue vici-
orics.
