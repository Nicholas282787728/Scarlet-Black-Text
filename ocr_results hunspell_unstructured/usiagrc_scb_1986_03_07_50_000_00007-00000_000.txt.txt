The Human Element

My dad used to have a lighter shaped
like a 7rup can, I remember when I was a
kid how it always sat on the third shelf of
the bookcase in the study and just...temp-
ted me. An out of reach instrument with
that kind of potential for destruction could
be powerfully seductive to a warped seven
year old with a fixation for things that
burned.

I was that type of kid.

Entire Saturdays Ispent lying in the sun,

Jun uncan
m’ y Belly pressed H—r—P‘at tot e warm concre e

driveway. With a magnifying glass held
poised at just the right angle, 1‘ would lie in
wait above the tiny black holes of ants and
other insects and fry the unsuspecting l‘tl'
critters until they either smoked, popped
or just curled up and crisped.

Sooner or later, I was going to find a way
to get my hands on that can.

I did.

When my parents arrived home from
work, i was in a sweaty panic.

“Jim, where did this come from?” my
mother asked, standing over a basketball-
sized burn in the middle of the study
carpet,

I shifted my weight from one leg to the
other and clench my hands nervously. “I
don't know,” I answered plaintively. I felt
the lie burning my ears,

She didn't believe me.

Months later, my sister Jennifer flipped
the channel on the tube and began to watch
the Mickey Mouse Club.

I had been watching Roadrunner. Iswit-
ched it back.

So did she.

I turned off the TV abruptly. She turned
it back on and sat down directly in front of
it, covering the dial with her hand.

Iwent nuts: screaming. jumping up and
down — the whole tantrum scene.

She watched the screen complacently,
smug.

I drew back to kick in the side of her
Skull,

Dad's voice suddenly boomed in my
head. “Don't you ever, ever, ever hit your
sister in anger!" He could sure scare the
pants off me, even when he wasn't actually
there,

My sister turned and sneered, taunting
me. She knew I couldn’t lay a finger on
her, for fear of losing my life. Her tongue
came out.

i broke, and fury took control. Wide-
eyed, my sister watched as 1 charged the
nearest breakable object I could find and
head-butted it. Her jaw dropped.

The window pane spiderwebbed and fell
in on itself.

“Jim, what happened here?" my mother
asked later, pointing at the hole where my
head had thrust through the glass.

“I don' know," I stammered. my head
downcast and my chin buried in my chest.
The lie burned my ears.

She didn't believe me.

Years later, I finailydid learn how to lie
effectively, but by that time it was for
entertainment rather than to actually
escape punishment.

When I came to Gfinnell, an up-
perclassman asked me. “So, just why did
you decide to live in the middle of the corn
fields of Iowa?"

“My dad found it cheaper to send me to
Grinnell than to keep me at home and feed
me,” I told him pokerfaced.

He believed me.

I lived off-campus last semester in Ran-
dom House...

“No!" Brenda said, her hand over her
mouth.

Totally seriously and without a trace of
amusement in my Voice, I asked, “What!
you don’t believe that I absolutely hate
Grinnell. that my parents are forcing me
to come here, and that the first chance I
get I'm going to flunk out, move to Denver
and enroll in the Institute for Automotive
Diesel Technology, and write horror
novels like Stephen King's on the side?"
The pitch in my voice rose slightly. “You
don’t think that it’s possible?" My eyes
narrowed and I added a touch of anger to
my words. Asking once more, with just the
right harshness, I drove the point home.
“You don‘t believe me?”

“Oh my God! " she Whispered in a shock»
ed voice, her eyes wilder now. “I think I
believe you!" She ran out of the living
room to tell her equally gullible room-
mate, Nicole.

For two days they tried to persuade me
out of my plan.

They had believed me.

I moved on campus ..

Some people are harder to lie to. John
was slightly skeptical, but more open
minded. when I told him that I had served
time in prison. ,

Grand theft auto. Four counts. He
almost bought it.

If only I hadn't told him that I did itfor a

lark,

He may have believe me.

For fall break I went home to Colorad

At 2 a.m., after a fourteen hour drive,
unlocked the front door and let myself in.
My parents weren’t expecting me.

“Jim, is that you?" my mother asked
from the top of the darkened stairs. She
was doubtlessly wielding a lethal curling
iron, to be used just in case it wasn‘t her
son come home from college.

“Yeah." I was tired.

For a middleaged woman with arthritis
creeping up in her joints, Mom bounded
down the ﬂight of steps with amazing agili-
ty. Rubbing his eyes and blinking in the
bright living room light, my balding father
followed with more caution,

She saw me and stopped short.

“Just what is that in your earl’!” she
asked sharply, with a tingeof something
less than joy in her words.

“Oh,'this'!" I toyed with the dangling ear
clip. The gaudy thing had been purchased
the day before, just for this occasion. ”I’ve
been wearing it for about a month. Like
it?" My face couldn’t have been any more
serious or honest.

She came forward and gave me a hesi»
tant hug. “No.” She took a step back and
her lace brightened. “You’re going to tell
me that this is a joke now, rightl’l”

No smile. N0 nod of affirmation, “Sorry
mom, this ﬁling’s for real." I waited for
the lie to burn my ears.

Her face fell.

Inside me, laughter boiled jubilantly.
My ears were unburnt.

She believed me.

Adventures in Economics

in the corner of my room stands the por-
tal to Possible Realities. One day, a tall
thin figure emerged through the portal.
“Mr Spock, the rational economist! ” I ex-
claimed, “Have you finally come to take
me to see your home planet now?” “Yes.
You will see all the wonders of Friedman,"
he replied.

Mike Cleary

We entered the portal and began to drift
through the ether. I asked, “Why do they
call it Friedman?” "That is the name of
the first inhabitant of the planet. Being all
alone with nothing else to do, he named the
planet after himself. When others arrived,
he gave us the motto “money is the
measure of all things." “How did he come
to Friedman?” Legend has it that he come
plained so much of government in-
terference in the economy that he grew un-
popular and was permanently exiled to the
private sector," Spock answered.

We arrived at the portal to Friedman
and stepped through. It was a bright white
landscape covered with graphs and equa-
tions. Sharp, black lines zigzagged in the
horizon, intersecting lines of red and blue.
“This was all barren once," said Spock.
“But we economists have developed this
land. We have grown bar graphs and built
theories to make this place even easier to
live in. The laws of economic science help
us, now that we understand them."

“We construct our theories by making
models of economic behavior and testing
them," said Spock. We walked up to a
large cage. On one side of the cage was a
vat of pancake syrup, on the other were

piles of “more" casserole In between, sat
an angry man. “We‘re testing his
preferences,” explained Spock.

“I want diapers!” said the man can
temptuously. “Don't be silly,” said an at
tendant, “You can’t have diapers. They
aren’t part of the model.” “The model.
Model! LET ME OUT OF THE
MODEL! 1 l ” screamed the man.

We walked to Spock‘s home, where I met
his wife. “What would you like to do
tonight, dear?” asked Spock. “I brought
my friend and l thoughtthat we could take
him to Equilibrium Point. Even though
we‘ve never been there, we‘ve heard so
much about it that it must be a wonderful
place,” Spock said optimistically.

“Well, i could derive enjoyment from
going there, but I might spend my time
more profitably by doing something else.
What do you think is my utility function,
dear?" replied Mrs. Spock.

“You can also decide on the basis of your
animal spirits. Consider the psychic cost,"
advised Spock. ‘,‘0h! You mean blind, rash
impulse! " she said enthusiastically.
“Well, sort of. I mean—" “What’s im-
pulse, dear?” she interrupted.

“Do what you drink is fun," 1 suggested.

“Fun?” they chorused.

How do you measure that?”

We finally decided to go together to the
planet archives. Mrs. Spock headed off by
herself. I picked out a book at random and
started reading. Spock, who had stared at
two books for the longest time and finally
could not choose between them, came over
to me. “You’re reading about the classical
agel Very interesting period. A significant
crisis was averted ill that time," said
Spock.

“All of a sudden, people were buying and
selling less. GNP kept falling and falling,”

“Well, it says here," I said, indicating a
page, “that there was a trend toward
bartering at about the same time,” “We
had to find a way to raise consumption and
quickly, before catastrophe occurred,"
Spock continued, excitedly. “People found
bartering quite efficient,\” l persisted.
“Zigwat production rose considerably and
services improved tremendously."

”The solution was to make more and
more money until people could buy more.
Consumption rose, more was produced to
meet the new demand. The statistics of
sales receipts and cash flow demonstrate
this remarkably wellt" chortled Spock,
“GNP was restored to its former levels
and the economy saved.”

“But bartering doesn’t use money at
all!” I protested, a little too loudly. A
librarian glared at me from behind her
desk and Spock asked What I was getting
so emotional about. I suggested that we
leave.

“That’s what I like about economics,”
said Spock as we walked past the main
desk. “It doesn't make any value
judgements. it just tells you what you have
to do to improve your situation."

We met Mrs. Spock at the door, “I just
remembered 7 is it too late to get my
typewriter fixed so that I can finish my
theory about distribution of goods?" she

'asked her husband. “They're closed by

now. But why do you want to go there? You
know they're always late and they don‘t do
a good job.” replied Spock. “Besides,
we’re still looking to find a good zigwat,"
he added.

1 had been feeling dizzier. The angular
landscape was an eyesore and i had trip
ped over a kinked demand curve. 1 said
that perhaps 1 had better return home.

“it has been very interesting and

bewildering. Even though you have shown
me a lot, I feel that I would understand this
place better after I have seen more," I
said.

“Does this place still confuse you?”
queried Spock. “i don‘t understand. It
seems quite clear and distinct to my
mind."

Something had bothered me for some
time but I was unable to express it. Spock
distracted me by speaking. “My second
purpose for visiting you was to ask your
help. We here in Friedman have learned
much and want to help you run your world.
Be my guide and let us go back to your
home world together. i will bring a rope
with which to attach our worlds.” The of-
fer seemed good but at the same time. I
felt bothered again. In my confusion, I
agreed.

Spock fetched a long coil of rope and
secured it just outside the portal. We
entered the portal and quickly began drif-
ting towards home. Spock’s rope trailed
behind him like an umbilical cord.

The ethereal winds picked up and we
began to drift apart. Spock struggled with
his rope and cried out for me to come back.
My momentum increased and I drifted
even further.

Suddenly, I realized what had been
bothering me. I called out, “What do you
think your models tell you about economic
behavior?" In the distance, Spock struggl-
ed to control his rope and looked up with a
puzzled expression on his face, “what do
your models tell you about human motiva-
tion’l” l yelled again, Then Spock was
gone.

~I did not know whether he heard my
question or not. 1 drifted back to the portal
and emerged into my room. i lay in bed
and stared at the ceiling for a long time.
