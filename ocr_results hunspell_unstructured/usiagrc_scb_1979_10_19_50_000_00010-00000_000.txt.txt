- , To most Americans, it is quite possi-

’ ble that the only exposure to rugby
they have had has been limited to
bumper stickers which read such
things as: “Rugby players eat their
dead.” or ”It takes leather balls to
play rugby.” But in tact, rugby is
becoming a highly accepted sport in
this country.

The spurt comes from Britain and
was iirst brought to this country
through the Ivy League schools. Con-
sequently, the trend moved to the west
coast and then finally to the Midwest.

“The United States Rugby Union IS
perhaps a half a million strong," said
Tom Hawbaker, who is a student
coach for the Crime“ Rugby Club.
”At Grinnell, there is quite an interest
in rugby," he said. “The team is
presently in its iiith year, playing two
seasons per yeariiall and spring.
Twenty players are out this fall, but
our big season is in the spring when
we draw the players trom the iootball
and soccer teams.“ Fortyrlive players
are expected this spring and, on the
average, the club will play 25 games.

“But despite the growing in-

together" after capping only two of 16
matches during the regular season.

club potentially races extinction, The
organization, the money, and the
coaching required to maintain a club
is tremendous." Hawbaker feels that
the Club must be transformed into a
team it it wants to remain in 6X7
istence.

The rugby club was iounded in 1975
by Bob Ovel, who lived in Grinnell but
taught at Lynnville»Sully High School.
When Ovel left Grinnell, the future of
the club rested in the hands of
students Peter St. Thomas, Hawbakel‘,
and Doug l3rower. These players have
all been trained in ioreign countries,
so they are proticient enough to coach.
St. Thomas, ior instance, played in
Ireland and South Africa; Hawbaker
played in Ceylon; while Brower
played in Indonesia. Club player Mike
Cetina said, “These players will not be
at Grinnell next year, so there will be
no one to do the real coaching."

Hawbaker says the club is “the
bastardrchild oi the PEG, and the
athletic faculty regards rugby as a
mere lad at Grinnell." Hawbakel'
adds that “because the rugby games
draw as many as 50100 people in the

[all and 100 to 200 in the spring, it is
inevitable that the club be more fully
recognized and accepted."

Hawbaker suspects that the basebal
coaches and the track coaches oppose
team status ior rugby because rugby
would draw valuable athletes away
from their teams.

As it is, the rugby club has been
denied money from Initiative Fund
because it is said that “the club offers
no service to the school," St. Thomas
says, “It is absurd that if 40 students
want money tor a party, they usually
get it, whereas the rugby club does
not.” Hawbaker said, “I wonder how
much the gay community receives,
We are bigger than they are and we
really need the money."

For the last three years since Ovel
left Grinnell, St, Thomas, Hawbaker,
and Brewer have given their time “to
setting up practices, games,
schedules, fundraisers, etc." They
and the other players have had to “get
permissmn to use the fields, lime the
fields, arrange overnight accommoda-
tions, and arrange and provide
transportation."

As for the money, the players have

“This is the game we’ve been point-
ing toward all season," notes Coach
John Plitsch as his soccer team
prepares tor a home encounter with
Knox tomorrow,

Game time is 3 p.m. at the Tenth
Avenue Held and the winner will
almost certainly go on to capture the
Midwest Conlerence Southern Division
crown. Knox, a perennial soccer
power, has copped eight straight divi-
sional titles and has not lost to Grin-
nell since 1974.

presently, Grinnell is 2-0 in con.
ference play and 7-2 overall this tall

last Saturday. Said Pfitsch, “We
played very well during the iirst 20
