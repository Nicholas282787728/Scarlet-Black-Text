Unfinished Business

After this year’s Student Council elections, we sug
gested that the Council separate the convention and presl
dential election by more than a mere clay. Since it was pos-
sible to nominate candidates on the convention floor, we
felt that it was undesirable to allow only oiie day for the
two finalists to make their positions clea'

We talked to members of the election board, and they

‘plained that this year they were experimenting and gropc
ing for the right actions. In addition, we received verbal
assurance that something would be done to enable next
year’s election board to benefit from this so-called expe
mentation. As yet, nothing has happened, for the board
has not met since election, but is unof cially defunct _

There is at present no continuity between election
boards it might very well be that next yeal’slboard will
have to experiment also. These perpetual experiments are
harmful to Student Council and the prestige of presidential
elections, for one never knows what will happen until the
election board sends out their decrees — three weeks be
for the election. _ _ .

This year's board should have many interesting obser-
vations to report. They should feel bound to report the out
come of their experiment and make some recommendations
in order to promote some continuity of elections. This
board should not merely fade out. as many student com-
mittees do, but should report now, while all its members

are still at Grinnell.

To the Editor:

All right . . who's the wise
guy on the staff responsibleifol‘
subjecting us, week after week,
in these ridiculous “Little Man
On Campus” cartoons? What’s
funny about them?

Since early in the semester,
when I first became' aware of
the Little Man, I have seen him
in such uncommon situations as
this: as shaking with unbe—
lievable velocity in the class-
room because he was to give a
speech; hanging a live woman
on the wall of his room and
referring to it as a new pin up;
and being amazed when his data
did not understand what he had
meant when he asked her to
play ball with him,

I hardly. need point out that
the Little Man is a complem
misfit, He has no appreciation
of the accepted social code Alf
his friends, no understanding
of ordinary amdemic proced-
urq and a slightly prcvcrtcd

, sense of humor.

The latest cartoon, however,
(April 27) certainly deserves
mention as one of the worst of
the series, (Professor sees pretty
girl.) I think the point of the
cartoon lies somewhere in the
men‘s reaction to the girl. Pain
haps the joke is in the word
‘distracting' in that we do not
usually think of pleasing sights
as being such; perhaps it is in
the cleaning bill that will come
in when the professor has his
jacket cleaned of chalk marks:
perhaps it is in the two idiot
boys with the thatched heads
whom we note at the right of the
picture.

And then perhaps ifs just
a. terrific joke an the student
body oi Grinnell, the joke he~

ing that such activities go on
frequently at other colleges,
whereas Grinnell is an interior
institution.

At any rate, 1 charge the edi-
torial staff of the $815 with
fraud, deliberate misrepresenta-
tion of campus standards, and a

'If you havie a driver's license,

you may be in demand. The

If you'already have an opera-

take a written test to obtain a

I have never seen any minv

records of these meeting should
be kept and passed on.

Where are those vital min-

SCARLET AND BLACK

Far From ‘

Customary
Skies

By Gene Thompson

(with Apologies to Ogden Nash)

The highway—widening coni-
lttec was told that there was
enough money to do a new high
way-widening Job, and that the
problem of choosing a place had
been put in their lap.

But since there were so maily

places that needed work done,
and since the committeemen
were Very busy, they just threw
a dart at the map.

”It’s settled, then," said the
chairman, a large, executive
lypc man with a cigar,

And since it was, indeed
settled, they picked up their
maps, diagrams, sliderules and
brief cases, and retired to the
he" ‘est bar. '

The Very next day, with a roar
that was less than tremendous,
but could certainly be classified
as more than a mere rumpus

Scores of trucks, tractors,
graders, dirtmovcrs and power
shovels converged on the
Grinnell college campus irom
all points of the compass. ,
As you've probably guessed
already, this multitude of! ma»
chinery was there for the one
sole purpose of widening high»
way six
At the expense of a few hun-
died shade trees and quite a
law square feet of our campus,
but then when one Is widening
highways, one doesn’t think
twice about some grass and a
few stix. ,

Now i m a good Iowan, and
as a good iowan, I am used to
having highways mm up all
around me, and i am used to
the sound of pavement break-
mg, '

So l have never been known
to gripe about a detour, really,
because it is airways the sign of
a new highway in the making.

1 suppose it isn’t really the
highway-widener’s fault that
Grinnell college is where it is —

We would probably be clo-
scr to the truth if we blamed,
it on somc founding father of
the past, and just let the wi-

Strand Shows “Romeo”

There will be a special show-
ing of “Romeo and Juliet” at
the Strand theater Wednesday
from 4 to 6 pm.

The movie, a J, Arthur Rani;
production, was filmed in Verr
oha, Italy, the original setting
of the play.

(Ieners get on with their biz,

or course they didn't look a-
head when they built the came
pus around a railroad track and
made the highway curve around
it. ior- course the layout was
badly planned.

But just wait about fifty years,
when they will find out that
there isn’t enough room on cam-
pus roofs for helicopters to land.
