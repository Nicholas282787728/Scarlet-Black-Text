GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
APluL 8, 1949

We Can’t Be Let Alone

In many ways fire is like yellow fever. It is a plague,
a pestilence, and must be treated as such. Yellow fever, at
one time a dreaded disease that ravaged a good part of the
South, did not fall victim to a wonder drug, but rather to
prophylaxis. lts source was discovered; sink-holes of pollu-
tion were scourged; havoc wraught with the cause Re—
sult? The disease vanished

This same method, prophylaxis, can be tlle answer as
well w the dread horror of fire here on the Grinnell cam-
pus and everywhere. We must make a concerted assault on
our Sink-holes of potential disaster.

The recent investigation by the Iowa Fire Prevention
Association is a step in the right direction. Publicity of the
results of that investigation through this paper is another
forward step. But the greater part of the attack must
necessarily rest in the hands of you, the student body.

It is obvious that technical fire prevention measures
have very definite monetary limitations. But the majority
of fires that occur in the country and have occurred on this
campus are the results of purely personal prevention faults.
We must center our attack on two of these in particular.
CARELESSNESS AND IGNORANCE. Carelessness is a
very human failing, but in the case of fire prevention the
word must be completely purged from our vocabularies.
Care must be the universal watchword. Fire extinguishers
are for putting out fires; you can’t beat an inferno into
submission with an empty extinguisher.‘ Waste baskets me
not ash trays; electrical circuits have pnysical capacity lim-

itations. _
Ignorance 01

011 e is intolerable. _ ~ _ _
guiﬁiging codes governing the specific constructions on this

campus. They are to be found in black and white‘in the

college book of rules and regulations.
The job before us is obviouslyho
gating committee, the administration,

It is for us all.
