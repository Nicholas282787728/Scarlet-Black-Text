Reviving Samuel Beckett

Bv KATHERINE MCMULLEN

A dark, silent stage. A burst of light, energy and_
sound. A head, emerging from a funeral urn. Then
darkness.

Famous for their thematical complexity, and per-
haps their inaccessibility, two of Samuel Beckett's
plays come to life this weekend.

The year 2006 marks the centennial of the birth
of Beckett, considered one of the greatest playwrights
of allrtime. This signiﬁcant celebration in the inter-
national theatrical community has compelled the
Grinnell College theatre community to host a C61,
ebration of its own.

"Because Grinncll has a tradition ofdoing Beckett
periodically, it was particularly important to celebrate
the centenary," said director Ellen Mease, Theatre.

Mease, working with three assistant directors, a
gnicsr lighting designer from New York, a gucst sct and
prop designer from Chicago and a cast of ten students
and one faculty member, has compiled a collection of
seven Beckett pieces to be performed in Roberts The-
ater Nov. 18720. The performances are in two parts:
Fmtm afthe Slat/l and Kmpp'r Larz Tape. Framer 0/
[be Shirl is composed ofs'ix short plays; “Play,"“Come
and Go,”“Not I,” “Footfalls,"“A Piece of Monologue”
and “Ohio Impromptu,"

“Each of the short plays follows chronologically

from the previous one, and the ultimate goal of the

whole evening is to show the way Beckett’s renewed
commitment to the aesthetic ofless is more has pro~
duced over the span of the composition of these plays,
highly unusual and very distinct, though thematically
very consistent, treatments of humanity on the cross.
It’s not an cvcning oflaughs,”Mease said.

Krupp} Lart Tape, a one man show performed by
Christopher Connelly, Theatre, in conjunction with
Fi'ermer afﬁrm Skull, takes viewers through one man’s
reﬂections upon the life he has led. Connelly, who
performed the role while in his early twenties, brings
to the part a greater understanding of the character.

“When I first did it all those milestones of aging
and anything else, life choices were way, way in the
future," Connelly said. “It’s very interesting to reﬂect
back on the aging process and the choices one makes
in life."

Beckett's works have presented a particular chair
lenge to the actors and directors.

“There’s a lot of difficulty. The texts are really
dense, and they’re difficult to memorize,” said assis-
tant director Brian Fritsch 'Oét “Trying to ﬁnd what's
really important to the text and set aside things we
know we can’t deal with has been a challenge."

“It’s not as accessible to young people who maybe
still haven't had the chance to experience human sufr
fering or old age or a lot of the themes that he’s talkr
ing about,"Noga Ashkenazi ’09, assistant director and

Theatrical activism ‘wa

BY SARAH MIRK

on Monday night, Kathy Cawthon ’08 hugged
her knees to her chest, awkwardly squeezed into
a student desk. “I woke up the next morning in my
room naked,” she said, hcr cycs glancing down to
the blue folder in her hand to read the line, Cawthon‘s
performance is part of this weekend‘s one-act activ-
ism, tucked away in Main Loungc.

The [justsex] sponsored staged reading of Until
Slimearze Wit/(er Up is a series of fictional narratives,
written by Macalester students but based off of actual
interviews with people who have experienced sexual
violence. The cast of four women and one man takes
on different roles in each scene, switching genders,
ages and, occasionally, from the role of victim in one
scene to rapist in the next.

Jenny Rosenbaum loo, director, encouraged her
performers to adopt the mindset of their characters,
This is diﬁicult in Unlil Someone Mic: Up, since most
of thc cast members are not experienced actors and
some of the characters are unsympathetic. Amanda
Slams ’07, former leader of the Feminist Action Cor
alition, had trouble playing the part of an insensitive
boyfriend who “just docs it" with his sobbing girlr
friend,

Exposing Grinnellians to different, difficult pert
spcctives is Rosenbaum‘s intention. She described the
performance as “theatrical activism theatre that
means something in a broader social context." Rose“,
baum believes that theatre has the power to have a
deeper emotional impact and be more personalized
than traditional modes otactivisrn, such as protesting
at the capitol building or staging a ﬁstrpumping rally,
Her cast agreed,

Theatre isnot a new medium for activism against
sexual violence. Amreness-mising plays such as T/ir
Virgina Marie/agile: havc been in vogue over the past
decade, informing audiences about traditionally taboo

subjects.

Theatre is a “way to bring [these difficult issues]
to them in a format that’s easy to deal with,” performr
er Kelsey Morse-Brown ’09 said.

“There are people who will go to set a play who
might put protestors out of their mind," Rosenbaun-i
said, adding that “everyone has to sit through that Sex
Signals production” This reading is meant to cover
all the aspccts ofscx that people don't normally cone
sidcr.

According to those involved in the reading, Grinr
nellians needs a little provocation to think about sex-
ual Violence more in their own lives.

"Grinnell is definitely not above needing this
play," Slatus said. “People still don’t want to admit that
it happens here.”

Writtcn by students at one of Griiiiicll's peer
colleges, Unli/ Someone Wit/m Up acknowledges that
sexual WOlCnCC can and does occur, even on camr
puses whcrc its not generally considered a problem.
The show is meant to foster an environment where
students can feel comfortable and safe talking about
these often awkward issues.

Alison Oldhani ‘07 noted that “people do talk
about things in this abstract academic setting" but
don't take the next step ofpractical changc, Oldham
hopcd that the performance would help change an arr
mospheie that makes rape more socially acceptable,
making people think twice hcforc they make snide
comments related to rape or promiscuity.

Slams believes that snidents at campuses like
Grinnell don't talk about sexual violence, in part bcr
cause of thc “small-campus syndrome; no one says
anything that you wouldn’t want the whole campus to
know" This play is an act of protest against the idea
that Grinnell is impervious to sexual violence. “We're
too ‘enlightened,"' Slams said. “Until we admit that
it's not completely safe, it's never going to be.”

I Two performances celebrate the
' centennial of author’s birth

member ofthe Samuel Beckett Society, said.

Hours of study and rehearsal have gone into un-
derstanding and upholding the reflective mood of
Beckett's Farmer oft)” Skull and Kmpp's Lari Tape
Grinnell actors and directors have tried to convey
Beckett’s wisdom and insight into the human condi-
tion.

Though the mood and message have bccn painse
takingly maintained by actors and directors, Beckett’s
compositions still present a challenge to viewers.
Beckett does not convey his message with the sim-
plicity and merriment some have come to expect in
theatrical productions

“When people first start approaching Beckett’s
works, it seems inaccessible. It seems dense. It seems
very intellectual. It is all those things,” said Connelly
“I think students and actors get that, can appreciate
that intellectual connection, but it's hard to get that
emotional connection to these characters because
they seem so non—realistic and such an alien to the
way we live our lives. But Beckett is stripping away a
lot otthc cxternals of Life to got to those cores, those
essences of truth about what it means to be alive."

“I think that if anyone comes to see the show they
should try their best to look beyond the sparscness
and apparent pessimism just to find that humanity
and humor that is there," said Fritsch, “even though
it's maybe difficult to see at first glance."
