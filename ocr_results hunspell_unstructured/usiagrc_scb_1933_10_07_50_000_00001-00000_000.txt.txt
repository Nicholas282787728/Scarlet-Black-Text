Tentative Games Arranged
With Three Teams

Although the number of freshman
football candidates reporting at pres-
ent is hardly half that of the average
prep squads in the past, John c.
Truesdale, fresh coach, believes that
the quality measures up very well.
About 20 athletes have been report“-
ing for daily practice so far,

Coach Truesdale hesitated to indi-
cate the outstanding men on the
squad, saying that premature predic-
tions were too likely to be unfair to
men whose abi ty has not yet been}
tried. He mentioned, however, that
several good centers are among the
candidates.

lore of the quadrangle.

Pioneers thoroughly outplayed the
visitors, although the ball see-sawed

lback and forth, featuring the kick-

ing of Carson and Henningsen. Car-
son's punts averaged 38 yards,
gaining a great deal of distance by
a peculiar twisting bounce and leap
forward. On two occasions he placed
the ball out of bounds on the 3-yard
line.
Pioneers Desperate

Early in the third quarter the
Pioneers started a march featuring
gains by Clark, a twisting‘ 12-yard
run by Kingery, and plunges by Rose.
This onslaught was halted when
Kimberlin intercepted a pass, ,but
the Pioneers soon regained posses-
sion of the ball and this time did
not stop until they had reached the
4-yard line. Here the Tutors bristled
and Grinnell lost the ball on downs.
