This week, however, Rocdigcr spoke about
“The House I Live in: New Immigrants, Race
and the Dilemma ofAnti»Racism in a Short
\Norld War II Film," The talk was Centered
on a 10 minute film featuring Frank Sinatra.
The film was shown to a nearly-packed house
in Behring-Lewis Auditorium after Rocdigcr
gave a brief introduction.

occasional laughter rippled through the
auditorium as the audience watched a young
Frank Sinatra lecture a group ofyoung boys
about religious tolerance and eventually cmon
“nil laces and religions, that's America to me."
The climax of the short film, and the focus of
Roetligei's tallt, \vlls the song "The House I
Live In.”

Ho had planned to include the movie in
the conclusion ot hls book as an example of
pos \lc anti-raosni work by othnie whites.
After ht: watched it, though, he decided that
the ﬁlm was {at more problematic than he "Mid
first assumed.

He also considered the ﬁlm in the COHIEXI
of Sinatra‘s little-publicized “pm-tolerance
talks“ given around the country, rnany ofwhich
were met with antagonism by ethnic \ itcs.

He referred to the short ﬁlm as an “inverted
mi nstiol show,"and explored how “an all-white
cast in a ﬁlm against religious intolerance" has
been viewed as anti'mcist by historians.

Though colwocntions are less frequent this
year, this talk spurred several other events this
week.
