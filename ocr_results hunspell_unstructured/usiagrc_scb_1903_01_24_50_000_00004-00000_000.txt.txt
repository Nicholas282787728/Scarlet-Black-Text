MINNESOTA GAME.

On Thursday evening the Grin-
nell basket ball team mct the
University ol’ Mlllnesula team at
thc Armon and was defeatth by
a score ol 37 to 2

The ﬁnal of the basket ball
grounds was waxed and was as
smooth as glass. Grinnell men
were not allowed to use rosin on
tlieirslloes and were unable to
startqulckly or stop when they
did get started. Minnesoia had
been provided with shoes espe~
cially adapted to the ﬂour and
therefore had a great advantage.

For about ﬁve minutes at the
start oi the game neither side
scored and it looked as though
the game would be close, Then
Minnesota started to score and
piled up thirty-seven points.
Grinnell's only two points were
made by two baskets from fouls
by Captain Wilson.

The Minnesota team is certain
ly a fast aggregation on their own
grounds but on grounds which are
nearer regulation size and with
secure looting for the players it
is sate to say there would he a
different tale to tell. All of their
men played good team work and
showed the results olgood coach.
mg. Captain During and Tuck
especially disimguishiue them-
selves. For Grinnell the whole
