jUNlOR PROGRAM AT CALOCA

Friday afternoon the Junior girls
entertained the other members of the
Calieogathian Society with a clever
mlnstrel show. The sixteen girls were
dressed in appropriate costumes which
enhanced the dusky shades of their
faces and their ivooly locks, The en-
tire company marched in by twos and
rendered “At De Golden l‘r’eflding" in
full chorus for the ﬁrst number of
their program. Charra Currie as “Miss
Johnson" was interiocntor and Verna
Chase and Pearl Hart were “endemen. ”
The parts were well taken and the
jokes mostly local hits were much ap-
preciated by the audience. Theseeond
number \vﬂsa song by Verna Chase,
“Shame on You", assisted by the com
pany in the chorus. This was iollow.
ed by a dance by Pearl Hurt. which was
heartily encored. Grace Hill and Ed—
ne Edmunds, assisted by the company
gave “G0 to Sleep Ma Honey” and
Edna Sears as “Lulu Snowball” sung
“Ma Honey Lou” in true minstrel
fashion. One of the most enjoyable
numbers) was the reading of one of
“Paul Lawrence Dunbar’s lyrical
“Eagles” by Mrs. Dunbar, otherwise
Laura. Withington. This was follow-
ed by “Take me back to Baltimore”
by Verna chase and a dance by Grace
Hill andJessie McMurr-cy. A grand
cake-walk by eight members of the
company and a full chorus of ”Mussa‘s
in do cold cold ground” closer] the per-
fol'lnance. The dusky maidens ﬁled
oil" the stage singing "I Wish ma cuiah
would iade.” The entire program
was clever, entertaining and fully up
to the usual standard of the class of
190“.

Thursday‘s basket ball game at the
Rand Gymnasium resulted in a victory
tor the girls or 1901, who by delcating
(he juniors have won for the second
time the college championship. The
contest was held in the presence of a
large audience, consisting altogether
of ladies and it goes on record as one
01' the most excmng ever held in the
building, the score being 91 to S. The
margin at one time \vusin favor of
the juniors and the result was Wholly
in doubt until the very last minute of
play. It isa matter of common remark
among the spectators of this game,
that the quality of baslret ball played
by the women or Iowa college has im-
proved substantially every year since
the sport was introduced. The Soph»
omore team was composed of the ini-
lowing players: Ruth Rabbltt. Beth
Amos, Hester Carter. Alice Grimm)
Jessie Wolllhuter and Litta Ladd.
The Junior players were: Edna. Ed»

the muster-pieces of modern American
ﬁction and admirably suited to in.

The arrangement used was heavy and

her brilliant interpretation or ”The

The ﬁrst part or the program con-
sisted of a number of short poems and
selections, thc Extract from "The

being the longest. To some of the
most common and simple short poems
she gave a new and deeper signiﬁr
ceoce. This part. oftlie program lost
much in elIect by the confusion by
many late arrivals. These many have
been due to the fact that, owing to a
late train, Mrs. Beecher was unable
to begin the recital on time, and
several lei‘t during the delay, butar,
an entertainment of this sort tardi-

Judging trom the large audience
which lined the church and the gener-

Mrs. Beecher would be as warmly
welcomed should she give a third
Grinncll recital.

MR. AMES ADDRESSES STUDENTS.

Yesterday morning in chapel the
students enjoyed the privilege of
listening to a man who has attempted
to accomplish something tangible in
the way of political and economic re-

almost every movement in Iowa [or

prosperity. He has been especially
interested in railroad questions and

the talk in chapel was upon the re»
bate evil.

Mr. Ames brieﬂy deﬁned rebates as
being the restitution of 3 portion of
the freight rates to the shipper as an
inducement {or his continued patron-

PROFESSOR MACY’S LATEST

Books dealing with the history and
government of Iowa are not so numer-
ons that. a new one should be allowed
to pass unnoticed. “The Government
of Iowa: A Text Book for Iowa
Schools,” has recently made its ap—
pearance, the joint work of Jesse
Macy, professor of constitutional his;
Cory and political economy in Iowa,
College, and Karl IT. Geiser. professor
of political science in the Iowa State
Normal school.

The new volume is based on Profes-
sor Macy’s well known “Iowa. Govern-
ment,” to which much new material
has been added, bringing the constis
tutionnl and legislative history of the
state down to date. The authors
seem to have kept constantly in mind
the needs 0! Iowa. school teachers and
students. The origin and the history
ofciril government in Iowa ere ade-
quately tleuied and the relation of
the citizen to the various govern~
mental units is car-chilly explained.

Iowa has had several volumes of
history published Within recent years.
Some lime been so condensed as to
be little more than indexes to the
study which thereader must pursue
elsewhere. Others have been so elab-
orate as to weary with unnecessary
detail. The present volume devotes
but little space to the state’s history,
but in concise rorrn tabulates the gov-
ernmental remilations.

High school students are taught of
the United States government; and ae-
quire a great mass of more or less use-

ful irrior-ination concerning the devel-
opement and government of foreign
nations. The present volume supple-
ments that instruction by familiariz—
ing them with the story of their own
state. with the conditions or which
they must become acquainted sooner
