Faculty Votes-

tContlnued from page 1)

majonly vote of the faculty is
similar to the present system, but
the time devoted to speaking will
be shortened," Dr. Canard said
last night. ,

“The services may include a
Scripture reading if the faculty
leader desires, but this is optlom
all," he further explained.

Library to Remain Open,

Also, accoiding to the program
the library will remain open for
die use of those students who de-
sire to study. During the past
few years the library has been;
closed during the chapel hour, but]
the new plan reverts back to thel
method followed a number 01'
years ago when the library was
left open.

The new program is scheduled
to become effective Monday‘
morning, and the last two chapels,
under the old program will be'
devoted to explaining the new
proposal.

Monthly Convocation.

Also, according to the program,
monthly convocation will be held,
at which time worthwhile speak-i
ers will talk. or important dis-l
cussions will be held. Postersl

will be placed on all bulletin;

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

boards advertising the Vespers
speaker and the chapel prograinl
for the next week. All hall and
cottage officials are being asked
to cooperate in trying to increase,

chapel attendance. l‘

When asked what caused the
sudden discussion of the chapel
question, Dr Canard explained
that the problem was taken up
because of the small attendance
at the opening chapels of the year
and at the first convocation,

Special Committee Named.

Because of this condition
special committee was appointedl
last week by Pres. John S. Noncn,1

i

l

and has bccn working on thel
problem since then, according to‘
Dr Conard Committee members‘
were‘ Dr. Conard, chairman: L,
T. Sherman, faculty representa-K
tiivc; Baxter smith and Betty
Carries, Student council chapel

leomnnttce. Alien Rossman, presi-

dent ol the Student council; John
Buckley, president of the Council
of House Presidents; Marlanl
Bair, president of the Women's
Self-Government association; Law
rence Upton, president of the
Young Men’s Christian associa-
tion; Nancy Griffin, president of
the Young Women's Christian
association; Miss Evelyn Gardner.
dean of women; and Shelton L.
Beatty. dean of men.

in commenting upon the rumors
that the new plan was designed
for other purposes than to stimu-
late an interest in chapel, Dr.
Conard said, “Whatever else you
may have heard or thought, the
discussion began with our reali-
zation that attendance at Chapel
smrted out this year at an un-
precedentedly low ebb, When the
president's committee met, we

'found various other issues were

involved. for example, the com-
plete waste of the chapel half
hour by so to 95 per cent of the
student body, and the silly con—
duct of about two per cent of
them who have made themselves
a source of shame to the rest of
us, and have given a very false
and unfair impression of Grinnell
college students to casual visi-
tors.

mug, is the chapel service," Dr.
conard declared, again rciterat»
ing his denial that the proginm
was for anything other than the
impi-ovement of chapel,

“I speak very positively on this.

president Nonen and asked for a

know what I asked for."

Pioneers Meet
(Continued Eom page ll

l
in hand In addition, Fred Bowl
the end who caught a pass‘
and ran 85 yards to score against
Drake last year, is likely to cause
the Pioneers a little trouble,

In the backfield, Paul Hartnek,
Zlospolmd former boxer will pron
ably play the leading role. Har
rick. converted from a guard,
scored two touchdowns and ave
aged Seven yards a try for his
bail carrying efforts as Creighton
beat South Dakota two weeks ago
by a 2570 score.

Shaker-p indicated.

As for Grinnell, a shakcup is
indicated. according to CoachGuyl
Lookabaugh, although he isn't
sure just yet what form it will
take. The Pioneers will be handi-
cappcd by the absence of a num-

ber of the regulars, including‘

Dayl Evans, tackle, who is def—
initely out with a knee injury,
It is doubtful. as yet whether
Scotty McLeod, quarterback, will
play. His knee is getting better,

according to Lookahaugh, but itY

is certain that he will not he able
to start.

Lynn Schlotterbeck is another
who may play but will certainly
not start, but Richy Boiler, who
revived an old hip injury last

against Creighton.
Baclrliehl Uncertain.

The sliakciip, if it does mater-
ialize, according to Lookabaugh,
will consist of onc or possibly
two changes in the backfield, one
at end, and possibly two others
in the line. it is entirely possible,
he said, that Bill Sampson will
start at one of the halfback pos

‘The end situation is another-
problem Not cntirely satisfied
with Klein's play against the Tue
tors, Lookabaugli may rise Hay-
ward, if he returns from Davens
port in time or he may use Joe
Woodward, if the big fellow is
sufficiently recovered from his
back iniury

“Other changes in the starting
line-rip will depend largely on
practice performances this week,”

, Lookabaugh said.

DRAMA COUNCIL TO MEET.

The Dramatic council will meet
Friday afternoon at 8:30 o'clock
