Q

Is Ford Really A Better Idea?

by J. C. Woods

It had been a cold day in Jan-
uary and in spite of local rumor the
temperature had dropped below tw»
enty degrees. Our warehouse was
air-conditioned. Luckily we had fl-
oat after float of Alkavseltzer and
Clairol to unload. At least we kept
warm. A bell rings. lt'sbreaktime,
John Porter and I wander Over to
his work table and we sit there Sh-
ivering. Finally he says;;

“I though your Mr. Nixon was a
shrewd politician.”

"He is, he wasn’t named Tricky '
Dick, for nothing," I responded.

”Well he just missed a political
finesse I wouldn’t have missed for
the World."

“What do you mean?”

“I mean Gerry Ford. lwould ne-
ver have made Gerry Ford my
Vice-President. Not only is hemore
attractive than Nixon, but he is hone
est. Make him President and Water—
gate will be over."

“But Gerry Ford is an idiot,” I
said.

“Isn’t that what America wants?
Don’t answer than. Anyway Nixon
could have picked somebody less
attractive.”

“Who? and remember,” I Said,
“Congress has to approve this per-

Kuhl: Congrats $8.3

To The Editors:

Enclosed is payment for the sub-
scription to the sen. Many thanks
for starting it last week.

As a lormer sun editorpwho has
prostituted his journalistic soul for
public relations, I think you are
turning out a very professionally-
looking newspaper.

Thorn “Bronko.” Kuhl, ('42)

Students. IBlast Arnold

To the Editors:

We have noted a grave error in
your coverage of recent l—M B-
Ball developments.

Mr. Rich Arnold has taken it upon
himself to editorialize on matters
of which he possesses little or no
knowledge. In a blunt, butundeniably
ignorant statement, “Arnie" or
"'Bu»Fu” Arnold, as he is affec-
tionately known in the locker room,

has declared that the simple anni-
hilation of the Clark Hall E-Ball
squad by the fantastically talented

Main-Mears team was due, in full,
to the absenceofClark's moderately

adequate shooting star. Arnold st»
ates, “Clark, however, lostitsteam
later in the week when (Johnyiiaie
gh was injured in the early min»
utes oi the game with MaineMeal-s.

Haigh's injury allowed MainrMears
to squeak by Clark, 33-31." This
analysis, however, ignores thei'acts
of the matter.

in a nova performance, the Main—
Mears team was in complete control
of the game, even after the loss of
two ol their starting players topre»
Vious commitments. Leading by a
whopping nine points with only a
few minutes remaining in the bla-
tantly one-sided contest, the Main-
Mears playing live, then composed
largely or substitutes, relaxed and
allowed the game to appear close
at its conclusion This bit of sport-
smanship, in trying not to run up
the score and in attempting to per»
mit all members of the team in
play regardless of ability, went
completely unnoticed by Mr. Ar-
hold. Perhaps, however, he was un-
able to attend the contest (if we
should be so kind as to refer to
it as such) due to conﬂicting eng-
agements or inability to compre-
hend the I»M schedule. '

We certainly hope that the size
or your sports stall is not so lim-
ited that you are forced to retain
Mr, Arnold in such a capacity.Per-
haps you would find that his “tale

ems” could be put to better use if
he were tried out as a paper de-
livery boy or something of a sim-
ilar nature which he might be able
to handle. ,

Meanwhile, weanxiously awaityour
next article on l—M B—Ball and we

son."

“How about Brooke?"

”Brooke?” I asked, incredulity
ﬂashing in my eyes. “Why not go
all the way and nominate Huey
Newton?"

”No man, that’s not the same
thing at all. Ed Brooke is a good
Republican. He has lots of senior-
lty in the Senate. He has a good
record. He’s not exactly contro-
versial, but at the time he’s well—
known.”

Reiner: Apply For SA

To the Editors:

This week, applications for next
year's student advisor positionsha—
ve become available. The student
advisor program is a long-standing
tradition at Grinnell, yet it is cer—
tainly one which has olten received
the denigration or many of the stu-
dents. Most student criticisms cen-
Ier about the alleged lack of effi-
cacy of the program as a whole or
or the particular group of individ
uals chosen. While this is not the
appropriate place to respondtosuch
allegations, Suffice it to say that
many individuals, (deans, R.A.'s,
S.A.‘s, and students), feel a strong

Rostll'er:
Errors Corrected '

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter to correct
some misinterpretations resulting
lroin my comments and the subse~
quent article on the Loose Hall
Ball. Firstofall,asthearticledoes
state, we are underway with our
plans lor the party, however we had
not received or requested an offi»
cial and final approval from the ad—
ministration. Original plans to use
Quad were discussed before the ex-
tensive repairs, and this renovation
has caused a change in plans. The
article’s title falsely implied offi-
cial sanctioning by the administra-
tlon; hopefully plans will not be
jeopordized because or this error,
The article strongly implied thatl
am the chairman of this party, ‘and
has caused numerous people to con—
tact me for additional information.
Although I helped organized the prev
liminary work lor this party, and
will continue to help in its planning.
Noble Young is currently cosordi»
hating the party, and should be con»
tacted for further information, I
informed both the interviewer and
the editor of this, but this was ne-

ver printed. It is unfortunate that-

so many letters or correction need
to be written; better proofreading
and management could result in
better use of the limited newspaper
space we have.

Renita Ranere will sing works by
Mozart, Hanel, Britten, Dvorak, and
Teleman in her senior recital at
B p.m. tonight in Herrick Chapel.
The recital, postponed from Feb-
ruary 10, will include five other
Grinnell students.

reason other than racism?”

Program

and continuing need tor such a pros
gram. A concurrent need also ex-
ists for qualified and energetic ins
dividuals to fill SA. positions.

Vis—a-vis material compensation,
there is little, aside from a single
room. Further, 1 strongly suspect
that a single room is little reward
for the services provided by many
S.A.’s. Numerous S.A.'s, in fact,
regard the single room as a bene-
fit which is incidental to the exper-
ience and personal satisfaction de-
rived from the position. The value
of these latter factors is not dir-
ectly assessable in terms ofpopu-
larity, grades, or GPA, but in ot~
her, personal terms may he imm-
easurable.

This letter is not intended as ade-
ferlse or an exhaustive discussicnoi
the student advisor position. Cer-
tainly there is much room for im-
provement in the program. impro—
vements will not originate and be
maintained by the counseling comm-
ittee or any such organization on
campus, however, but must come
from the students themselves. Ac-
cordingly, it youreelyou maybeable
to make a positive contribution to
the sat. program, 1 strongly urge
you to apply. This is a signilicant
opportunity to improve the S.A.
program in the year to come.

Maynard Ferguson’s Greates

by Bruce Green

Maynard Ferguson has put out live
volumes of his record series M F
Horn, and the latest set, "M F
Horn Four And Five, Live at Jimr
my's,” Col. KG 32732, is by lar
the best of the lot, In the first
place, it is a live album, which
is always a good way of capture
ing the lire or a group like his
anyway. In the second place, Fer-
guson himself is a member of that
handful of jazz trumpeters thatcane
not be outclassed by any save
Dizzy, Miles and Freddie Hubbard.
in the third place, the group iea~
tures soloists other than Ferguson
such as Bruce Johnstuhe in ”Stay
Loose With Bruce," a fine blues
track, and detinitely one of the
finest on the album. And in the
fourth place, Ferguspn’s band is one
of the few in the business that
doesn’t wrap itself in a cloud (or
fog) ol nostalgia, or destroy the
great potential of a powerfully sw-
inging big band by being too far
out the other way,

The album opens With an excell»
ent new number, “Tonova,” which
was dedicated to the producer of
the album, Teo Macero, and fear
tured good 50105 from the leader
and Ferdinand Povel on tenor sax.
They then went into the most sat-
isfylng cut on the album, “Macs
Arthur Park.”

“MacArthur Park" opens up with
the melody and some good solo

Politics, Academics Excite

by Robin necani

When I called kay Jordan for an
interview on Tuesday, she immede
lately requested that I wait until
Friday morning to Set a time. Fri-
day came around, and Jordan asked
that I try again in the afternoon.
At 2 P.M., the time we decided
upon, I telephoned to ask when she
would like to do this horrible in—
terview, and she replied “Shoot."
“On the phone?” I said, with a gasp
of shock. “Um, well, you see, we
have a photographer coming to take
your picture, and why don’t I come
over with him?” I added at about
200 miles an hour. I assured her
that it wouldn’t take a lot of time,
as she had to get to the library
before 3.

In fact, don’t
ever expect toi'ind
Kay Jordan sitting
at home contem-
plating her navel,
for the young Jor-
dan has a diver-
sity of talents, in
terests and . ac
complishments to keep most people
busy for a lifetime.

In politics, Kay Jordan seems to
fall naturally into the leadership
position. She is the head of the re-
cently formed Grinnell Chapter of
the Iowa Women’s Political Cau»
cus. When asked about how she
achieved this honor, she replied
with a shrug, “Nobody else wanted
to do it,"

The immediate aim or the group,
now only a baby organization, 5hr
ould be to seek a diverse meme
bership, Jordan stressed. At the
first meeting, about 25 Grinnell
women officially joined the caucus,
including a majority of teachers
and professors' wives, The group,
remarked Jordan, cannot be effecr
tive unless it represents people
from the community of all ages
and backgrounds—-lrom high-sc-
hool students, to middle agedhome»
makers, to the elderly in the May»
flower home.

To attain this balance, she ex—
plained, the organization must deal
with issues that hit home to Grins
nell women and not alienate those
who attribute the women's purpose
to be merely a rejection of men or
other such aims“

since she can remember, kaylore
dan has always enjoyed politics.
in undergraduate school, she faith-
fully attended political meetings,
leafletted, and was devoted to the
plight of unsuccessful candidates
and causes, Soon after graduation,
Kay could have been found working
in Washington as a senator's ass-
istant. Another current title held
by Jordan is First Ward County
Committeewoman for the Iowa De-
mocratic Party.

when I enthusiastically inquired
about the details of this position,
Kay replied modestly, "on, I'm
only the local party hack. It’s just
a nifty—gritty, dirty job.” lier due
ties include raising runds, writing

 

work by various members at the
band. Followed by an outstandin.
tenor solo by Ferdinand Povel, it
breaks out at one point in an im-
provisation accompanied only by
percussion, in which he solos for
several choruses on an old Calypso
phrase. Then comes some spectac-
ular band sectional work, and a
phenomenal solo by Maynard him-
self.

Maynard and his band haven’t ever
been better on records than on this
one, which also includes such num-
bers as “Nice and Juicy,” ”Blue
Birdland," “The Fox Hunt," and
"I’m Getting Sentimental Over
You.” Outside of Duke Ellington,
Count Basie and Thad Jones»Mel
Lewis, there is not one band in
contemporary big band jazz with
the drive of Ferguson’s, and this
album is just one more example
in the bag {or his supremacy.
Campus Music News»sRenita Ra-
nere, a mezzossopraho will hold
her recital, postponed from earlier
in the semester, this Friday ,at
l pm. in Herrick. Saturday night
at 8 pin, also in Herrick, Pro-
lessor James Wyly will hold an
organ recital, and Jaye Hamilton
will hold her senior lecture rc—
cital in Herrick at 8 pm. Sunday
night. So it looks like a busy week—
end for the Music Department, and
also for Herrick.

letters and making calls for local
candidates, as well as getting out
the vote on election day.

Jordan is interested in talking
to college students who wish to
work in the'town for local elections.
“Although students,” she contended,
"may not agree with the ideologies
or many Grinnell townspeople,” she
believes that “it is beneficial for
them to get out into the town and
educate themselves in the Grinnell
that extends beyond the boundaries
or the college."

And if her politicalactivities sound
impressive, along with a multitude
of other degrees. includinga B.A.,
a M.A, in history and a Certificate
or Restoration, Kay Jordan is pre-
sently completing her Masters in
emotionally and behaviorally dis»
turbed children. Her current field
work takes her out of her Grinnell
home to the outpatient clinic at
a psychiatric hospital in Iowa
City three afternoons a week.

As we paused between bites of
MKLM’S with her two-year-uld dau»
ghter Anna (Jordan is also a home-
maker), she added that the suppor—
tlve atmosphere in Grinnell created
by her husband, history professor
oavid Jordan, other iaculty wives,
and cheap, friendly babysitters is
quite agreeable to the pursuit of
her political and academic endea—
vors. Previous to her“easy—going”
Grinnell existence, Jordan taught in
the inner city schools or Washington,
D.C.
