THUMBS UP 011' THUMBS DOWNi
0n next Friday and Saturday there!
will he in Grinnell, as guests of the'
student body, over a hundred High
School students who are in attendance
at.the press convention. Everything,
possible is being done by those in'
'charge of the affair to moire the delerl
. gates feel at home While here; butl
a committee of half a duzem men and'
women cannot do it all. The owners-
tion of the entire student body is nec-
essary.
You all remember, students of Grin»
nell, the time when we came here asI
,freshrnen. You remember that feeling
which we all had and which is so
._common to the stranger and traveler
- everywhere and which is so ably ex-
pressed in these anonymous lines:

I
l

i
t
r

"Whenever I travel

I ask at least three train-men

If this is the right. train

For where I am going.

Even then

I hardly believe them."

You remember also how this feeling

was dispelled and we decided that this
was not sucha bad place after all
when every person we met had a

smile and a pleasant greeting for 'us.

Our suspicions vanished at once and
we lrnew that we were welcme to
Gi-inneii and that we were going to
like it. A smile and a greeting can

work wonders.

These High School people who are
our guests are going to be pretty much
in the same frame of mind that we
' were as new corners to Grinhell. If we
‘do not vanish this feeling from their

minds and make them feel that we are

glad to have them here ‘it will mean

“thumbs down“ for Grinuell as far as
-tlley are concerned. But if they are
given a greeting and treated as ane’s
guests should be treated it will he,
“thumbs up" Grinnell will have the
favor or the crowd

It's awfully artsy toisay “Hello", lu-
ti’oduce yourself. as}: email who he is
and talk to him tor a few minutes.
Try it on Friday and Saturday and
make some friends for Grinnell.

THE NEW STYLE FOR GLEE CLUBS

We note in the last issue of the

Century an article on “Remodeling
the Glee Club.“ The article describ-
es the change in the type of music
sung in the Harvard Glee Club; the
old style college songs of the "Folly-
WollyrDoodlc" type have been thrown
in the discord in the last four years in
favor of Debussy, Mendelssohn.
Brahms, Hayden and others of this,

hand means something more than more

want at the pep lncctiiLs, why not

hum
loge hand. '

The whole trouble lies in the fact
that the men will not collie out to
practice. Does a football player “my
dawn on the job" simply because lie
does not llliK‘ some play that the child]
has worked out?’ No. ile determines
to mftlle the play it success WliPLller
he likes it or not. Membership in (lily

A l1\Cl\' DI interest (llld it lilcll of sense
of responsibility seems to be the out-
stztilding characteristic of not only the
members of tho ltduil, hut DI the illemr
hers 0i malty other campus organ
tions.

In conclusion, let me say that each
and cvcrv strident in Grinnell college
ln‘rs an important part to play. All
can't play on a toolhnll team; ill ctul’t
win an honor- G,; but all of ris can put
our greatest efforts support and my-
nlty into the few things that we do
undertake. I wish to thank, in behalf
of the band, the student council for-
the amount of money extended to the
organization from the semester fees.
However, I do not wish to put a iner-
ccnar-y ralrrc on our college loyalty, so
.I would suggest that students show
their true loyalty by getting the men
who play out to practice “The student
body is pleading for a united Uighur
ization," Where is this “pleading”?

“Know Your Faculty”
Column

The Editor of the Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sir.

In the last issue or the s. &. 3., I
noticed an editorial written on "the,
build". I do not wish to say that the
writer of this article is entirely wrong'
I do wish to say that the writer is an
onloolrer and an observer instead of
an acti e worlrer in the hand. If he
was actively connected with the hand
there would he no such motive for
writing such an article. With yam"
permission, dear editor, I wish to cor» ‘
rect some of the ideas set forth in
your article. Being personally- connect ‘
ed with the hand for the past three’
years. I feel as though I am more
competent to spealr regarding the band
and its relation to Grihnell Coll‘ege. j

I heartily agree with you tha “a
band is an impormnt factor in drum~
ming up a crowd for a pep meeting".
You also state that the student body
and team are thankful for the sup-
port that the loyal ones have given.
Let me ask you it you lrnow who the
loyal ones have been in the bandl
strange. as it may seem. the loyal
ones in the hand during the past three
years have not been students entirely.
out in few town men' and about a half
dozen students, These town men have
formed the real backbone of the or
ganrzation.

The football team will afford a good
example of what I want to impress
upon your mind. What kind. of a footc
ball team would Grinnell have if the
players went out to practice only
when they feel like it? The quarter—
baclr says, “I can’t come out to prac-
tice this afternoon because I have
some lessons to get. I may be out to
practice tomorrow afternoon if I feel
like it and I haven’t anything else to
do”. In other words he will do every
other thing ﬁrst before he attempts
to do the thing that he really ought to
do.
student organizations in Grinnell
depend for their success upon the icy—
alty and support of each and every
strident. Each campus organization
will he exactly what the members
make of it. Who can make the or
nell college better than it is if
it is not the students themselves?
Men who are really interested in mils-
ic have a wonderful chance to gain
some real musical lrnowledge under
the present leadcrship, We are not ob
tempting to perfect a second Sousd’s
band. However, I do believe that a
