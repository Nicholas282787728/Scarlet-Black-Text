from Carleton and Cornell put
the damper to the final games of
the season. The Grinnellians,

for the season, had to be content
with the consolation of playing
a whale of a contest in both
encounters. Cornell won, 70769.

Hoop Yearlings
Shock Cornell

In 67-48 Win

Grinneii’s freshman basketball
team ended its l950-5l cams
paign by blasting Cornell 67-48
in Derby Tuesday night.

This victory gave Coach
Wayne Cooley’s charges a 272
season record. Revenging a 57-
51 defeat at the hands of the
Rams earlier in the season, the
Pioneers had things pretty
much their own way from the
outset, quickly jumping to a
10—0 lead. The frosh, playing
their best game of the year,
held 3' 19—point advantage at
halftime and were never head—
ed thereafter.

Big Bob Winter scored time
and time again when points
were needed, ending up the
night with 26 counters. Tom

nal set shots compiled 19 mark.
ers for the runnersup spot. John
Young’s steady rebounding,
Mikc Litka's 11 points and ally
round game, and scrappy Don
Hager’s floor play also high-
lighted the battle. '

Many of the yearlings show-
ed grcat promise of the future,
with Winter especially impres-
sive in the season final.

Last Friday night, Dal-by gym:

  

tual story.

The Pioneers settled down af-
ter the first few minutes of the
lsecond stanza to give every in-
dication of pulling out the stop-
pers on a winning effort. But
after seeing Grinnell ahead by
40735, the Carls promptly applied
the skids to the local lads and
poured on the coal and poured
in the baskets.

The Pioneers had their bomb—
'sigllts adjusted to the point of
tallying 14 out of 19 freethrows
for a 73.7% mark, the second
highest of the season. But the
basket managed to evade all but
21 of the 79 attempts of the two
,point variety. Dave Dunlop cash-
ed in for 27 points to take the top
snoring honors with ease.

Then came Tuesday. and there
came with Tuesday a visit from
the boys at Cornell. Cornell had
swung the axe over Carleton
the night after the Carleton-
Grinnell tilt, and beat the Min-
nesota cagers down 91—73. Now,
the second place Rams came to
Grinnell seeking new blood, but
ended losing a little of their
own before they eked out their
70—69 victory.

The boys from Mount Vernon
brought along a sophomore
scoring sensation in the form of
Lloyd Olmstead, second high
scorer in the conference behind
Dunlop. Mr. Olmstead readily
made himself at home in Darby
and pushed through 12 field
goals and a trio of charity tries
for 27 points.

The complexion of the contest
changed like the colors of a
chameleon, with Grinnell show-
ing real promise by leading 39.
30 at the half way point. Then,
the Rams grabbed the driver‘s
seat and drove in 24 points in
the third quarter, putting them
out in from 54752 at that time.
From then on. it was strictly
do‘g eat dog.

With a minute to go, the Cor»
nell team had a three point
lead, which Dave Dunlop prompte
