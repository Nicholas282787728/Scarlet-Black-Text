is $135,000 more than last

trast to a $49,000 deiicit last
year and over $100,000 before
that.

Bowen felt that in major
fields there should be more than
two instructors. One more pros
iessor will no employed next
year and from then on, he hopes,
two a year until the necessity is
alleviated,

Operating budget tor the
library next year will be upped
$7, 00, This money will be used
tor purchasing new books, bind-
ing, service improvement, eli—
minating tees ,and a circulating
records library. Since this last
item is new to Grinncll, Bowen
hoped anyone having records
to donate will give them to the
library as a start tor the col-
lection.

Scholarships

The trustees will ‘provide
enough money so that those now
on scholarship may continue.
They hope also to provide as
many scholarships next year as
they provided this year. A fund
ot $15,000 was set up to help
students adjust to the tuition
raise. .

“Blair hall has got to gp.” A
round of applause greeted this
announcement. However, no def-
inite time was stated because
ot the high cost ot tearing down.

The Board ot Trustees have
given Bowen authority to make
