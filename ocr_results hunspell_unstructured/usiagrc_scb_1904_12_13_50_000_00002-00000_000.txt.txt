Li n ,,iit oi this week is the date oi
the iirst intersocrety dehate or the
’year and the one which should engage
an unusual share or the attention.
The debaters are to be chosen who
shall represent Iowa College in the an»

nual intercollegiate contest with

Cornell which will take place in Grin-
nell sometime next March. It has
been noted at nineient times that
interest in society work this year in
all the societies is somewhat; below
the standard oflasb year and that de-
bating; along with the rest of the liter-
ary endeavors has sullercd from the
general prevailing apathy. It is ac-
cordingly erideht that this depart-
ment of college activity must needs be
given a vigorous impetus on this occa-

sion if the team is to litunclli ‘eliiuto

the It goes without saying that the
way for each to contribute his share is
ior all to attend and be generous with
appreciation.

It was feared ab one time that the
ideal of; qllztrtette would have L6 be
abandoned for this year but through
the kindness of Mr. Mitchell, who has
consented to be with the club on the
trip,‘ this diiiloulty has been over

The tenor work of Mr. Condit will
be much missed, though what appears
to be an excellent substitute has been
round in the baritone solos of Mr.
Ralph Lyman. The program willoe
materially strengthened by Mr.
Smith’s violin numbers.
