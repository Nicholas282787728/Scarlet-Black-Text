FEVER: Campus to Get Down SGA: President

and Dirty at Lambada Ball

section thatwould haveshnmed the
original Entropy House. Oh yeah,
and they sing in a language that
many of us hear only during cover-
age of the World Cup.

Different nationalities abound in
the band, but theyare first and lore-
most a Latin orchestra. And they
do a bang-upjob of it, too. In fact,
I’d goasfartosay thatthey arcthe
best darned lambada band in the
whole Central Tittle Zone. Which
raises the question, just what is a
lambada band doing in the Mid-
west, anyhow?

INTERNATIONAL:
New Students
Cope with
Transition

continued from page 4

Gondal also extended an invita-
tion to American students in be
involved in ISO as “the US is also
part of the international commu-
nity." To facilitate inter-action, new
international students are paired
with American roommates. ISO
hopes to increase this interaction
by increasing the opportunities on
campus to learn more about other
nations, such as showing intema—
tional movies on campus.

So what does good lnmbada
music sound like‘.7 Wcll, the sound
Mr. Real and the crew lay down

something like that.

People in Burling werejust full
of opinions on how to pick a good
lambada partner. Eddie Nginilla,
who saw tambadaras a reaction to
the safesex ‘80’s, is scopin‘ for
someone/“who knows the Health
Center posters like the back of their
butt." Mo Cox thinks “somebody
who wouldn‘t hurt me” would be
prime. The Cowles Staff, taking
their coffee break, thought some»
body“agile,andsomconcwithalot
of donuts” was the hot tip.

A couple of the Harris Center
construction workers, possibly the
real Getham Bros. just didn‘t want
to cooperate. “Hey. you can‘tbe in
here!" “Uh, yeah, I'm leaving. I
just wanted to know with whom
you guys would lambada if you
could?" "Oh yeah? lambada this.
buddy and get back outside that
fence!“ ‘

Shows why nobody picked the
Gelhat'n Bros. or even the Loomis
Bros. as their dream lambada part-
ners. Actually, nobody ran away

past and present SGA people. it
does an excellent job of showing
how to get involved with SGA and
showingwhatSGAdoes. Hopefully
itwilleliminatealotofthemystery
that SGA seems to inspire.

Many people have suggested that
we somehow provide a guideline
forsenatorstowritebetterminutes.
I personally feel reluctant to stifle
the creativity of some senators in
order to improve the minutes of
thosewhoarealittleremiss in their
duties. However, starting next
weekacomputerizedSGAOfﬁcial
Agenda and Minutes will be

available through the AVAX, in
addition to current SGA news. It
will be an excellent supplement for
pwple who have great senatorial
minutes and an excellent substitute
for those with Iess-lhan-adcquatc
senatorial minutes.

We in SGA want to do a good
job. Right now we are actively
seeking suggestions on how to
improve. If you have any ideas,
however “small." or criticisms (as
long as you provide a solution)
pleasclog on to theAVAXnnd Tell
[SGA]. Any liitlc blurb would be
appreciated. If that’s too taxing,
seek out your senator and have her/
him relay the message to me.

TRIBES: South Africa Divided

continued from page 7

Inkatha, South Africa's largest
political party with 1.5 million
members. Buthelezi and Inkatha
are opposed to violent revolution,
economic sanctions and socialism.
They instead suppon the peaceful
dismantlement ufapanheid through
reform and economic empowers
ment of South African blacks
through foreign investment. Zulu
political ideology expressed by the
elected representatives of the Zulu
people differs radically from the
tenets espoused bchlson Mandela
and Oliver Tambo.
Inl983,thefirstfreenationwide
elections for the mayors and town
Councilors ofblack townships took
place in the RSA. That same year
the U'DF was formed as a legal
internal wing of the ANC.
Representing the ANC, the UDF
participated in these elections.
Black South African voters
overwhelmingly rejected the

candidates of the UDF in favor of
moderate blacks who advocated
reform rather than revolution.
Opponents of economic sanctions
and ANC violence such as Nelson
Bottle of Soweto, Tamsanqa Linda
of Ibahyi. and Esau Mahlatsi of
Sharpesvilleweteallelocledmayots
of their respective townships over
UDF candidates. In free and fair
local elections, the UDF, a branch
of the ANC was unable to defeat
moderate black candidates who
advocated reform and rejected
sanctions, violence and Marxism.
The ANC is not the sole
representative of black South
Africans; it is not even the most
important representative. Black
South Africans are not a uniﬁed
cultural or political unit. The
township elections since 1983
indicate that the ANC would be
defeated in any fully free national
election in South Africa. Despite
the popularity of Mandela and the
ANC in the West, the views of men

like Mayor Nelson Bottle and
Butltelczi are far more
representative or the majority or
black South Africans.
