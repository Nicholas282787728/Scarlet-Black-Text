president of the student governing
organization, the White House
was closed when Shelton L. Beat-
ty. ventunng into the recreation
center for a cup of Coffee, looked
under a sofa to be greeted by a
litter of licoke" bottles, a pile of
dirt, and a multitude of cigarette
butts. On consultation with Young,
it was decided that .the front
rooms and the upstairs of the
White House would be closed un-

Favor Changes
In White House
Survey‘S/lows

By Jo Smith.

Latest eyerbl'owsralslllg rumors
seem to have switched from the
administration and examinations
to the closing of the “hot spot" of
the campus known as the White
House.

Students bellow, snort, gripe,
and howl about the catastrophe,
but still this day and night club
of Crinnell remains coldly shut to
all Visitors, The reason is that
the White House is getting a
cleaning it has never had before
and, is about to undergo a new
regime.

A. recent survey showed opinions
of a few of the more socidlrmindr
ed students as to what should be
done with it, The question put
up to them was:

”If you were given permission
to improve the White House in
any way, what would you do?"

Russ GainiTear down the drap-
eries, refinish the woodwork, take
out the rugs and put in a compo-
sition floor, organize more recre-
ation besides necking, and so on
into inﬁnity.

Watercolor Exhibition by Wm. Zorach
Opens in Main Hall at Quadrangle

 

An exhibition of watercolors by
William Zorach, the well-known
American artist, opened in the
Main hall of the Quadrangle Sat-
urday.

Most of the pictures on display
were paintcd within a few miles
of the artist's summer retneat in
Maine and show the brilliant col-
ors and the cool blues and greens
which predominate in the sur-
rounding landscape.

Aidicitgh Zorach is noted for his
watercolors, it is in monumental
sculpture that he shows his best
work. In that mctliiim he is rep-
resented in many important mu-
seums and in the Radio City
Music hall in New York.

showing at an carly age an
unusual talent in drawing, he

went on to develop his skill by
attcnding the Cleveland art
school. Later he spent two years
in Paris where he worked in a
number of schools and studios
and spent his timc in museums.
When he returned to New York,
his paintings soon attracted the
attention of collectors, critics, and
the gcncral public. In 1917, while
he was camping in New Hamp-
shire, he did some relief carving
in wood, and the next slimmer a
small tcrra cottzl figure By 1922
he abandoned painting in oil
completely to devote his time to
sculpture, but continues to work
in watercolor as a relaxation.
The exhibition will continue

through February 22

Mysterious Cards Baffle Students;
{Rosy’s’ ReferencesSeem Senseless

A local takeoff on the infamous
Mafia. organization got under way
yesterday, when four Crinnell
students received postcards, inked
with skull and crossboncs, and
signed cryptically, “Rosy."

The cards contained only a
library reference in addition to
the signature, and thc recipients
were requested to look up this
reicrcncc, Robert Young, Dibble;
Kent Hampton, Macy; Marinn
Marsh, Haines,‘ and Jane Goplc~
riid, Haincs, all receivcd identical
cards with diifcreut references.

thii Young had traced the
rctcrciice down, he was con-
fronted with the statement, “Is
your name Sliylock?" Hampton's
rcicrciice rcad, “She may have
gone to tho postoffice,"

Goplcriid’s rclcrcnce was rctli-

el' long in comparison to the
others. It read, “You're doing all
right, but we expect better
things." And Marsh's passage,
when she had tracked it to a con-
clusion, was in German, Al Pom-
mer was called in, according to
Young, but the message remains
a secret as yet.

The Scarlet and Black, with an
eye to servmg its readers, ini-
mediatcly got on the trail in an
attempt to solve the puzzle,

Not all who are siispoctedhave
been questioned as yet, but John
)[COUne, editor of thc Zephyr,
was subjected to a period of quiz-
zing in thc s. it B. ofticc last
night. After two hours of quesA
tioniiig, he still dcnied his guilt,
and lctt saying, “I've been
iinmed I'm innocent."
