a three run home run with two outs
in the bottom of the seventh inning
Monday, sending the game intoextra
innings, then scored the winning run
in the tenth for Grinnell’s first win
of the 1974 baseball season. The
Pioneers won the non-conference
tilt, the first game of a doublehead-
er, 10-9 over Graceland. The Gra-
celanders did gain a split, however,
by roaring back in the nightcap to
a 15-2 dGCiSion.

Tuesday, in more non-conference
home action, a hefty squad from St.
Ambrose College romped to a 22—9
triumph .over the Grinnell 9. The ’
defeat dropped Grinnell’s overall
record to 1-9, 0-4 in conference

play.

' Losing 9-2, it looked bleak for the
Pioneers entering the seventh inns
ing of the first Graceland contest.
Starting pitcher Zippe had fallen
behind in the early going, giving
up two two run homers to Grace-
land’s Torry Noble, who coinciden-
tally, was Graceland’s starting pit-
cher. Despite Grinnell tallies in the
first and fifth frames, the Pioneers
found themselves down 9-2 going
into the seventh.

After setting down Graceland
quickly in the top of the inning,
the Pioneers came up for their last
bats. Mark Hanisch led off with a
base hit up the middle, but John
Haigh, who had driven in Grinnell's
first run, lined out hard to third
base. Paul Delaney followed with
a. base on balls, after which senior
Bill Johnson smashed a line,single
over second base to load the bases.
.Dave Wynberg calmly looked at
a H pitch lor ball four, driving in
a run and the score was 5-3.

At this point Coach John Plitsch
went to his bench, putting up sen-
ior outfielder Bill Warren to hit
for Matt Brennan. Warren deliver-
ed a sacriﬁce fly to deep left field,
adding a run, and the second out.

Grinnell College tracksters came
in fourth place in the William Penn
Invitational at Oskaloosa Wednes-
day, April 17. Penn won the meet
with 93 points. Penn was followed
by Central 64, Simpson 47, Grinn-
ell 35, and Cornell 21.

Grinnell’s field men acquired th-
ree places. Lincoln Marshall got a
fourth in the triple jump, DennisWa-
lters got a fifth in the discus, and
javelin tosser Chip Hall lost a nar-
row contest to Tower of Penn. Hal-
l's toss of 186 feet earned him a
seond place. Dan Heft was the only
hurdler or sprinter to place with
his fifth in the intermediate hurd-
les. ‘

Tommorrow

by Dave Calvert

Women’s tennis wraps up its 1974
intercollegiate seasontomorrowwi-
th a road moat at William Penn
College in Oskaloosa, la. The wo-
men take with them an 0- Z (2
lies) record, having been rained
out at Simpson last week.

Although line-ups for tomorrow’s,
tilt are not as yet certain, the most
regular players onthe rosterinclude
Michelle Rothehberg, Catherine
Lee, Robin Recant, Ellen Yackhin,
Ellen Grady, and Karen Kahn. Ea-
ch of these team members was in-
volved in the two ties two weeks ago
at Drake.

Coach Anna Wack, eager to give
the squad more opportunity to play

‘ after the season ends tomorrow. has
set up 3 singles ladder for team
members only.‘The ladder will be
used to determine final team rank.

Tennis for women will continue next
year, probably in the fall as well as
in the Spring.

Women’s varsity sports in general
for the fall term will probably
include field hockey, tennis, swim—
ming, and volleyball.

Walks to right fielder Phil Frank

ahd‘catcheciwade Lee, and a couple
of wild pitches brought the score
to 9—6, setting the stage for Zippe‘s
heroics. Zippe batting with two on
and two out, represented the tieihg
run at the plate. Spurred on, no
doubt, by the frantic cheers of the
9 or 10 hardy souls that had turn-
ed out to watch the affair, Zippe
swung at the third pitch and drove ‘
the ball somewhere in the vicinity
of the football practice field. The
fans went crazy and the team sw-
armed out onto the field to meet the
Zipper at home plate. The game
went into extra innings when l-lah-
isch fanned to end the seven run
barage.

For the record. it was Grinnell’s
first 1974 extra inning game, most
runs scored in an inning this year,
and first home run of the season.
It was also Zippe’s first career
round-tripper, and all in Grinnell’s
first win of the year.

Interestingly enough, it was not the
first time that Grinnell had beaten
Graceland in intercollegiate com-
petition this year. The Pioneerbas-
ketbaLl squad, way back in early
December, got its first victory of
the season over Graceland at the
William Penn Tip-off Tournament.
it was also not the first time that
Craig Zippe had come through in a
last second clutch situation. Althv
ough playing only in a reserve
role through much of the basket—
ball season, Zippe found himself
on the court in the late stages of
a very tight contest in DarEy Gym~
nasium with Cornell on Feb. 16,
Somehow, with 2 seconds showing
on the game clock andGrinnell down
by a point, Zippe managed to can a
20 foot jump shot for Grinnell’s
only conference win of the year.

classic come from behind style.
Due to a mix-up in the starting
time, the milers did not get a pro-
per warmup. They were told they
had an extra fifteen minutes to wa—
rm up in but they actually only
got five minutes.

Dave Raub took third in 4:35.
Clifford Clusin took three guys in
the last lap to take fourth in 4:47.
In the three mile Raub. Torn How-
land, and Neal Klegermah, were
the last three runners at the end
of the first lap in the fifteen man
field. They gradually moved up so
that they finished 2nd, 3rd, and 6th
respectively. Raub made up an am-
azing amount of yardage on the
winner, George Delperdang of Cor-
nell, but didn’t quite have enough
to take him.

The half mile was Grinnell’s best
event. Jim Briles and MarkBlanch—
ard stayed in the middle of the pack
until the gun lap. They then moved
up, passed the leader together and
sprinted away from the tield.Briles
won in 2:03.? with Blanchard sec~ ]
0nd, just one second behind. ,

In the mile relay David Jenney put
Grinnell into second and Lincoln
Marshall held the position. Blan-
chard falt/ered and was passed by a
Penn runner, but Briles anchored
strongly, narrowly missing a second
place finish.

Grinnell is having severe problems
with injuries. Many points have been
lost due to the recent injuries to

to take over for a tiring Zippe, who
moved to shortstop.

After Delaney made short work of
Graceland in the top of the tenth,
Grinnell won the contest in their
half. Again it was Zippe, this time
leading off with a Walk. Afteral-lan-
isch sacrifice, and error on the
shortstop, a stolen base, and an in-
tentional walk, the bases were load,
ed for Bill Johnson. Johnson never
had to swing the bat, as a wild pits

The second game featured Han-
isch’s Grinnell pitching debut, and
the game remained close until the
seventh, when he tired and was she—
lled for eight runs. Dave Wynberg
led all Pioneer batters with asingle
and a double. other hits were col-
lected by Zippe and Haigh. Wyn~
berg and Zippe got Grinnell’s two
REI’s.

Tuesday‘s loss to St. Ambrose got
so out of hand it was called after
six innings, with Ambrose up 22-9.
it was, however, Grinnell’s stron -
est offensive show of the year,
ded greatly by very poor fielding
on the part of Ambrose. l-lanisch,
Delaney, and Wes Fujii collected
two hits apiece, and others were
added by Zippe and Wade Dee, as
the Pioneers scored 9 runs on 8
hits. Hanisch had two RBI’S and two
runs scored.

Delaney pitched only 1 2/2 inh—
ings, taking the loss. Fujii went
the rest of the way.

Neimen Win 2 of 3

by John Lom

The crippled Grinnell Tennis team

got back into the win-column this
past week. After the disasters of
two weeks ago, rebounded to win
two of this week’s three matches.
Despite the indefinite “moth-ball-
ing” of number three singlesplayer
Bob Rossen (because of a severe
shoulder strain), Grinnell was still
able to squeak past Knox, smash
Wartburg, and lose to a good Uni-
yersity of Northern lowa team.

Grinnell returned to its winning
ways by defeating Knox College 5.4

reviated match, Top rated Brad

of their conference opponents, but
they had not counted on such strong
performances from the Minnesota
schools. Grinnell's appalling shot-

in.

Hopefully, with several days of
strong practice, weather allowing,
the Pioneers can cure their ailm»
ents.

The only bright spot in this rather
grave day was playing the Confer-
ence golf course and being able to
visit all the roughs, sand traps,
and water hazards that they hope
to evade for the upcoming Confer~
ence championship.

and Paul Van Schilfgaarde were vi-
ctorious in their singles matches.
vazales won 10-4. while Edwards
and Van Schiltgaarde garnered res-
pective 10-5 and 10-0 triumps. In
doubles action, the number one duo
of Vazales and Neil Trabich and the
number three tandem of AndyBloom
and Ricky Keller secured the Grin-
nell victory by winning by the iden-
tical score of 10-5.

Grinnell continued its winning ways
this Wednesday by thrashing Wart-
burg College 6-0 in an exclusive
singles confrontation. All six Pion-
eers looked to be in top form with
Van Schilfgaarde giving the most
impressive performance witha 10-0
shutout and Bloomprovidedthe most
suspenseful show (as usual) by con-
vincing his opponent to "wimp out”
in a 11-10 tie—breaker. Also re-
markable was the posting of his fo-
urth consecutive singles victory by
Edwards who remained undefeated
for the year.

However, later that same day the
tired Pioneers succumbed toafresh
U.N.l. team by a score of 7-2,
but still managed to play quality
tennis. ,Vamles again came through
with an impressive 7-6, 6-4 victory
and teamed up with Trabich to post
a 643, 6-4 flailing to account for
the Pioneer pluses.

ln rebounding back to what it lik-
es to dq—-win, the Grinnell tennis
team showed that it has not fallen
down and died. The fact that all
players are starting to show signs ,
of consistency may lead to a future
of more victories.
