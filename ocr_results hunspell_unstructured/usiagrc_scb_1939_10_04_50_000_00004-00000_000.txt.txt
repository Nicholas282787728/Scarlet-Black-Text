ﬂit ALL ODDS

Starting from nothing and working with
energy and persistence to the top is afalnil-
iar fiction. In one type of ollr childhood
books some poverty-stricken boy invariably
struggled to fame.

As we’ve grown older, however, we’ve
“discovered” that the old idea of “Decide
what you want and get it despite all odds"
is impossible. We fear that in this world
of turmoil there are too many uncontroll-
able factors which will prevent us from at-
taining any set goal.

We haven’t the nerve to fight against
odds! And we haven’t the sense to set for
ourselves a positive goal toward which we
will work. Furthermore, fa too often we
do set a merely tentative or trial goal, from
which we are turned by the first opposL
tion.

The reasoning is specious which causes us
to feel that resolute effort toward a pre-
determined goal is futile! That this rea»
soiling is faulty has been demonstrated by
last year’s Cycltmc staff. Opposed from the
start on monetary grounds, held back by
deficient enthusiasm, and lacking precedent,
the Cyclone staff nevertheless produced an
annual which won a national first—class
honor rating!

It was done by solving their particular
difficulties, not by calling those difficulties
impossible barriers. The monetary problem
was worked out, enthusiasm was created,
and precedent was replaced with original:
ity.

But while we commend those responsible
for the Cyclone, we may well remember that
a goal was decided upon and was realized
despite all odds.

CAMPUS lMPltTVEMTNlS

Grinnell college is ranked with the two big
state schools as having the most baautiful
campus in Iowa. Dllring the summer many
improvements were made possible by the
administration so that Grinnell yet maid
tains her reputation. Among the many ime
provements, the following have been noticed
by the editorial board this yea .
1. The building of an entirely new quar-
ter mile track.
2. The reconditioning and repainting ol'
the stadium.
3. The painting of the women’s gym.
4. The repainting ol' the house of the
Dean of Men’s office.
. Sidewalks all over the campus repaired
and rebuilt.

. Wall along the dormitory loggia clean-

. New walk to the book . ore.

, A new allweather tennis court.

. Rcslll'lacillg of all the clay tennis
courts.

. A much improved arrangement of the
library including the closing off 01’ the
entrance from the AILH.

11. Campus roads gl-nded.

While most of these in‘lprovelnents are
small, the sum total is important.

improvements of any kind whct the tie
sire for more ol‘ the some; and yet, perhaps,
it would not be too condescending [or Grins
ncll college students to evidence more than
passive appreciation ol’ the benefits already
received,

our POLICY: Aﬁllilil's Gltlllllul

The editorial board has adopted the slogan:
“Make Grinnell a better place [or students!”

Any college is, of course, a place for a
student. But this college is the place for
the Grinnell student, and there Is a dis-
tinction! The Grinnell student does not
merely study; he also is interested in drama,
and movies, music, athletics, publications,
and dates, foreign affairs and campus “af-
fairs”.

The Grinnell type of student develops
into the best citizen and the happiest per—
son, simply because hc has interested him-
self in the host that a liberal arts college
can offer. He is unconsciously a scholar
of life,

Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten
that the Grinnell student is primarily a
student! He has come to college not merely
to mature under the most auspicious cir-
cumstances, but also to sift froln abundant
sources the facts and experiences which
will be of most future use, and which are
of most present interest, He may know
when he comes what fields the facts and
experiences he desires are ill, or he may
come to discover those fields.

Knowledge of, or discovery of, his pain
ticular fields of interest, however, docs not
exclude the Grinnellian from all other fields
of human activity. On the contrary, as the
"Grinnell student”—the person interested in
all aspects of living—he is actually involved
in all the other fields.

This ideal student is, of course, only par
tially realized now. The editorial board is
anxious to preserve all factors now existing
which further the ideal, but it also wants
to see them improved and new ones invent-
ed. Some of the factors which the editorial
board encourages are:

A larger moiety of social affairs.
Enforcement of “quiet hours."
Chapel attendance,

Higher standards of “ptcmn'ttg.”
Interest in ctti'l'mtt affairs.

More support for the teams.

. Strict examination procedure.

With these points in mind, we say:
“Make Grinnell a still better place for the
Grinnell student!"

THE EDITORIAL BOARD.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

ducatlon exists not merely so that the
ri ing generation may face, discuss, and, if
possible, decide questions basic to political
society and human life. It exists also to
provide the highest goods themselves It
exists to foster moral, intellectual and spir-
itual growth. Its results should be a sound
character, a disciplined mind, and an elevat—
ed spirit." University of Chicago Pres.
Robert M. Hutchins eloquently describes the
great ends of higher education.

G

“I want my son to go to a school where they
teach all forms of government, I want him
to know all there is to know about Commulr
ism, Fascism and Socialism, as well as repre-
sentative forms of government. I want him
to know all the good and the bad points of
all these theories of government, as they
have been worked out in actual practice in
the past and in the present.” Alf M. Lon-
don, 1936 Republican presidential nominee,
votes unequivocally for freedom in educa-
tion.

———By William G. Harris,

Only four weeks of hellrand-hlglie
water in Europe, and already the
international lial's' contest is in
run swing Only at month or ac-
tivc hostilities, and it has reached
a pomt where a person can hardly
believe his own mother.

For many a your uow, llerr
ilillcr bus held the bare chum-
piouslup or the worm, but at
present om- mustached “men-
ace" and his plupmntc, Goob-
liels, are being hard prcsscrl

ment, the British mill French

is only tnir to add, however,
that the German boys bid rail-
to reluiu their position in spite
or the stiff competition.)
Already we in America have
been favored With a second Lusi»
tania bloodrcurdlcr, the “brutal”
sinking of the Albania, with the
usual nearer-ending cry, “Amer-
ican lives taken on the high seas,”
And already we have been regal-
ed with tales of Polish atrocities
committed upon the poor, peace-
loving Nazis in Poland. We have
heard of Mr. Goering's famous
collection of nudes, seen pictures
ot starving Polish prisoners and
bombed hospital trains, and role
lowed tear-Jerking nightmares of
the massacre of women and Chile
dl'en in Warsaw, Then, to top it
on. we have read, side by side,
the two accounts of a see battle
in wincn Bcrnn claims to have
sunk ouc battleship and damaged
others witlicut losing a plane and
in which London claims to have
shot down two or more Ger-men
planes without surterlng :1 cas-
ualty.

or coursc, the obvious moral
to he armm irom the recital of
these instances is this: point
believe everything you sec or
beer lrom the cnpltuls ot the
warring countries. However,
there are other factors to be
considered in this problem be-
sides the obvious, one of them
being thc fact that Britain and
Frunce control the most direct
menus or communications to

tllis collmry.

Tbs: means that British releases
got here quicker, are thus
“fresher” news than those coming
from Germany, and‘are conse-
quently splashed across our news
papels in screaming headlines. 0n
the other hand, in most cases by
the time the German version
reaches the editor's desk it is all
the way from a belt a clay to
several days older than the Brite
isli story, and hence receives the
lesser notice givcn to “stale”
news, to wit: the Athenia story.
Furthermore, sccoruing to u re-
cent poll of leading newspapers,
the press of the country is al-
most 100 per cent pro-ally, and
is naturally inclined to give
Britnllrs stuff tnc benefit of the
doubt. ,
