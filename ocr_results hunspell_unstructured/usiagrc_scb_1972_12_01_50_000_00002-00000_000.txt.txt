December I, 1971

by Janet Schuldiner

ISPlRG's ilrst project has been
completed with the removal of six
toys banned by the Food and Drug
Administration from local stores.
Four students recently surveyed an
equal number of stores and discov-
ered toys that were banned still
being sold. Although all the stores
carry some toys that are considers
ed dangerous, only two had banned
toys, in both cases the managers
promptly removed the banned toys.
Sharp spikes, pins and small ob-
jects that are easy to swallow were
the most frequent hazards discov»
ered among the dangerous and ban-
ned toys. ISPIRG workers were sur—
prised to discover so many banned
toys in Grinnell alter a group in
Minneapolis surveyed 41 stores and
found only 1'7 banned toys,

since an estimated 700,000 children
will be injured by toy-related acci-
dents in the u 3 this year, leas
ving more than 40,000 permanently
crippled and 19,000 dead, ISPlRG’s
aim was to complete this study he»
lore the Christmas rush and get
the banned toys oil the market,
in addition, managers wereinlorm-
ed about other harmiul toys that
are very similar to the banned toys.
in all iour surveyed stores toys
considered hazardous continue to be
sold. lSPlRG has no legal course
or action against dangerous toys
other than ihiorming the public at
the harmiul aspects oi them, so
through the local media and possir
ble speaking engagements ISPIRG
workers will soon be disseminating
their iindings in Grinnell.

ISPIRG Prepares legislative Monitoring

leggett Protests Athletic De-Emphosis

by Don bagenais

1‘ 'Presid'ent Glenn Leggett‘has res
ently addressedia letter to fair
low Presidents oi Midwest Athletic
Conierence schools concerning the
relationship between Conierence
athletic rules and the academic and
emotional environment of member
colleges The letter, written in re—
sponse to a recent decision by the
Conference not to allow Grinnell to
use one oi its admissions counsels
iors at a part- ime coach, contends
that a continuing tie—emphasis olins
tercollegiate athletics may begin to
seriously aliect the composition and
atmosphere of the schools involved.

Faculty representatives and ath—
letic directors of the Conference den
cided November 18 by a vote of 971
that to allow a Grinnell admissions
counselor to serve as a coach would
violate the Conference agreement
that coaches are not to be used in
admissions work except under very
precise restrictions. The Confer
ence policy is an extension, accor—
ding to Leggett, oi the philosophy
that athletics and recruiting should
remain strictly separate.

“I believe the dezemphasis of ins
lercollegiate athletics can he car-
ried to the point Where it affects
much more than the attitude oimany
of the alumni who support us,”
Leggett Wrote, “It may affect the
health of our institutions as resi»

dential, independent institutions
which are constantly being driven
to dverlylhomogenous and single—
image institutions, a drive that
makes it difficult to present the di-
versity we need to attract the var-
iety of students out [ac

iety or students and faculty that we
are going to need in the years
ahead.”

Because of the rising cost of C017
lege, Leggett elaborated in an 5&8
interview Thursday, colleges such
as the MAC schools “are losing the
middle income group ” Students
tend to be either “uppersmiddle-
class" and able to pay the tuition,
or from a less advantageous econos
mic situation Where they need sub
stantial aid. While the recruiting
oi athletes is not ”the crucial ele
ment” in the problem, he said, it
does “play a part i believe we Cans
not aliord to ignore."

Although economic diversity will
not guarantee intellectual diversity,
“we would have a healthier envil‘s

Leggett therefore recommended in
the letter that the Midwest Athler

Hours Limit Deboted

by Merry Wiesner

Tuo proposals tor the extension
oi the 4Bshour departmental credit
limitlitlon are now being considered.
One \\ill come up heiorc the they
pity on Monday, and the other has
been returned to tthumanities EFC
tor iui-tlier consideration, and will
come up bciore the laculty at a lot-
er date.

The iiist proposal involves the in»
iroductory language courses, which
usually lllnollnt to lo ciedits, which
greatly reduces the number oi
upperslevcl courses which a student
in these departments may take The
original proposal requested that
these courses not count toward the
limit in all language departments,
but was amended iu the Executive
Council to Just include the Rus—
sian uhd Classics Dop' tnienis

The rationale behind this was the
tact that most language majors come
here with advanced placement, ex—
cept in Russian and direct. us many
high schools do not other these lnn—
guoges Russian majors are partic-
ulaily concerned lllioul ioreign
study piogranis, such asthe Lenillgr
rail Program. which mean on entire
semester‘s credits are in Russian.

The Fine Arts proposal. \tllicll has

gone back to the divisional EPC,
recommends an increase in the de~
partmental credit limit ior Fine Arts
to so credits. Both Music and Art
are interested, ior both departments
Offer courses in essentially differs
enl areas, art in history and studio
art, and music ill theory, performs
ance, and practicum. it is tell that
a student must have experience in all
at those areas to really have a
grounding in the hold, and that the
K18 hour limitation is unrealistic bee
cause of the number of courses
involved in each area

Music students in particular have
gone over tile 48 hour limitation in
the past, particularly because ofthe
credits given ior nillsic lessons,
which may amount to as may as 16
Art students feel that many various
niedliuns must be explored in the
studio program do llol allow ior ads
vanced specialization and llldepclls
dent work in one particular medium,
ii an adequate program oi art hlS*
tory courses is also assumed
Faculty consideration must take
many vleupoints ililo account. as
