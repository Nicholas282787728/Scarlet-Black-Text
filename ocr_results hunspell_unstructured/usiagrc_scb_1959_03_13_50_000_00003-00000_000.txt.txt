is, but if it isn't, shouldn't we

revert to the cumbersome Sys-
tem of earlier hours with “late
pars" and “late minutes?"

The second experiment deals
with open lounges with “cv-
eryone welcome." This is a
principle in which we believe,
but when there are couples i
embracing long and passion.
ately, casual daters are em-
barrassed and go into tar eor-
ners or decide not to enter the
lounge at all. There is one
lounge in the Quadrangle, for
example, frequently monopo-
lized by one couple in prone
position on the davenport. I
have seen other couples enter,
take one look, and tiptoe out,
Furthermore, it is not the en»
gaged couples, apparently, who
are at fault. Evidently they
are sure of each others love
and usually do not need to
make public spectacles of their
love-making.

A common complaint of col—
ic e women is the lack of casual
d ting. They say that unless,
they “go steady" they don't,

lege men think this is ltrue, for
there are many attractive, per-
sonable, dateless Women, Do the
men think it the thing to do to
offer the woman a pin or ring
after a 'date or two? They need
not.

There are many women who
would be delighted with only a
study date at the library and a
coke afterward in the Union.
Don’t be embarrassed by the ar-
dent behavior of a few highly
visible couples and think of ii:
as the usual, expected behavior.

New for the big question~
what about open dormitory
rooms? Frankly we are afraid
of them. Surely the uninhibr
ited, passionate embrace would
go further within private ,
rooms sanctioned by the college.
And surely the casual daters
would be embarrassed more
than they are now. Consider,
alas, the fate or the non—dater.
He or she would lose even the
privilege of free access to his
or her mom, must remain
fully clothed. and could not
dash to bathroom or shower
in dishabillc. Oberlin college
tried the plan recently and
banned it, taking the stand

’ that it is under no obligation
to provide private petting ,
places for couples.

Should or can we expect bet-
ter behavior from our students”
From the lack of social respon<
sibilitv displayed in our limited
experiments i believe not. My
original premise is this: we
should grant freedom ‘to stu-
dents in direct proportion rto
their social awareness, but that
freedom must end if it en—
croaclie: upon the health. wel-
fare, or happiness of other stu-
dents. lt is an unfortunate fact
that rules and regulations needed‘

limit the activities of all,
