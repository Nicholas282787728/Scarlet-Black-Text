Speakeasy

Opinion

Readers critique writers:

only first

step towards reform

Now that my threerday rush of
adrenaline has subsided, I feel that
t can finally record my thoughts on
Monday night's Concerned Black
Students‘ Speakeasy. My initial
impressions are of pride and
satisfaction because what we did
was extremely difficult but come
pletely essential to the knowledge
of the residents of this campus. I
think we all accomplished what we

Luc Hatlestad

, set out to do I also think that we
were all pleased, and perhaps
slightly surprised. at the positive
reaction we received from the aur
dience, We were going into the
presentation expecting the worst,
but the students and faculty seem-
ed to be responsive to our views.

Without reiterating too much, I
saw the central theme of the
Speakeasy as being an issue of the
whites‘ ignorance of the racism
present at Grinnell. The
misconception seems to be that
there is none. or there is an in»
consequential amount. and that the
black students and faculty don't
have a whole lot to complain about.
What has to be realized is that
there don't have to be Whites call~
ing blacks "nigger," or a cross
burning in front of the BCCin order
for there to be racism in Grinnell.
There also shouldn’t be a need for a
Speakeasy to make everyone
aware of the problem. Something
like what happened Monday night
should provide an increased
awareness of something already
evident, but I know that a great
many people left in virtual shock
over what they heard.

I tended to put most of the blame
for my ignorance on the ad-
ministration. Obviously, if I want
to do something about racism a.

Decision to

lam going to make a prediction.
1 usually leave this to the super-
market tabloids, but I am relative»
ly sure this one will turn out cor
rect. Ginsberg will not become our
next Supreme Court justice 1 also

will make the prediction that the
Republicans will not be able to
blame only propaganda this time,
This prediction is a bit riskier
because there may be some pro
paganda. However, propaganda
will not be Ginsberg's major
downfall.

Propaganda is certainly possi-
ble. Ginsberg did operate one of
the nation's first dating services
after he finished college. His wife,
a doctor. did perform abortions
during her medical training in
Boston from 1979 to 1930 And, most
importantly, Ginsberg decided to
Dreside over a case on First

sexism or gay rights, must of die
impetus will have to come from my
own motivation. But I don’t think
that the school has fulfilled its
responsibility in telling me what
my options are. such as taking the
Black Sociology class or joining
Students to End Apartheid. Given
the profound lack of such options,
it doesn't seem like a lot to ask of
the administration to give the
students that information,

rm a junior and i hope to spend a
semester in Europe next year, so i
only have a little over one year left
on campus. it would be easy at this
point just to say the hell with the
administration and its core curs
riculum, its number 10, its little-
regardrforethercurrentrstudents
management of the endowment. in
actuality, most of the changes tak
ing place or being proposed now
will have little or no effect on me.
But the fact that I'm not only a
white male. but a white male with
a byline, allows me to make things
change in this society 1 wasn't
aware of how true this is until I
took the Introduction to Black
Sociology class and thus became
involved in the Speakeasy. i want
to rid myself of my racist at»
tiludes, and in doing that, I will
have the black students as my
allies, But their . assistance is
almost incidental because as a
group they hold very little power.
The ones i really need help from
are whites, specifically white
males, specifically‘ white ad-
ministrative males. They are the
people with the power to institute
change.

Last year, hardly a week went by
without a story in the S and B about
the gay students' struggle for
equal rights. They ended up receiv»
ing a great deal oi their demands,
Maybe this is what has to be done
to change the racial atmosphere on
campus, To be sure, if i see
anything in that area worthy of
change, it will be discussed in this
column.

 

Luc: not a
terrible person

To the Editor:

Although I intended my first let-
ter to the editor to be on another
subject, 1 would like to briefly res
pond to Luc Hadestad's “Fust Im-
pmsions: the dean. of an infan
Basically, I just want to make two
quick points, First, Luc seems to
fixate in his article on an explana-
tion of death that religious parents
commonly give to their children.
Unfortunately, most parents don’t
wish to take the time to explain the
complexities of death to their
children, so they simply say that
God “needed Johnny" or “needed
Maggie" in heaven, The simple
truth is that, if you believe in God,
you can never assume that you are
able to understand all the things he
does or doesn't do. You don't have
to be religious to realize that imr
perfect minds can not possibly fulr
1y understand the reasoning or
motives of a being who is supposed
to be perfect.

Second, realize that one reason
people fear and hate death so much
is because of the way it affects
themselves. No matter how you
look at death, the dead person
could care less. From the
Atheist‘s perspective, the deceas-
ed just ceases to exist and
therefore no longer feels anything,
let alone concern about their
death. From the Christians
perspective. the soul goes to
heaven where it has eternal hap-
piness. Therefore. when people
grieve about someone's death,
they are grieving for their own
loss.

Luc, note that throughout your
article you discuss how the death
affected yourself. your aunt. and
your uncle. Never did you mention
the baby's lost future or any other
similar such thing. This doesn't
mean that you're a terrible person,
It’s only natural to react that way.
But realize. your family is grieving
for its own loss of happiness not the
baby's. And to become mad, at
God or any other person tor the

Hailestad than ked

To the Editor:

I thank Luc I-Iatlestad for sharr
ing his feelings with us in his arti-
cle, “First impressions: The
Death of an Infant.” I’m sure it
was difficult to do. He came across
as very angry 7 and has every
right to be. As I read the article, I
sensed Luc's frustration in just try-
ing to put the intense feelings
resulting from such an unjust
death into words. This proves to be
an impossible task. Anger is a
crucial stage in the grief process.
and the most difficult many times.
i can understand his feelings
because i lost a ten year old sister
to cancer, and like Luc, my family
is also Catholic. My first reaction
to anyone who told me it was
“God's will" or that God “needed
her in heaven" went beyond anger.
It became rage, Yet. I think Luc
Hatlestad fails to understand the
importance of all religious beliefs
at times of crisis

Humans are extremely rational
beings 7 many times too rational.
Rut try rationalizing the
premature death of a six month old
or a ten year old, You just can't.
I’ve tried. Not ironically, some of
the most rational and logical pens
ple in the world are also the most
religious, Some things just don't
make sense. The role of the
Catholic Church. as well as other
religious institutions. is to provide
some means of coping with events
that don't make sense. Religious
beliefs in heaven. the afterlife, etc.
continue to comfort grieving pear
ple, giving them some sense of con-
trol again, helping them overcome
guilt. giving them a sense of hope
and providing some basis for ex
plaining the otherwise unex-
plainable. Many times religious
faith has helped those who have
lost a child, especially an only
child, to find the courage to have
more children. This is a healthy
way to cope.

One of the most dangerous and
unhealthy things one can do is to

nominate Ginsberg will backfire

Amendment rights for cable TV
companies. He did this while he
owned a large amount of shares in
Rogers Communications lnc., a
cable company with over 450,000
subscribers in six states. Although
Ginsberg wasn't actually breaking
any criminal ”conflict of
interests" law, since this cable
company wasn't a direct partici-
pant in the case, Rogers Coma
munications Inc. clearly benefited
from the decision. While these
three incidents could easily be the
sources for a large amount of pro
paganda. this tactic is not needed
to defeat the nomination. All that
needs to be done is to remind the
Republicans what they said during
the nomination proceedings for
Bork.

in these nomination battles over
Robcrt Bork, the one Republican
protest that was yclled over and
over again ibesides “liberal pros
paganda”) was that Rork was the
highest-qualified judge Reagan
could have selected. Robert Bork‘s
experience could not be argued,
they claimed, and therefore he
should be nominated. To the
Republicans, experience was
everything, individual opinions
were nothing They felt that the

direction our country's policies
took meant nothing as long as our
Justices had had enough ex
perience. i say let’s play the
Republicans game. They have dug
their grave; let us now bury them
in it.

We shall ignore Ginsberg's
policies. He has made so few declr
sions that this should not be dif-
ficult tnobody knows what he
stands for). However, this is the
exact reason the Senate should
veto the nomination. Ginsberg is
not qualified, He is only 41, would
be the youngest Justice in this cen-
tury, and does not have the ex,
perience that would qualify him for
a seat on the highest court in the
land. Before we analyze a Supreme
Court nominee's policies, we must
establish that he is at least
qualified for the job. In the
nomination process, the Senate
should first look at qualifications,
and if and only if he passes this
test, then they should look at the
pOIiCIES of the individual. Bork
passed the first test but not the se,
cond. Ginsberg doesn‘t even pass
the first, so we don't have to look at
the second. He doesn't deserve a
seat on the Supreme Court.

Some people might question his

lack of experience. He is presently
a judge on the us. Circuit Court of
Appeals, and a 41-yearrold is old
enough for most jobs. so why not
the Supreme Court? The answer
lies in that the Supreme Court is
the highest and most powerful
court in the nation. Its duty is to in
terpret the Constitution, which is
the ”highest law of the land,” This
is not a small job that just anybody
is qualified for. if our country is to
remain strong, the balance of
power has to remain stabilized. A
weak judicial branch will lead to
an overpowering executive or
legislative branch. This could easi-
ly lead to disaster, Our Supreme
Court judges must therefore be the
best judges in the land. Ginsberg
hasn't made enough decisions for
us to know how good he is, Reagan
may think Ginsberg's lack of decir
sions is an advantage if Democrats
can’t pin any dirt on him. but he
seems to havehad a lapse of
memory (as he otten doesl and
forgotten how much he emphasiz»
ed experience during the Bork
nomination process. His decision
will backfire, and Ginsberg will not
be nominated. No propaganda is
necessary. -

Berger likened
‘to James Joyce

To the Editor:

Last week's editorials criticizing
Brian Berger's reviews were effeCr
tive. They proved that conser-
vatism and ignorance are in fact
complementary.

To use Deanna Bickford's own
words, “I encourage [her] to wake
up, smell the coffee, and expand
[her] horizons a bit" by exposing
herself to different types of jour-
nalism. ls Gonzo journalism or any
other nontraditional type of
journlism beyond her horizons”
And if Thomas Beverly and Ms.
Bickford feel that Berger's “cool
style of writing does not belong in
supposedly esteemed college
publications such as the Scarlet
and Black," perhaps they should
restrict their reading material w
The Christian Science Monitor,
Newsweek, and Golf Digest.
Bickford and Beverly must skip
over the Hunter S, Thompson ar-
ticles in Rolling Stone and refuse to
read the conclusion of James
Joyce’s “Ulysses" in English
class.

Anyway, their ludicrous accusa-
tions that Berger’s irreverent
writing style is too offensive are
poorly supported, in fact, they are
quite foolish. For example, Mr.

Ehrlich slammed

To the Editor:

1 vehemently object to Grant
Ehrlichs' Column, The Inhuman
Element, in last weeks‘ S and B.
The column is insulting to in
dividual members of the Men's
Cross Country team and to the
team as a whole. It is factually in-
accurate, greatly exaggerated in
many ways, and contains outright
fabrications.

Mr, Ehrlich has no business
whaMever dacribing teammates
underwear and/or anatomy on the
pages of the s and B or openly in-
sulting studenB at the Grinnell
High School. He should learn to
think before he writes.

The title of the column borders
on plagiarism, and the style of
writing is akin to that of a dime
novel. It is unfortunate that such
shabby journalism was not purged
by the editor. 7 Paul W. Budlong
