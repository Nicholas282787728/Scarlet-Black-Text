Brick (2005)
*ttﬁﬁ

High schooler becomes
hard-bailed sleuth

III Rinn Johnson's film Brie-Ar, the
phrase “it's complicated" takes on a
whole new meaning In regards to the
movie's tilin noit poltlaynl ot adoles-
ccnt romance and schoolyard d ni.
Set in a iuoderneday Southern Calr
tornin neighborhood, the movie bcgms
enigmatically with the bespectacled but
steely-eyed loner Brendan Frye (Jo-
seph Gordonthvitt of 3rd Ruth/ram
2/7: Sim fume) crouching and staring at
the dead body ofhis ex-girlfriend, Ems
ily (Emilie de Ravin). The film cuts to
Brendan receiving a inysteiious note
in his locker, then to him talking on a
payphone with Emily, who sounds very
much alive. She frantically tells him
that she’s in trouble and hangs up the
phone abruptly, leaving Brendan with
four seemingly unrelated words: Brick,
Tug, Pin and Frisco.

Brendan sets out, with the help
of his only friend, The Brain (Matt
O'Leary), to ﬁnd out the meaning or
Emily's message and decipher the mo
tives behind her murder. He soon int
volves himself in a dangerous paper
chase that leads him deep into his high
school's social strata and the suburban
underworld.

The film’s strength lies in Johnson's
keen ability to render both subtly and
hyperbolically the caricatures that
compose a relatablc suburban land
scape. Despite some plot holes, the
story engages the audience, and we
enjoywatching Brendan sleuth and sift
through social cliques tor clues, using
both his fists and his snappy sense or
repattee.

For example, attet leceiving a lead
from temme tatale and upper-crust so-
cialite Laura (Nora Zehetner),Brcndan
hits the streets and heads to an isolated
back alley behind his hometown delica»
tessen to confront a local deadbeat, the
Billy Idol—csque Dode (Noah segan),
and his band of cronies. After rought
ing up Dode, Brendan responds to the
rest of the gang, and arguably to every
enemy ofhis,with a threat: “Throw one

The Little Mermaid
(1989)

****ﬁ

Ursula not an octopus

What movie features singing fish,
stereotypical French chefs and a plot
you couldn't even stick a fork into her
cause i’ so overdone? That‘s Iight!
Disney’ '17: Lil/Ir Mermaid, the 1989
featurCtleugth animated picture which
kicked off a renaissance and decoder
long string of successes for the Disney
animation studios.

Most children of the ’80: will be
familiar with the plot. Dissatisﬁed
princess longs for a better life with
studly prince type, but overbearing pat
rental ﬁgure says “no dice." Disobedi-
ent twerp of a girl falls in wrth a bad
squidtwoman (that's right, squid, not
octopus, Octopi have eight tentacles,
squids have six. Count ‘emD, who then
ropes girl into convoluted scheme. Girl
and studly prince join forces to stop
convoluted scheme. Happy ending had
by all, except for dead squidavoman.

What I've always liked about TIM
Lil/’4' Mermaid is the music I’m not
too proud to deny that I was sing
ing along to “Under The Sea" when
it played. Aftei all, it’s not every day
you get to sing along with a Rastafai-
ian crah, or listen to a seagull start to
Squawk Tchaikovsky's “Romeo and Jut
liet."l laughed with macabie glce when
the sadistic chcfciiecl out In song "Now
I stuff you with bi'cadl/ It don't hurt,
'cause you're dcad'" I personally feel
that all movies could stand to beneﬁt
from a sadist In some sort of nontsocial
job. Imagine a sadistic groundskeeper
or librarian, for instance.

Animationtwiseuhcmovie has been
restored digitally, and it’s still breath
taking even in an age where something
like Finding Nmio has set the bar for
underwater scenery. It's definitely
“hotter under de water" here.

My only gripe with the movie Is that
it's starting to show its age, something a

great movie should never need to worry
aboutl Yes, the music is still great, and
the animation Is still pretty spectacular.
But come on, even by Disney standards
the story is cliche’, and one that’s been
repeated many times hetore and otter
this movie's creation.

Otherwise, the movie is a gem. I
know that it’s a Dive-In Movie, Incan-

PEC to watch it, but dammit, it's T/JL‘

of those movies you’ie always thinking

stolen, and he blames Mr. Krabs, owner
or the Krusty Crab. The only way to
save Mr. Krabs from execution is for
SpongeBob to successfully return the
crown to the king in spite ofeveryone’s
insistence that it is a job for a Inan.
And so the adventure begins.

Punctuated by song and dance
numbers, the movie is basically an 87
minute long TV episode. To those
who enjoy the Nickelodeon show that
spawned an empire, the movie is cute.

I personally enjoy watching an epis
sode from time to time, but the movie
is cheerful almost to the point of be
ing annoying. I made the mistake of
watching it during my only fiee time,
nine o'clock in the mom g, an endean

Thankfully the utndoni appearance

Despite its status as a children’s
movie, Spoiigvlieb examines some inn
pol'tﬂnt themes including that of the
transition from boy to man. so promi-
nent is this theme, in fact, that some
might even call Sponchob an astute
commentary about the restrictive defl’
