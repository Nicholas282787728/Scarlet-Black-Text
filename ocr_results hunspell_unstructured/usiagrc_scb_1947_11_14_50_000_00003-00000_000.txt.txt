toughest game of the season Sat—l
iirday oftcrnoon as they renew‘
an old rivalry with Washiiigton‘
university. St, Louis. The Bears,
playing their first regular sea-
son since 19412, have dedicated
the Saturday contest as their
homecoming ‘game It will be
their last home mcct of the sea-

toughest yet faced by the Plan-‘
eers.

Oakes‘ team has been banal»?

The Pioneers, stinging from an‘
18 to 13 loss at Carleton lastl
week, will be out for a win to
close their season. Grinnell's rec-
ord thus far stands at three wins
and four losses,
