Griffey’s move to Cincinnati
raises questions about player
trading in professional sports

Norm Brodly

that captured the headlines this
month was [l'lkt Cincinnati Reds

Ken Griffey, Jr.

Whar is going on in rhe world
ofprofessional sports? Never before
have supersranlevel players
ohanged reams so frequently. Alex
Rodriguez is also on the trading
block and Juan Gonzalez reoenrly
moved ro the DerroirTrgers. Now,
I know baseball’s all-time grtntcst
player, Babe Ruth, was rraded in
the prime oreareer. But rhe circum»
srances rhar dietare change in‘
today's marker eeonomies are rar
different [lmn (h: reason Mr. Ruth
was tradedithal the Red Sox have
always been run by a huneh or

Neal smirh, Hardy Nlolrerson, Ben

Andre Reedr '

Ninesfigurc eonrraers have
changed rho enrire sporrs worlds
and, once again, it’s rhe Fans who
are gerring screwed

So who can we blame for this
tragedy?

Let’s blame rhe owners—rhey

wrarh. But rhey haven’r done any»

rhmg wrongiwho wouldn’r jump
ar rhe ehanee ro acquire a player or
megasrar status? And ifyou remove

ar things obieerivsly, ralring a
ehanso on a drarr pick may be a
berrer srraregy rhan paying a king:
ransom for an esrablished sraHsr,
worse yer, a srar in deeline.

So lers blame it on rhe orher
parry—rhe players. But rhey are
clearly as innoeenr as rhe owners on
rhis one. They have lirrls control
over wherher rhey ger rraded or if
rhey are released, They are rhe ones
who have played rheir enrire career

In some ways, sports in the 1990‘s
