I .‘Péri ,ie 7
’tfaime (2006)

Appealing though dlSr
connected collection

Pam. jg t’m‘mc is a strange but ofr
ten wonderful little concoction, It's
like ﬂipping through a book of poetry,
picking out words and sentences as the
pages turn.

Assembled by Emmanuel Benbihy
with an ensemble cast of directors and
actors, it is a series of 18 short films
that take place in Paris, Each short is
selfrcontained and the variety is trer
mendous r the directors run the gamut
from Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like
BNUMM) to the Coen brothers (Fargo).
Expect to see some well-known actors
crop up, as well as some smaller names
and foreign actors who don’t enjoy as
much recognition in the US:

Similarly, the content of the films
spans a wide range, Each film deals
with love in some form, but that's
where the similarities end. We see new
love, old love, maternal love, rekindled
love, lost chances at love or just love
that is barely materialized, so {rim that
we aren’t even sure it's there. Some of
the films are Light, others poignant.
Some are straightforward, complete
storylines, others only tantalizing fragr
merits of lives.

It’s hard to make any sort of claim
that applies to everything in Paris, j:
(’m‘me. it's too varied, too heteroge-
neous, to lead to any pat conclusions.
This may well be the only way to truly
tackle a subject like the city of Paris any
more. The days of simple caricatures or
the City of Love are gone, and part of
the movie’s strength lies in the plethora
of nuance found as we ﬂit from locale
to locale, getting glimpses of people
from all walks of life.

That said, it would be nice to have
some narrative threads to follow be-
tween vignettes. Some attemptis made
at tying together the different stories,
but it still has the feel of a collection of
individual ﬁlms, like the final products
of a filmrmaklng class project, rather
than a cohesive whole. Even given this
complaint, it's worth going [or the best
ones — Oliver Schmitz’ heartbreaking
Place dei file: and the Coen brothers’
darkly humorous Toilet-its spring to
mind. And maybe you’ll ﬁnd a few that

surprise you a little, make you think
about life and love a little differently.

Hairspray I
(2007): ’

Cute revamp of camp classic

A remake of john Waters' 1988
campy classic, Hait-rpnzy seemed im-
probable. How could anything he more
over the top than Divine sashaying
around the screen as Edna Turnblad?
Nothing,

Adam Shankman’s version of Han-
ipmy does not attempt to outrcamp
Watcrs'originril film. Instead, this 2007
release tells the story otTracy Turnblad
with a sweet earnestness that is touch-

ing without being overly saccharine.

A Baltimore teen who wants nothr
ing more than to dance on a local afr
ternoon variety show, Tracy manages
to get onto television with the help of
a group ofAfricanrAmerican students
she meets in detention. Led Seaweed
(Elijah Kelley), they are dancers on the
show's monthly Negro Hour. Present-
ed with the reality that her new friends
ate discriminated against, Tracy joins
the movement for integration, singing
all the way.

This version of Hairrpmy, it turns
out, isn’t really about Tracy so much
as the chamcters around her. Nikki
Blonsky does a commendable job as the
widereyed idealist, but the supporting
characters steal the screen. Qleen Latr
ifah as Negro Hour host Motnrmouth
Mnhel provides sass and wisdom while
ﬂexing her commanding voice in sev-

eral songs. Christopher Walken steps
lightrfootedly across the screen as Trar
ey’s father Wilbur, reminding fans that
he can, in fact, dance,

But no one in this film compares to
John Travolta, Cast as Tracy's mother
Edna,Travolta in drag is a sight to be
seen. The comedic shock value dis-
seminates relatively quickly, but Tra-
volta still hold audience attention as a
superior dancer. Clad in a rat suit and
propped up in high heels, he still manr
ages to glide across the screen with an
unexpected grace.

The movie works because it emr
braces exactly what it is. Its cutsie na
time work to its advantage. With the
help ora strong supporting cast and a
signiﬁcant message about acceptance,
Hmrrprtiy doesn't fail to leave a smile
on one's face.

Menomena: enjoy unconventional music-
making, but keep an eye on your girlfriend '

My girlfriend and l are in a monogamous relnr
tionship, with one caveat: either ofus can stray for a
member ofthe band Menomena.

The two times that we have seen
them, they have puton the most amazing
of shows. At south by southwest they
stood out as the best in the crowded line-
up of up-and-coming hands. And the
intimate setting of Gardner this Friday
will prove to be the perfect atmosphere
to sce this innovative group,

Menomena is a three member band from Portr
land, Ore Their music combines musical elements
that fade in and out throughout the course ofa song
while also maintaining strong melodies They create
experimental indie music that is innovative yet ncccse
sible.

This fact is especially impressive in light oftherr
computer-based recording process.The program takes
small riffs played by each band member and extends

each hook. They then use the program to combine
the different pieces together to form a coherent song,

already having completed the recording process.

Even though the hand may create the songs be
fore knowing how to play them live, their shows are
full nfenergy and successfully manage to bring their
multilayered .uusrc tn life. All three members orrhe
band share vocal duties on different songs, with no
one standing out above the rcstr Drummer Danny
Saint’s occasional hipchop - spired hours drive the
songs as the other two musicians on stage switch be-

tween various instruments.

Throughour the course of a single song, while
Brent Knopf is triggering midi files and playing a
gloekenspiel, the band’s third member Justin Harris
may switch between gu' r, bass and even saxophone.
While this would seem like it would create a disor-
ganized live show, the band members bring energy to
each song and make the switches appear seamless.

Even though their songs can at times be melanr
choly in sound, they bring excitement to them that
keeps you interested at a concert, Their songs often
start slow, building to an exhilarating climatic mar
merit (best marked by the times when Harris whips
out his sax) before breaking the tension and switching
to a new direction in the song.

Even though they may only be a three-piece unit,
the richness and variety ortheir sound can ﬁll a stage
and venue, making the close atmosphere of Gardner
perfect to hear the expanse of their sound.
