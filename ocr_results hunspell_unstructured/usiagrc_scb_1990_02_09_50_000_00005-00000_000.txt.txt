in tlte mountains.
. Theseisolated commur
nities were nearly de-
stroyed decades ago. when
coal miners coerced the Appala-
chian people to selltheirland,often
for very little money. After the land
was mined, the industry left, leav-
ing suetches of stripped land and
desolate. impoverished families.
These families needed help

Their land was ruined, they had no
income, and even in later years.
many homes were torn down be-
cause the Tennessee government
had sold the land from beneath the
houses.

The Appalachian Committee, a
group founded to answer this need.

Appalachian Committee visits
villages throughout the mountain

travels to the Appalachians three
times a year. Jen Brown, a member
of the committee, said that it began
in 1968 through achurch in Ames.
Iowa. She has gone to help out in
Jellico, Tennessee for the past six
years, and explained that the pro-
gram is not strictly charity.

“I ﬁrst thought it would be a
martyr thingﬁwe‘d give food and
cloutestethesepeopleandieelgood.
But I now see that we're helping
people help themselves. We show
them how to insulate their homes
and put siding on.“ Jan laughed

before continuing, “We had whole
families out pounding siding onto
their houses.“

Jen said that there is no speciﬁc
goal that the group tries to achieve.
She explained that the importance
lies with interacting with thepeopie,
and helping out in the literacy pro—
grams and shelters that are already
in place The shelters are neces-
sary, especially in the winter, be-
cause houses burn down regularly
due to the high use of wood stoves.
Thesestoves remain thesole source

of heat for these families

Fire is only one of the problems
that the Appalachian community
must deal with. The incidence of
incestisextremely high. With fami-
lies under much stress and living in
close quaners, child abuse is also
common Church organizations
take in the abused and molested
children who have been removed
from their homes by the state

The situation sounds hopeless,
but Jen is positive. Although most
oftheAppalachittn people inJellico

are on welfare, she cited one man
who refuses to be dependent on the
government: “He runs a sawmill
and is totally sell-sufficient That’s
a sign of hope right there.“

Jen plans on returning to stay in
the hollows again, and describes
how she thinks that the Appala-
chian Committee helps these
people the most. She said, “it’s so
imponantifor anybody—just to
know thatsomeone isthere to sup4
port you...that someone will be
there."
