Well, l’ve saved the best till last
Now I know that u all have lots t)I
work to do these cl 5, but so do I,
and besides ispent a lot of money
to get this movie here so you'd
better turn out in droves to see it

’And also laugh. And clap, If not.
well then just torget it, next
semesterali you're going to see are
movies with Dean Jones and a
bunch of animals in them, The film
i ivant you to be sure to see is
Woody Allen's epic comedy Lou-
antl Death.

Woody Allen is probably the best
comic iilmmaker around today.
tOkay, so I'll give Mel Brooks
second place, but it you're looking
for anything intellectual in Brooks
you’re barking up the wrong tree t
Allen‘s lllms have gotten better
and better, and I'm sure some day
they’ll have the same kind of status
as the films of the Marx Brothers,
Love tiiiti Death is Allen's latest
and perhaps best effort, It is the
story of Boris GrushenkoI a
reluctant draftee into the Russtan
army at the time oi the Napoleonic
wars. By accident Grushenko
becomesasort ofhero; the “young
coward all oi St. Petersburg is
talkingabout," “Not so young, "
rejoins Grushenko bravely. In the
Iramewurk til this elaborate
costume drama. Woody Allen as
Boris really plays himseli. in
contrast to tlie' rest at the action
which is played mostly straight
and historical. the result of his
bcltavior is hysterical.

I don't Want to over analyze the
lilin, but it's nice to know that
Allen's humor is multirleveled. He
is adept at slapstick The stvord he
nears at his side in one scene keeps
poking people behind him every
time he bows to ilic ladies ii

 

)ou've ever seen the Three Stooges
try to handle it long board, you'll
realize that the principle involved
here is much the same. Oil the
other hand. AllL'Il can be terribly
intellectual There Lire so many
references to Russian literature in
this tilm that you should probably
get two credits [or watching it, All
oi the plots, the subplots, and most
01' the characters in tlic film are
strangely reminiscent of those
lound in Tolstoy, Chekov. and
Dostoyevsky In fact, one 01 the
liilal Scenes in the movie is ii
dialogue between Boris and his
father that is made up almost
entirely oi titles at Dostoyevksy's
works. Woody Allen also knows his
Iilm history Well enough to put all
sorts oi visual jokes parodying
famous Russian lilms into his
movie. Watch tor the “montage"
eiieet showing three carvings ni
stone lions; it's straight irom
Eiscilstein‘s classtc l'ilm
Pateiiiki Lore and Death's iinal
scene is iraight irom Bergman's
The Sl‘i‘l‘lllll Seal. Even Allen's use
of Prokofiev's infectious tune
“Troika” is suspiciously similar to
Eisenstein’s use of a Prokofiev
score lil his film [will the Terrible.

The lemulc lead in Love and
Death is played heautiiully by
Diane Keaton, who is in some ways
a better comic actor than Allen,
iier uiiderplayen, philosophical
acting as Sonia is a joy to watch,
and like Allen she can handle the
slapstick This movie is wonderful
to watch. filled with 5“th
elaborate sets, anachronism,
music. and a lot at earthy Russian
peasant types it you miss this
him. I‘ll never ioi-give you
