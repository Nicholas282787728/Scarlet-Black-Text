Crinnelrs Pioneei-s plunged in»
to stiff workouts this week, point-
ing for the Homecoming test
against the league-leading Law-
rence team Saturday. Oct. 19.
There was nothing out cheer in
the Pioneer camp despite last
week's defeat rind the tough foe
foi- Hunlecoming.

Coach Ben Douglas considered
his team improved in all respects
last Saturday, even though they
were nosed out by Monmouth's
Scots 12 to 7. The worst feature
in the Grinnell play was tackling.
but the Pioneers were beaten by
a. pass interception which was
run so yds. for a Scot touchdown
and was the decisive break in
the ‘game.

Crinnoll will need plenty of im-
provement to challenge the Law-
rence outfit which smothered
Knox 39 to 0 last iveek and wal—
loped Carleton 34 to 13 the week
before. On comparative scores
Lawrence has a 45 point margin
over the Pioneers, who lost to
Knox 18 to 9.

Grinncll's “B” squad gridders
dropped a 14 to o decision to
Central-s “B” team last night in
a, game at Pclla, 1a.. which wasl
finally called in the last quarter
because of excessive rain.
Throughout the contest intermit-
tent showers fell. and each team
risked only one forward pass with
the slippery hall.

Grinncll dominated the play in
the first half, and at one time
drove deep into Dutchmen terri-
tory, only to be repulsed. The
Pioneer attack was sp'\'l<ed by a
35 yd. run by Bonyata. After
taking the openingkickoff of the
second half on their own 20 yd.
line, the Pioneers lost ths ball on
a fumble ,and Central cashed in
for its first counter. Later in the
some period the Dutchmen scored
sn'other touchdown.

in the final period rain began
to descend ln deluges. and after
Grinnell lost two points on a
safety while trying to get a
punt off against the elements.
the game was called.

with the exception of Manly at
right half, Grinnell started a
freshman [can]. The starting line-
up included: Bridghxm, left end:

John C. Trllesdale, director of.’

physical education at Crinnell,
and basketball coach here from
l927 until 1940, ‘l‘fably told me
a few of the highlights of Grin-
ncll's hhskethall h tory yesterday
afternoon. Mr Trucsdalc, in
charge of conditioning for all‘
men, is in perfect shape himself,
despite his graying hair. and ob-
viously enjoyed recalling the ex~
ploits of some of his boys of
other days.

In 1900, what is now the worn-l
en's gym was built, and the PL
onecrs began a proud 42 years of
basketball competition in tha‘
“rrriiiidhouse” hioh clinic to hd‘
an integral part of the Grlnllcll
tradition. in those diiys tho

on playing the width of thc courtl
rather than the length. At that}
tune the rules specified that an
out of hounds nail went to who-
ever got it. Thus the cagcrs
often scrambled among the spec-
tators in order to recover a loose
hall.

A little after 1910 Jim Slum
compiled an individual scoring
record for his three years a!
competition which stands among
the three best in Ci-innell history.
At about the same time Harry
Hopkins, later to he the famous
right hand man of President,
Roosevelt held down a starting
post on the Pioneer five. Around

1920 Frcd Benz joined Sluiz as.

an all time high scorer.

During all of Truesdsle's reign
as Grinnell cage coach, the Pin
