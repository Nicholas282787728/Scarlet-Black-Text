THEl TESTING THEE

This week will test the temper of
the Grinnsllspirit. Two weeks ago
enthusiasm was at fsver pitch. The
student body to a man was loyal in
its support of the football team.

Ten days ago the team suffered a
decisive defeat For the last ten
days that team has been working with
undoubted determination for its nexl
gains, the Kilnsss Aggie contest on
Saturday.

Call the loyalty and support or
the student body meet defeat in Lha_

same spirit?
n‘sll spirit fades into a fair weather
enthusiasm that is drlvzn to cover by
the first indication of a rough sea. -
if it can, and we believe that i.
can, the game next Saturday should
be accompanied by the same interest
and loyalty that have marked the
earlier games on the Pioneer schedule.
It’s very easy when defeat come:

The Editor

The Scarlet and Black
Gl'lnnell College.

Every year at this time there oc<
curs on the college campus the Grins
nellaln»Chlua movement. This mova-
mcnt is the crystalization of the Grin—
nell ideal of service—a lofty ideal that
commands the admiration of every
mortal on earth.

I have the most profound respect
for this ideal and I have worked for
its realization. The Grinnell-in-
China chapel this year is parucularly
impressive because of its interpre-
tation of this ideal from a busi-
ness point of view. It is, of course,
hardly fair to blame a person who
see things strictly from the Nordic
viewpoint and does not take the
trouble ol looking into the Chinese
philosophy of life. But should an
ideal as such be interpreted from

I pray that the Gl‘innelHn-China

but I also pray that this method of
approach and appeal will not con-
tinue for the years that are yet to
be, For it, if it continues, will des—

in this college and be detrimental to

so proud.
