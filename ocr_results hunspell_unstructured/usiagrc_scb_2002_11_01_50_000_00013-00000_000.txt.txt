Harry Potter and the Inv'sible Fifth Book

is has been over rwe yeais sinee Hany Polm'tmd s/ir
Goo/er ofFizc, book number tour in she Rosier series by
J.K. Rowling. has been released so she public. Ifyou'rc nor
a Harry Posse. ran, slien l have iwo shings so sell you: DYou
should be, and 2)You have my permission so srop reading.
though if you do shen I'll never speak so you again. Did I
meniion than you should be a Harry Rosier fan?

I assume l have a small and elise loyal pack of
readers lers as shis poinr, so now shar i’ve weeded
our all she had eggs, I ran begin. Those oryou who
have read she foursh bookin she Rorser series know
shas is had a climianger endings ls was aggravar.
ingrhas she bookended in shis way. bus is
was also okay, beeanse readers had been
assured by Rowling's buukrarywr For-
mas shas Book rive souldn’r be see
far away

Well, as you and 1 found out, shis
was all a lie, and undoubredly a vasr
eonspiraey. Ms. Rowling is unquestionv
ably a horrible sadisr who delights in sorsuring ihe pre.
eious readers slias she mpsivared as she srarr or Book one.
Is shis really necessary? Don't we all endure enough sorsure
in our day-ro-day lives wishous having so deal wish she
abrups ssoppage otHarry’s escapades as Hogwarss?

The answer is yes we do, and l can see no other mosive
ror Ms, Rowling's refusal so ges wish she program shan so
cause gripping sersaie so her rruesr tans. she claims shis
she wanss so make sure she new book is perrees before is
