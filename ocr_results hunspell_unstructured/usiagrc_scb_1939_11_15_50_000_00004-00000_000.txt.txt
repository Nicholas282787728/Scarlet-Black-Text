against that ancient foe, hunger,
and that even more ancient foe,
finance, the Women's Honor "G”
momentarily departs from its
time~worn, variety-ragged slogan
of “Eat, drink and be merry,"

In the place of this ancienti
platitude. these noble women sub-
stitute a colossal idea—a hop
with no hopping, a hall with no
balling. In other words, their new-
found slogan is “Play, gypsies”
'withuut the gypsies, but plenty
of play.

Friday night. November 24,
will see games of chance, corn.
and not on the cob, all above
board or in the bucket, various
and taney varieties of refresh-
ments, but climhxing alpwe
dance to the tunes of Sam Parzyr
hok (we've got what you want)
and his Swihgmasters.

Under the direction of Cleo-
patra of yore, Master John
Yourd, the babes and buddies will
swing high and swoop low and
no truckin‘! A square deal. a
square dance and all in round
numbers.

Pressed for a quotation, Pres-
ident Frances Mott said, “Gentle-
men, take note. There will be a
stag line from here to the quad.
Of course, they can bring their
dates if they want to, but it less
expensive Dutch.” Imagine, in a

gypsy party, too.
