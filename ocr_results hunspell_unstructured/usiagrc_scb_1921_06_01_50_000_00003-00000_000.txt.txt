Clubs and Orchestra Play to
Large Audience.

Last night's rrei-ror-mancc or “Mill's
tlld" by members or the School of
Music faculty, glee cliihs and ol'clless
tl'il. Wits a. success from every Dolllt
or view, The leading parts were well
talren, the choruses etrectiie and the
orchestra, under- the direction or Prof.
G L, Pierce, gave a true accompani-
ment which added to the musical ex-
cellence ot the opera.

The part or Lady Harriet, or Martha,
was sung by Miss Jean Young Currie.
Her voice was especially suited to
this role because of its quality and
ciearness. She retained the apprecia—
tion or her audience from the rirst
scene until the end of the opera Hei-
singing or the raroiliar- solo "'Tis the
Last Rose of Summer” was especially
well received. .

Mr. Arthur Eaguy—Cote as PlunkeLl,
sang and acted with a freedom that
made his part a complete success. nis
song with the male chorus “Hurrah,
hurrah, {or English beel'“ has one 0!
the best parts of the entire program.
He shared honor-s as comedian with
Prat, David E. Peck who made a
splendid Sir Tristram and won much
applause tor the trio with Nancy and
Lady Harriet in the ﬁrst act.

Prof, Elias Blum in the part or
Lionel sang exceedingly well. The
Solo “None so Rare, None so Fair"
was especially good. His tenor part
in the quartets was noticeably tine.
Perhaps the best or these was the
Spinning Quartet. The voices were
well blended and the action carried
on in a manner that showed admirable
stage presence Though Mrs. Robert

Bouma's part as Nancy was less
prominent she took it very well and
did her best work in the duet with
Plunkett in the rinal scene. Prof. L.
D. Hanson made a realistic Shel‘if or
Richmond and olticiated at the fair in
a pompous manner.

"Martha“‘was given tor the beneﬁt
of the Endowment and was well re-
ceived by an appreciative audience.
