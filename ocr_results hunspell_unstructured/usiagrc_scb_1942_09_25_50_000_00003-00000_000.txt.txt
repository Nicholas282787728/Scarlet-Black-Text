Prep. Revives Gay Nineties;
Pedals 300 Miles To School

By Jack Monkey

James Doratliy, Grinncll prep, of
Read ball: San Juan, Pnerto
Rico: Yale University; Milwau-
kee, Wis... and other points
cast, has proven conclusively to
all the skeptics that the bicycle,
as a mode of transportation, is

here to stay.

It all started in Milwaukee,
where Jim had spent the sum~
mer. With a week's vacation be—
tween his summer job and the
beginning of the school year, he
decided to use muscle motivation
over the 300 miles that lay be~
tween him and higher education,
After filling his lungs and tires
with copius amounts of air, he
hit the straight and narrow.
Nature Kind

With a favorable wind, he made
seventyetwo miles the first day.
The dawn of the second day are
rived, and st‘ 9 o'clock Jim was
on his way. Again the elements
were in his favor; the second day
he made better than ninety miles.
In the late afternoon he entered
the outskirts of Prophetstown,
luinois, where he stayed with a
friend. Between Prophetstown
and Clinton. Iowa, he experienced
the only inclement weather on
the trip. A wayward London fog
surrounded him, but he pedaled
on undauntcd.

While in Clinton, where he spent
the Labor Day weekend, Jim pur-
chased a gear shift which en-
abled him to cover the next nine-
ty miles in a little over six and
a half hours, and the next day
he breezed through the last fifty
miles to Grinncll. The toughest
pedaling of the trip was exper-
ienced in this stretch. Jim ran
into a strong head wind between
Toma and the junction of high-
way six. And a wind‘from any
direction in Iowa's farmland isn’t
exactly eau de cologne.

Gear Helped

For the benefit of those who
might wish to duplicate this feat,
Jim offers a few statistics. The
bike on which he traveled is a
common chain store variety
balloonstlred model, size 28. All
the baggage he carried was a
couple of pairs of pants and a
tooth brush. With an actual four
and one half days on the road,
Jim averaged about ten miles
per hour without the gear. and
about fourteen miles thereafter.
He stated that he had no tire or-
mechanical trouble, and found

ent shortcomings, and I promise
you that everything which can
possibly be remedied will be.”
Food Not Available

Stevens said that lack of avail
able food, not a reduction in
funds for food purchase, was the
chief trouble.

“Last year, we operated at a
net loss of $6,000 in the food de—
partment; that is food served in
the quadrangle and dormitory
dining rooms cost $6,000 more
than the amount student fees pro-
vided. We are quite willing to
operate in a similar fashion this
year in order to procure the
highest quality foods, but we
simply have no guarantee of de-
livery on supplies we order."
mod Nutritious

“But we are trying our best,’

and so far all meals prepared in
the college kitchen have contain—
ed over the optimum of caloic
and nutritive value prescribed in
government recommendations." i

his average coke consumption to
be about four bottles per day.
Without a blister on his hands
or an aching muscle, Jim now
attends classes as often as his
schedule will permit.

5th Wennersfen—

Where Is He?

—Censorecl!

Whercabouts of Dwight L. Wen-
ncrsten, instructor in physics
here last year, is a “military
secret", according to Gra‘ht 0.
Gale, associate professor of the
department.

When questioned last
Gale said that it was known
Wennersten is now in training
school preparing for naval ser-
vice, and that no other details
of his work could be revealed.

Wennersten left Grinnell at the
close of last year. Among all
the Grinnellians who have enter-
ed the armed services, he is the
only one to date about whom
such precautions against pub-
licity have been taken.
