Commentary

From the Right Window Locked From Outside

I prefer nothing unless
it is the truth. ~Socrates

BY DAVID RUDEL

Acceptance?

I could be mistaken. but I always
got the idea that the Democratic

mentll was thinking about this earr
her and decided that something is
askew.

stand one thing- when I speak of
liberalism in general there are some
specific people I am not including 1
am considering liberal those move—
ments which constitute an unman—
dated intrusion of government. The
“liberal" ideas which I am not in—
cluding involve those attempting to
limit government, such as attempt-
ing to legalize drugs. repel govern—
ment’s banning of same—sex marriag—
es. legalize prostitution. etc. These
are all movements that 1 support as
they attempt to put government in
its proper place.

The reason I have a problem
with the concept of the Democratic
party as being the party of accep—
Lance is grounded in die basic tenets
of liberalism. For intrusion of gov—
ernment we must have two things: A
groups 1) DeCiding that America as

Deciding that be is so sure that lie is
right and the rest of America is wrong

date that its ci :cns act in a certain
manner.

Noiy, folks, rliis is simply not
oeeeptonee. It is overbearing atto-
gance. Let me handle the (Wt) gripes
I amsute many ofyou have with this
assessment: 1) don’t conservative
politicians do the same thing, and Z)
so are you defendingslavety (I think
you know how rliis one goes)7

First, let‘s take the simple one.
No, conservatives (at least libertarir
an conservatives) don't do the same
things. Here is the difference: liber—
als tell the government to tell the
people rbey have to do this or that,
and conservatives tell the govern-
ment that it is the one who must be
restricted.

Secondly. the whole second
point. No. my mode of thought would
not have allowed the institutional
discrimination of blacks (or anyone
else) to continue because any reduc—
tion in the rights of a citizen (suf—
frage.equalptotectionunderthelawi
etc.) would be patently against what
I am advocating.

Such a policy. one of govern-
mental minimalism. is devoid of in—
stitutional discrimination, both te»
verse and otherwise, making it is the
fairest ofall possibilities

From this thinking, and the re—
action of progressives to the idea of
limited government. I have come to
the conclusion that the progressive
movement is about as accepting as
the vocal population of Grinncll:
acceptance if you agree With them,
and the mature response of anony<
inous hate mail otherwise.

My year as editor of the Scarlet
or Black has, in gene tal, been a good
one, though attimes abitfrustrating

Good because of the many come
pliments I’ve received on the im«
ptovements in the qiioliry ofthe pa»
per over recent years. because of the
hard work and dedication of my
staff—to whom the compliments re—

ally belong. as they are responsible
for most of die tinisbed prodiirr, be.
cause l have personolly leorned a
great deal about a lot ofthings over
the course of the year.

Frustration arose. though, on
many an occasion Usually it was
because I, or my staff, was criticized
for decisions we made. or for the
qualityofoutwotk. I’ll be the first to
admit that we made our share of
mistakes—we are all of us human7
butmanyofthe morearticulatecom-
merits like ”the S&E sucks" left me
feeling ti little angry. The people
who made these comments have nev—
er worked for any of the student pill)—
lications, and most said they would
never consider it.

I would like tosee more students
put their money where their mouths
ore and get inyolyed ii-irli publicar

desire to see you try and do better
(well, maybe a little), but because
interest in publications has waned

happy rosee someone produce better
publications in the futtireAbut to do
that, more people need to get in.

group of people with different ideas
