Beatlemania hits?
this weekend

Ily_Nancy Carpenter

The squealing sub-adolescents
who worshipped the Beatles in the
Sixties have apparently grown up
and enrolled in Grinnell College,
I'm not a Beatlebaiter but it does
seem that there is nothing quite as
avid tor do I mean rabid?) as a
Beatle [an All you Beatiemaniacs
will be happy to see A Hard Day‘s
Night on this weekend's schedule.

The lilm is much more than a
showcase [or the singing group;
Andrew Sarrls went so far as to
call it “the Citircn Kane oi the
jukebox musicals." While pore
traying an average Beatle day, the
film cleverly deflate: TV, press
agents, the police, all hucksters,
and Her Majesty’s Government
Richard Lester directed im-
provisationally, oiten working with
a handheld camera, to get a “new
cinema" look Amazingly, the
studied spontaneity works and this
movte was a popular success even
with non-Beatie tans. Fifteen
classic Beatle songs are included
in this 1964 film

Robert Altman‘s films have also
proved‘pupular on this campus.
images is Altman's portrayal oi a
woman's schizophrenia. Suzannah
York won the Best Actress Anard
at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival
for her role of a_\voman who is
driven into a world oi fantasy by
the pressures of modern living.
The camera picks up on the
“images” of her madness-—
tinkiing wind chimes, slivers of
glass, windows, lenses, mirrors,
The macabre music of John
xlﬂlllams,combinesiiviui the high
contrast photography to‘ create an
atmosphere that inevitably moves
toward violence. Altman shows his
strengths as a technician in this
Hitchcock-like thriller, Although
the film received mixed reviews,
most of the Critics admired it on a
purely cinematic level,

The weekend’s third tilm is a
classrc comedy, directed by Ernst
Lubitsch, To Be Cir Not To Be.
Lubitsch was one oi early
Hollywood's greatest directors of
sophisticated comedy and “The
Lubitsch Touch" was a deft
combination olsensitivity, wit, and
innovative thought that charac
terized all of his films Greta
Garbo said of him, “he was the
only director out there. He was the
only great director I had in
Hollywood.”

The theme of To Be or Not To Be
is that'actors remain actors
although the world comes tumbling
down around them. The story is set.
against the Nazi bombing of
Warsaw. The fllm was unfairly
attacked by some as being a
callous subject to humor, even
though Lubitsch's affections are
clearly with the Polish. Carole
Lombard, the great commedienne,

,made her. last,screen appearance

in thismovie, And, believe itor not,
Jack Benny plays the romantic
lead.
