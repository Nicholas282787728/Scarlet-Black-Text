LET‘S KEEP COOL
We see by the papers that three loyalist warplanes bombed and

sunk the rebel battleship Espana off Bilooa yesterday. This in itself
would not concern us so much, but the news accounts state that an
attack was being made by the rebel destroyer Velasco on the British
freighter Knitsley when the bombers joined the fray. Judging by
former incidents of a like nature we feel uncomfortably sure that the
British foreign office will pretest strongly to the rebel general. We
hope they confine their action to a protest,

We could wish that ships of neutral nations would keep out of
the trouble zone. Every time that we hear of an incident such as
this we are forcefully reminded of the relatively unimportant incident
which set the spark tc'the tinder of the world war. Just so this
“unimportant" event might set all the nations of Europe at each
others throats, unless we, the people of the world, keep cool,

DON’T WORRY, SENIORS!

Each year at this time, thousands of college seniors throughout
the country are faced with the problem of what they will do when
they are graduated, Many of them are worried because jobs are
scarce. Will they be able to make a place for themselves and be-
come self-supporting, or must they continue to rely upon their par-
ents for a living?

William James presents a logical argument on this question in
his book “Habit." He says:

"Let no youth have any anxiety about the upshot of his educa-
tion whatever the line may be. If he keeps faithfully busy each
hour of the working day, he may safely leave the final result to
itself. He can with perfect certainty count on waking up some
fine morning, to find himself one of the competent ones of his generate
ticn, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out. Silently between
all the details of his business, the powers of judging in all that class
of matter will have built itself up within him as a possession that
will never pass away. Young people should know the truth in ad-
vance. The ignorance of it probably has engendered more discourage
ment and faintheartedness in youths embarked on arduous careers
than all others put together."

The author is right. If college students take each day as it
comes, do their best possible wor , they will find themselves, as
James wrote, “one of the competent ones" of their generation.

' - ‘ t t A
Audience Applauds First In erpre a

Amateur Performance
of Broadway Hit

Honors to seorle

Equally high honors for the eve-
ning should go to Jane Searle as
one of the young women whose
lives are ruined. In the ﬁrst act
Miss Searle seemed a little too
hard and unsympathetic, but her
characterization gained warmth
as the play went on, and her read—
'ing of the lines was uniformly
good.

Good too were Margaret Currier
as the grandmother of the little
girl, and Elmira Russell as the
second of the two young women.
Miss Currier was unwise in the
last act in assuming a stoop to
suggest the broken spirit which
was quite sufficiently brought out
by the lines themselves.

Plays “straight Part"

In the second act, however. her
work was admirable. Miss Rus—
sell is to be commended for play-

By CARL NIEDLEYER

The first amateur public per-,
‘formance of Lillian Hellman‘s rec
cent Broadway success, “The Chile
dren's Hour,” was presented last
night in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium by students of the de—
partment of drama to a large au-
dience that asked for curtain calls
to the unprecedentediy large num-
ber of three.

As is generally known, the
theme of the play is the tragedy
caused by a vicious child who
slanders two of her teachers. ob-
viously, the most important char-
actcr is the little girl, played last
night by Marian Davis, who de-
spite a certain rigidity, gave a

 

 

ing a “straight" part with quiet
conviction. She was not at her
best in the first act, which oddly
enough was the one that made
(cwcst demands upon her; but as
the demands of the plily increased,
her do ity to meet them appeared
to increase proportionately.

Elizabeth Clapp made the char--
acter cf the aunt as shrill and silr
ly as it was intended to be, al-
though hor interpretation Some—
times suggested the farcical a lite
tle too strongly.

A Serious Plny

Without wishing to make any
reflections upon “Spring Dance," a
delightful play well done, one note
ed with pleasure the soberuess
with which a group of students in-
terpreted a serious playvvhich they
could really get their teeth into
In remembering that comedy rec
quires a rare gift one often for-
gets that serious drama has its
requirements too. Mrs. Pryor and
Jane lngram, the directors of last
night’s performance, and the has
tors themselves showed enough
awareness of those requirements
to make one wish thc department
presented tragedy more often.

True, not all was perfect; occar
sional speeches sounded theatrical
instead of real; there were mo-
ments when the pace seemed a lit-
tle swift, and the conception of the
character of the grocery boy in
the last act was not fortunate.
But these were minor flaws in a
generally excellent performance.
Perhaps some day the drama
council, which controls the choice
of plays, remembering the audi-
ence's enthusiastic response to
“The Children's Holll' will let us
look at some other serious drama,
Ibsen perhaps or Shaw.
