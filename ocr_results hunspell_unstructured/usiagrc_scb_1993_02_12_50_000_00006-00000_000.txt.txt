Fearless reaches out to

tried to imagine what

Tammy Zywicki’s mur-

derer looked like, the first thing ihat

leapt to his mind was that it was a

man. When talking to people directly

after ihe tragedy, the pronoun used to

describe the killer was “he," without
exception.

Thcimporiance ofthis factis not

leader of the student group Fearless.
“Itshows tlierc’saprohlcm,atcnsion

Fearless was organized to make

mitices to address the problem of
gender-based violence against
women.

The Fearless Education Com

towards women before they turn into

will help people learn for themselves
instead of by preaching at ihem. The

Grinnell Volunteer
Fire Department
protects and serves
the community

By Dieter King

R most pcoplc, fire fighters

riding proudly on their bright red
fire trucks, thrilling and inspiring
eager young faces. Yet, while these
are probably the two most widely
held images offircfightcrs, thcrc ex-
isLs many more facets to this vital
and dangerous profession.

Typically, many fire depart-
ments rely almost exclusively on
volunteers to fill their ranks. Lo—
cally, the Grinncll Fire Department
is comprised of 22 volunteer and
four full time firefighters.

As firefighter Dave Thompson
explained, the four fullrtilnc

answering the 911 emergencies,
alerting the volunteers and respond-
ingtothecmcrgcncysituations,“As
part of our duty,“ siaicd Thompson
”from 4 pm. to 8 am. we all double
as dispatchers for the police departv
ment.”

Once an emergency call is re
ccivcd, a rapid chain ofcvcnts takes
place First, the location and nature
of the fire or accident is noted. Then
the on duty firefighter summons the
volunteers via three different meth-
ods,thc mostobvious ofwhichis the
car-splitting tone of the fire alarm.

In addition to the alarm, lhc
Volunteers are also summoned at
their homes by an automated tcler
pllone system that contains the per-
tincnt emergency information. Fir
nally, and perhaps most imporiantly
noted Thompson, cacli firefighter is
summoned by a pagcr.

“I then get in the fire truck and
drive to the scene of the emergency
and tile volunteers meet me Iherc,
carrying their gear with thorn,” said
Thompson. “It works really well,
we can respond to anywhere in town
in less than three minutes.”
