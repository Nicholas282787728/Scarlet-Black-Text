new, library and plans for the fine arts building and two
new men's halls as prime examples.

"Grinnell college is not, and
should not be, a self-contained
community," Bowen warned,
"It is part oi the larger society
oi our country and or our
world. It cannot be isolated
from the problems that exist
uutsldc." '

Bowen noted that "the Dos»
turc ot the United States tends
to bc detensire and protective.
Vtv scorn to laclt a sense or di-
rection to be Without positive
policies. We live in a so—
ciety that is uncertain, apprcs
hcnsive, and partially demor-
alized." These conditions he
said had "a nroiound eitect on
young people. They seek
the pcacc and quiet or a good
rob and oi a home and family
, . . . They scclc little adventure
. . . . They are interested in re

Howcvcr, anen continued,
, my eaperience with

arc in coinpctition tor the allege

Bowen added that this revo-

carries within it the possibils

What is going on today could

a special obligation toward this
