is arranging for a ride home from a designated driver. “Our
advice is don't get intoxicated in public," he
added, “but ifyou do, you need to get your
tail home."

For students who are arrested, a night in
jail can become a prolonged ordeal Upon be-
ing arrested, Niffenegger, due to lack ofspnce
for females in the Powcsllick countyJailwas
transported to Newton and kept for 12 hours,
“I requested multiple times to get a sobriety
test because I was not that drunk at the time
of my arrest," she said. "In reality, I was prob
ably sober enough to go by two or three in t morning." She
also said that she was denied necessary medication and mocked
by officcrs at both jails,

Mathetly maintains that arrested persons are only kept in
custody until they are sober. “We want to release people as soon
as possible," he said, “It's more labor fol us to keep them here,
but we took them in for a reason and we certainly aren’t going

to release them andjeopardize that safety."

As of now, little is being done to prevent
public intoxication arrests; Matherly mcnr
tioned the possibility of deferred judgments
but cited other efforts as “Costly" and “labor
intensive."

He also said that communication has
tween students and police is generally posit
tive. “[Block Party], we have increased ene
forcement,and1 tell the organizers,keep ‘em
contained, don't have them walking down~
town with beets, and by and large they‘re
very good at that." _

Reflecting on her experience, Niffenegget is still confused
by the policc’s actions regarding legal drinking. “1 don't under-
stand how preventing someone from [walking home] is going
to enhance the safety of the town of Glinnell," she said. “If
there is a better alternative, then both the college and the city
should be responsible for providing us with one."

Fogfast fundraising fails to inspire

Annual waltz fundraiser for charity falls short of expectations set last semester

BY PAUL CARLSON

Before going to the WintetWaltz last Saturday, hundreds of
Grinnell students gave up their dining hall meal to fund chari-
ties through FogfastThis year the annual event, in which two
charities selected by the SGA Services committee receive con—
tributions from students donating theii meal plans, received at
least 200 fewer donations than last spring. For charities where
every penny makes a significant difference, the
drop in donations is being felt hard.

Students participate in Fogfast each year ”ll'Sa win-Wm-w/‘n iiluallan,

really—save yourse/f and your
eal restaurant to the charities. Dining Services tummy from me dining hall”

Emily Reiersgaard'08,

by donating the-it walta night dining hall meal
or delegating 10 percent of their bill at a lo

donates around 82.40 for each donated meal
to split between the two charities sponsored.
Students Can also choose to make additional
donations.

This semester Fogfast raised money for
Asociacion SOLAC, a charity based in Peru that provides free
school lunches and math and reading tutoring, and the Grinnell
chapter ofMortar Board. Last spring Griimcll students raised
“around 52,000"th Fogfast from 800-1000 PrCatd donations,
said campus SOLAC leader Emily Rciersganrd '08. In coine
parison, only about 530 students donated their meal to Fogfast
this year, a loss oralmost 5500. she said,

SGA services Coordinator Kirby Rims-tad '08 was only
able to immediately confirm that ninnbers had dropped this

semester. “The only thing I know for sure is that there were
600-700 cards swiped,"she said. “Usually we get between 800-
1000."

For Reietsgaatd, this reduction in donations bodes poorly
for SOLAC, “In Peru, [the reduction in donations] equates to
roughly 3720," she said, “which is enough to feed the children
lunches for months, to fund the transportation of volunteer tu-
tors [or] to begin filling the recently Come
pleted library."

Ramstad suggested that the discrepancy
may be the result of firsteyears and trans
fer students who are not yet familiar with
Fogfast. “I assume spring would always be
higher,"she said.

A ﬁnal count is not yet available, since

SOLACleader donations from_restaurants have yet to be

collected. Still, Ramstad said that from P-

Card contributions alone Fogfast has raised
about 51400. She expects that once restaurant donations are
added the two groups should each receive over 51000.

Still, Rciersgaard said she hopes students will be more will-
ing to contribute in the future. “We hope that next semester
people will be much more willing to donate their meal and
support local businesses by going out to eat," she said. "it's a
win-win-win situation, really—save yourself and your tummy
from the dining hall for a night, support local businesses and
do it all for charity. "
