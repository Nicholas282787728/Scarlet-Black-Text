As expected, the Grinnell City
Council voted on Monday night to
pass the curfew ordinance which
prohibits most minors under 18
from being out alter ll pm

At its third reading, the or-
dinance was passed with neither
objections nor discussion, No
representatives of opposing [ac
tions were present at this meeting,
cven though some groups had
voiced objection to the ordinance
or questioned some of its points,

THE ordinancc's greatest im-
plications for Grinnell College
students under is concern the
hours in which students may stay
in town. Previously, students were
able to use their own discretion in
deciding how long they would stay
in town. Now, however, not only
will students have to abide by the
curfew but businesses that remain
open during the curfew hours will
be more thorough in their checking
of identification

One additional aspect of the
Curfew's eflcctiveness should be a
decrease in the amount of minors
in bars. Since the curfew will
necessitate these proprietors
checking ID’s, underage students
will be discouraged further from
patronizing drinking establish-

than others. These include music, '

economics, history, psychology,

Wiggins elaborated on specific
failures and areas of possible
assistance within the music,

ments. He pointed out that the

the areas of musical traditions.

AFTER Monday night’s
meeting, Police Chief Bill Peters
took the opportunity to warn
college students about the duration
of their stay in town bars and other
places of business that remain
open alter 11:00 p.m. Commented
Peters, “We'll stop and check
identiiication as many times as we
feel it is necessary. College
students have to have a little
consideration.”

Mayor Floyd Beaver expressed
the hope that the curfew will
reduce Vandalism. He does not
bcheve that college students are
generally responsible [or the
vandalism, however, and hopes
that he will have the cooperation of
students who are under 18, The
Mayor also added that “We didn't
pass this ordinance to put a hard-
ship on anybody who's a respon-
sible person."

CHIEF Peters again stated that
the general purpose of the ore
dinance is to hold down the in
creasing vandalism rate, “Un»
fortunately," he said, “some in-
nocent persons must suffer at the
hands of the wrongdoers." Peters
hopes that, eventually, a decrease
in teen-relatcd crimes, including
vandalism, will allow the citv

i council to reconsider the matter of

a curfew ordinance.
The ordinance stipulates that

COLLEGE President Richard
Turner expressed some concern
that some townspeople may use the
college as a gathering place in an
attempt to circumvent the or:

stated that the police force can and
will come onto campus in the event
of any trouble of this kind,

In a Written statement, Turner
urged college students subject to
the new ordinancc to obey the law.

”I ask minors in the student body
to consider that the law . is
the result of careful deliberations
by the City Council, which
has acted reluctantly in con-
sideration of the best interests of
the citizenry as a whole I ask all
College students to observe and
respect the law . . and to work,
each as she or he can, to improve
the life of all young Grinnellians, to
the end that the conditions which
have led to a distasteful ordinance
may be removed,” he said,
