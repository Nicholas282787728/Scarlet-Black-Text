The Harsh Realities
of Mortar Board

By Nadia AbdelAWahab

Let’s talk about myths and reali-
ties. There‘s a group on campus
which is exclusively for sman sen-
iors. All their events are secret and
exclusive. You don‘t do anything in
this exclusive group except sit and
eat and its only good point is that it
looks dynamite on a resume.

That was a myth Now let’s talk
about realities 7 Mortar Board rer

“We‘re not exclusive," said

dent. Granted. the actual member-
ship is limited to seniors who have
achieved a certain GPA, but the
group exists for the entire campus.

“Mortar Board does activities for
all the campus and the community,”
said Rab. The Zormember organiza-
tion,whichhasbeenoncampussince
1937. is planning to start two new
programs this year — the science
open house program and a lecture
series on women and politics iand
to continue some previous projects.

The open house is designed to get
Grinnell Middle School students
thinking about science and the pos
sibility oistudyingitin college. This
year the program is limited to local
middle schools, but Rab hopes that
next year the program may include
high school students and also be
expanded to include other disci-
plines. “We hope to make college
look like real fun." Rab said.

The “Women and Politics" lec-
ture series, being coordinated by
vice-president Mariah Goodc. is
designed to bring local and national
female politicians to campus for a
series of at leasteight lectures. Rather
than bunch all lectures ina brief Lime
span, the series will be spread out

over two months as to maintain a
high interest level.

Other projects Mortar Board is
sponsoring are Carryovers from last

hours at the local library. ”SLICK
should be starting very soon.” said
treasurer Chris Victor, who heads
the program. There are also the
weekly Wednesday Colfeehour lec-
tures at 4:15 in South Lounge. Cur—
rently the lectures are presentations
of Rosenfield grant recipients, dis-
cussing their varied summer intem-
ships. Coffeehour coordinator
Yvonne Anderson said that future
talks may include such topics as
abonion and poverty.

The group also visits two local
retirement homes in Grinnell on a
weekly basis. Eric Stevens. secrev
tary and coordinator of the Young
Friends of the Mayﬂower Home
program, said students participatein
a variety of events in the homes,
including helping with bin go games
and coffee hour, Mortar Board also
sponsors the organ-donor drive dur-
ing the blood drive each semester
and the Clean Sweep program, in
which students pick up litter along a
section of highway.

Now let’s talk

realities.

Although all these events are
coordinated by the executive coun-
cil, Rab stressed that Mortar Board
members were not just passive
members in a national honor soci-
etyr

“Membership means accepting
commitment," Rab said," you are
not just elected to put it on your
resume.” Rab said that underclass-
men “can work with the committees
if interested. and work on the proj-
ects" if they would like to become
involved. “I want people from fresh-
men on to be thinking about it," she
said.
