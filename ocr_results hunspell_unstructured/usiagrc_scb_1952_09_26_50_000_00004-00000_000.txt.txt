A familiar spectator at early
football practices was a balding
man in a brown suit. Dean of
Men Henry A. Brown has found
an office in the ad building “inter-

’But last June he found him-
self facing an executive desk
and the problems of the men of
Grinnell. While wrestling with
room and job assignments thlsi
summer, Brown studied Grin-

Brown who received his

is ma ried and has one daughter,
He rose from athletic director
to Dean of Men last spring,
when the former Dean, G. Lester
Duke, resigned to joint the Ram-
