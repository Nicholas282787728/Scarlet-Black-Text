Reparations: Today or Tomorrow?

After being unaware and oblivi—
ous for so long about the situation of
the African Diaspora I am happy to
say that I am now aware. And now,
because of comments such as those
from Joel Foreman about affirmative
action which he claims “helps mis
norities while discriminating against
white males" I feel that I need to
make others aware.

Europeans, in their cnlsade to con-
quer the world and its “primitive"
peoples, destroyed African people
and our once prosperous systems.
Now, today in place of most of the
traditional cultural beliefs and val-
ues, we Africans are living in
Euroccntric worlds that cannot sus-
tain and appreciate our customs . In

order for Africans to survive in this
Eumcentricworld,weareeitherfaced
with the ideaofassimilationorthalof
extinction: Thcrc seems to be no
middle ground.

Every day I sit in my classes and
all I hcar or cvcr read about is thc
European race as if this is the only
race that exists. Some Europeans
may deny that this cthnoccnu-ism
exists but what they mean to slate is
that the exislcncc of this cthnoccns
trlsm is so subtle so that it appears as
though it does not exist. When there
is oven discussion of minority races,
however, most Europeans start to
complain because these discussions
appear to be more obtrusive then their
discussions about the "generic" race.
I have found that even in classes that
are supposed to focus on multicultural
issues, they still deal with these is-
sues from a Eurocenu'ic perspective,
This is notsurprising becauseallthat
we know is based on how we have
been enculturated: all of ushave been
enculturated from a very
Eurocentercd perspective. The chal-
lenge I have to deal with as an AM
can woman is trying to find and thcn
redefine myself, and my people
throughanAfricanperspecuvewithin
this Eurocentric framework not be-
cause I want to, but because it is
inevitable that in the ﬁnal analysis,
this is thepoinlto which I will return.
The challenge is a difficult and drain—
ing one that I realize I have to deal
with on a daily basis. This is the
problem that European conquers have
left for African peoples throughout
the Diaspora to deal with. If we are
not rendered invisible, we see our-
selves from aEumpean point of view
and others see us from this perspec-
tive as well; we are always the Other.

How may times have I gene to
somcof my closet friends and lament
to them thatl can notundersland how
some people can be irrational in their
thinking The persons I attack arc
philosophers such as David Hume
and the renowned psychologist
Sigmund Freud. These two people,
and numerous others. have been the
founding fathers of the racial prob-
lems andcategorizations that we have
to deconstruct today. These men
were among those who claimed that
African peoples were "Savages" , very
different from they themselves. Yet,
in contradiction, these men tried m
apply their geneml laws and theories
to my people who they claimed were
different from them to begin with.
On some level I think we need to
question the authority of such men,
and the stages on which we place
them in academia because these are

the people who are responsible f
marginalizing African peoples

At this point I can hear Mr. For-
manandolherswhoshatehISper m
rive saying, "But I did not conqu
you." My response, "I did not ex
ence slavery. but now, I and m

out the world are dealing with
psychological, and economical rcpc
cussions of it." The reasons that] .
where I am has a lotto do with whe
you arc and what you are: this is th
reality of the situation. Idid not chos
to be taken from my homeland: I dj
not chose to be labeled and categ
rlzed based on physical characteril
tics; I did notchosc lobe at the helm
end of the economical scale.

Given that we did not decide

our European colonizers, and give
that when we arrived in these place
helped to construct (if notconsuucl r
the foundation of whatlhese places .
today, this is why there should be a
outcry, not only within the Africa
communities, but within theEumpca
communities as well for reparatlo
such as affirmative action to be giv-
not only to African Americans ,but
Africans throughout the Diaspora.

In the ﬁnal analysis Afn'cans wi
either get or take their reparation
