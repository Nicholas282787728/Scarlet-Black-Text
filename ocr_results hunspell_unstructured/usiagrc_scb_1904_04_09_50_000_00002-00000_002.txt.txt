JOHN P, WATSON.

Grinnell's Trainer the Great Factor in her
Continued Success in Athletic57Ml’.
Watson 5 Builder oi Strung Men.

It is with reason that Grinuell is
proud of the uniform standard of ex-
cellence which prevails in all branches
of athletics in the school. The thor-
oiighness or the training which the
college teams undergo has kept Grin-
nell ior years in the class of schools
with three times her attendance. It
would seem diliicult to lind all the
causes for the Gi-iniiell spiiit which
ﬁlls the college and animates every
athlete with the spirit of do or die.
Many things have contributed to the
spirit of harmony and unity which has
meant so uiueh for the success or ath-
letic teams. Faculty and students
have worked together tor the good ol'
the whole, and it results have not
come in the shape of constant victo-
toi-ies they have been seen in well
trained teams and hard fought con-
tests in which even opponents have
been obliged to testify to the lighting
spirit of Grinnell athletes. The teams

have not always won victories but
there can be success without victory.
In athletic contests one all important
element is preparation and in Grinr
nell’s contests her supporters have
never had reason to complain of the
condition oi her teams. No other
school sends out teams better prepared
to do battle, trained to the minute.
and Grinnell, with a lew exceptions,
has had to make her athletes, and in
this process of making athletes, the
famous trainer. Mr. Watson, has for
years been the standby of the school.
Who else can take toys and men who
have had no athletic experience and
oiten hare little athletic ability, and
make at them men lit to meet the
bestin the state? This Mr. Watson
has done, often times with amazing
results. From very meager material
teams have been made which would
have well represented a university.
“Jack's” success in making athletes
has won the absolute conﬁdence or
every Grinnell man who knows him
and has given him a well deserved
reputationas a trainer all over the
west. Long may he lend his services
to Grlnnell and make of her high
school boys, trained athletes and true
sportsmen.
