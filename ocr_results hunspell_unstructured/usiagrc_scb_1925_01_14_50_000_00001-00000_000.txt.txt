promise of being very well balanced
although lacking individual stars withi
the exception of Morgan Taylor,
\l’orlds Champion hul'dlcr.

The sprints are strengthened by
the addition of the incoming sopho-
mores as are the middle distances, cu.
though the loss of Mclll-ath and Porter
will be keenly felt. Gould is a. prom-
ising two year man, in the mile and
two mile. Gl'lnneli expects to Tie rep»
resented in the Drake carnival in the
distance relays, both four mile and two
mile

in the hurdles Taylor will doubtless
be a point gainer and Green is ex—
pected to run close to him in both
the high and low sticks. Taylor is al-
so a quarter mile.- of no mean ability,
and will doubtless be a candidate for
the mile relay team. Newlon is a short
distance man will also be wolung hard
for a. place on the mile and half-mile
relay teams.

Mmly Candidates Out

A number of candidates are avail.
able for the field events although none
are of exceptional ability. Rinefort
in the discuss and Meeter lo the shot-
put are perhaps the most promising.
Rinefol't is also trying out for the
sprints. Boettger, a good weight
man, will be missed as he did not re-
turn to school this ycar, The pole

NeO-Classicisln in England Between
1160 and 1700.”

The Modern Language Association
of America, which is made up or teachs
ers and leaders in the study of the mode
cl-ll languages, is a nation~wide organ-
lzltil'oll; and its annual convention is
something of an event. Columbia and
the University of Chicago alternate as
hosts to the delegation; and this year
Columbia entertained something like
eight hundred men and women of
prominence in the various modern Tan»
Silage ﬁelds.

Mr. George R. Coffman, formerly
professor of English in Grilluell, and
now in Boston University was secre—
toly or the Comparative Literature dis
vision, department I; and as such, read
before his department the report of the
committee on Medieval Latin.

Freshmen Defender] By :1 Score of 19-7
—-Ceili4-rs Shir

Skillfui team-work and long expe-
rience triumphed ovov spccd when the
junior girls’ basketball team defeated
the freshmen Monday by a score of
12-7. The veteran tenul, victor of one
tournament and runnersup in another,
was at an added advantage because of
thc loss of Captain Lynda, and Jenkins,
star forward of tile prep team.

Due to a slippery floor, the first
quarter resembled an acrobatic exhi-
bition more than a basketball game,
bllt each team. sank two baskets
within two minutes after the opening
whistle. Neither tcanl really found its
ieet for several minutes. Play was
inconsistent and roughuseveral fouls
being called.

Toward the end of the first half. ju-
nior team-work suddenly came into
evidence. The work of the entire team
was creditable, while the centers es-
pecially starred. The half ended with
a. score of (H in the juniors' favor.

During the second half, prep team.
work stiffened after extensive changes
in lineup, but the brilliant work of
junior centers and guards kept the
hall in the home territory and the
score heavily in the juniors' favor.

The preps were clearly outplayed in
the lost half, but their pep never failed.
Breeden and M. Jones, junior for-

nnd ended the game with the score at
124.

John Mnehlpiuc and Marguerite
Merryninn led a group in talking over
some of the social problems of Grin-

favored more informal parties and so-

those who do not dance. They also
suggested a more frequent use of the

es iol- entertaining. This group

met with Mr. and Mrs. Turner.

Miss Read spoke at Prayers last
Sunday morning, her subject being
"Pl-dyer”—wlmt it does mean and
what ii; can mean. Miss Read brought
out the idea that prayer is not only in
the unspoken word but in nature and
everything beautiful, which she lllus~
tratei‘l by reading a letter of Corot’s in
which he said that “his love of nature
was his prayer.”

Preceding Miss Reed’s talk Doris
Fessler played MaeDowell’s "F.0-

with Nevin's "Rosary.“

Pioneers “’orking Hard to Correct: De-
facts Shown in Missouri Game;
Lineup May he Slu'itm].

With one conference victory to their
credit, and a possibility of incensing,
then .500 percentage, the Pioneers
journey to Des Moines Friday where
they will make a determined attempt
to overcome tllc Drake jiu by taking
the Bulldog hcsket tassel-s lnto camp.

The done is in favor of the Pioneers,
both by virtue of Grinnell’s victory
over Missouri, and the fact that the
Pioneers Seared more points against
Kansas, the valley- champs than Drake
did. However, the Des Mo'iues school
seems to have a jinx oven, Grinnell
as was demonstrated last year when
with the odds in favor of the Scarlet
and Black, the Bulldogs twice nosed
out a. two-point victory.

Everett mid Ashby. Stars

The fact that the game in Des
Moiues Will be played on the large Col-
iseunl floor will handicap the Pioneers
a little, as it will be file first game
Coach Black's ilroteges will have to
play off the home court, which is con»
siderably smaller. Outside of one or
two stars, Drake is considered to have
one of the Weaker teams in the con—
ference. Everett at'forward, how-
ever.yis all outstanding scorer, and will
have to be watched closely, while Ash-
by at guard is lee mainsiay of the lie-
fense. Captain Sparks plays the
other guard, although he is not as
clever as Ashby, and Mont: is Eve-
rett's running mate. Vim Aiken, pivot
man of two years ago, holds olowll the
center position.

Chase shows Up Well

Coach Black is working his squad
hard this week, and is trying several
new combinations in no effort to find
a line up that will work more smooth—
ly thou the team did against Missouri.
Chase. the sophomore forward, who
was injected into the lineup late in-
the Tiger game Saturday, is giving a.
good account of himself in practice,
and it would not be at all unlikely that
he has earned the right to amt against
the Bulldogs.

Chase and Gelvin at forwards, Mor—
an at center, and Winter and Wing
at guards make up one combination,
while the alternate lineup consists of
Chase and Moran at fol-wards, Bose
at center. and Galvin and Wing at
guards, and either of these teams my
begin the game Friday.

E. C. Quigley of St. Marys ls slated
to referee.
