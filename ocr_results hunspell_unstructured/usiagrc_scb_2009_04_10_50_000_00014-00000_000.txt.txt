Mease, exhibited lier enormous directing tal-
ent in her recent rendition ofBertolt Brecht’s

awkwardly sized Roberts Theatei iilto a gland

mnnce came from Luke Saunderslllactiug 1s

Dear '

Request for Professor Leung

We are incredibly disappointed by the r ,
action of Dean I aull Smith and the Executive
Council 111 regards to out lcqucsl for the rcllll‘T
ing of Professor Mamvell Lcung for the 2009-
2010 Academic Year The Sociology SEPC
began its campaign to retain Professor Lcung
in the Fall and have since collected extensive
signatures from students in many drtl‘ercut
academic disciplines who have had the pin
lege orimcr ng with Professor Leurigiii the
classroom as wel in a number of collegce
sponsored activities.

The sociology SEPC sent 1 letter to Dean
Smith and members of the Executive Council
on February 8 with the hopes of beginning 1
dialogue around the importance of retaining
Professor Leung and on March 13 (over one
month nfrcr delivering thc letter) received a
briefemail in response,

Not only has Professor Leuiig proveii
himself to be 1 committed faculty member
by offering 1 wule may of provocative and
relevant courses (previously unavailable), but
Professor Leung l11s also assumed many po-
sirions of leadership 1nd support for students-
in the greater Grinnell community. His work
with Asian Students in Alliance (ASIA) and
students involved in Grinncll's many Qlccr
organizations, for example, is indicative of his
genuine commitment to issues ofsocialjusticc
and diversity.

The inadequacy nfrhc response from Dealt
smith on behalf of the Executive Council is
highlighted by the bruvtl’y of their response
as well as their choice to res oud more than a
month after receiving out in ial packeiiwhich
included a letter, over 150 signnrures on 1 pie-
tition, as well 1s testimonials from students,
Additionally, the oncepnragraph response does
not address any of the concerns voiced in our
initial letter.

While the Sociology Department boasts
the most minority students, queer students,
and women ofany department on cnmpus, this

(Q bl April 10 2009
Administrative incompetence abounds

introduced the idea ofinvcsting in local credit
unions r1ther than banks, which would greatly
enhance the economy right here in Giinucll
And our rrc1surer, David Clay, can't argue
that such investments are unsafe when large-
scale hanks have lost trillions in the past few
months.

While our investing remains tpiestiomble,
our administrators continue to falter. In an e
mail Seth Allen, dean of Admission and Fir
n1nci ll Aid, sent me while I was writing my
leb. 20 column on diversity, he pointed out
that nOl Posse Ali“ an Amcr‘ 1 students
comprised 4 72 percent ofrhc incoming class
in 2001 while they made up (o1sp., ) a gate
g1nniai1 4 97 percent of the 2008 lrcsliman‘

He then went on
to write: “so it does
appear that the Ad—
missions OlllCC has
made progress in
enrolling African
American snidcnts."
Simply put, this statement. along with Allen’s
notion ofiiprogress," is ludicrous

All of this llatkens back to out College
President, who bears the ultimate tespons'
biliry for these f1ilir1gs, something Professor
Ralph Savaresc rightly observed last fall at the
open forum, There, Osgood startled us when
he declared th1t up until that point he did not
know what on SA was. This is the some mail,
whose salary, coupled with Mr. Clay’s, would
cover the full in ion of more than two thirds
oi the domestic underrepresented minority
student in the glatluating class They could
lollow the lead ofthe piesident ofVVishington
state university and voluntarily take a majol

These beluwiois 1rc beyond incompetent,
they‘re InsulllIlgilnsultlng to our enllru come

it indicates 1 lack of 1ppicciation for student
input, but .ilso because Professoi Lcung‘s rice

encourage Dean smith and the 'ccutivc
council to reconvene and eugtigc critically
with oiu strongly supported 1ecpiest to retain
Professor M \1vell Leiiiig.

Concerned Grinnell community

No one is seriously arguing that any of us
who are actively engaged in improving our
community me doing so because we don't love
Grinncll. Although we have an 1mazing lnt
stinition that offers a level of opportunities,
freedoms, and support unseen at many peer
institut‘ous, no one is seriously arguing that
there isn't room for improvement and that cer-
tain problems need to be addressed.

The establishment of the No Limits Proj»
act to address these problems reﬂects how
much the student body cares about Grinnell,
We (on, however, that the discussion within
the community has encountered several prtfalls
and is in danger ofdcvolving to the point that
no progress can he made on any front, from
specific concerns tlint No Limits and other
groups have raised to the laiger issue oftiust
that l11s persisted so visibly since last semestctc

There seems to be an atmosphere ofcoinc
petitivencss that is causing lines to be diawn
where they will do nothing but divide the
student body Instead of lettinv tl lest: rifts get
deeper, all concerned students must engage

muniry. This is in part why more than 200 stu»
dents signed on to the studentrled No Lil-nits
Project (NLP),wl1ich calls for transparent and
responsible endowment spending as well as 1
number ofotlier measures, all ofwliich are rear
sollable given the thousands each of us shell
out to go hcrc.

Osgood responded to the project with 1
rambling letter that did not orfer 1 single resoe
lunch to any of the demands, resenrb g the
Republican House leaders that proposed an
alternative budget with 1 numbers. The most
l1ughable p1rt is 11' claim th1t“the College
hi1s workcd very hard and bee more sire ~csse
ftil in the 11st 11 years about hiring, tetai ing,
and promoting clivcisc faculty (and recruiting
and rctninuig diverse snrdcnis), which when
considering the 1ctual figures, is highly mis~
leading 1t ircsr

it's hard to take Osgood seriously when he
uses the economic Situation as an excuse to nee
rvlect the demailds,aftei he’s failed so miserably
in this regirrl (see above). The administration’s
ingenious plan of hoarding aw1y mone has
backﬁred once, and there 5 no reason to believe
it ll work this tiinc.

Not unlike Galileo, the NLP students
demonstrate the importance and practicality
ofa liberal arts education even when times are
tough; they embody cii nell’s values, which
laud critically engaged c ens. But our drar
ma cant end like Brechts. Once NLP leaders
leave, the next generation of Grinnells leads
ers must utilize theii education and make sure
their demands are met The burden is now on
the class of 2010, That having been sold, ac»
knowledgiug our investments and the clueless
ness of Osgood and Allen, letting this project
{all through would be the most colossal waste
ol'our tuition dollars,

those who disagree with them without make
ing it personal, seeming hostile, oi constantly
dwelling on what could have been handled bets
rer up until uow.\vc believe it is more pressing
to focus on how to move forward productively
with collengues who may not see eye-to eye
even on key points. At the end of thc do we
11 hive to work togethcrismdents faculty,

and 1113—1111 getting c1ught up in competi-
tion, pride, or antagonism for their own sake
is not only countcipioductivc, bur also scars
relationships within the communi

Anilin, we all love Grinnell, and it we as
individu1ls 11c hrwing this conversation it cer-
tainly means that we are concerned and have
the communiw's best interests in mind. These
two points are so impo1t1nt bcc1use they mean
we sh1rc common goals, and it's all too easy to
forget that. it is crucial to keep the eoi1vers1»
tron going, for only when involved p1rrres stop
talking will the larger discussion completely
break down and fail to accomplish anytluno,

Remember: take a deep breath and a step
back, and keep those pitfalls in mind.

Thanks for an act of kindness

The other day, i gave my daughter a my

being found on the Grinnell College campus.
Thank you for being so honest and taking it
to a place where she could be located! This

to instill in my children and will not soon be
