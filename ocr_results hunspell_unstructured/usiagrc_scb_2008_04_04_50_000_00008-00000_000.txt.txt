Get back to nature: listen to its call

April 4 2008

The first duke is always the most intense. Nature inevitably calls as you wander along a backwoods hiking trail. The urge is present, the neetl is immediate
You have to be careful to choose a blocking tree that is tar enough off the trail to protect you from potential sightings, but not tar enough oil that you end
up discovering the scary wildlife you had hoped to avoid With a tree in sight anti a sharp, sturdy slick in hand, you brave poison ivy, lizards, snakes and
arinatlillos in order to pop that ageold squat. Digging a hole Wlll'l the stick, you position yourseli’anrl yout pants so as to avoid any accidental spillage.
As you satisfy your primal uige, you get hack to nature, heeding its call once again. you are in touch With your body and nature in a very unique way...

Ilistcad ofliiding behind drawn curtains,
closed doors, and ﬂuorescent lighting, the
backpacker gazes into the open sky with the
sun glowing Warmly upon his or hei face.
A squatter feels the tickle of the glass, the
crunching of leaves under hiking boots, and
the wlloosh ofa soaring bird its a cool breeze

very desire to hdckpack alludes to a natural
attempt to reconnect with the ways ofoui- an-
cestots. As members of the iGeneration, we
tend to toiger where we came trom and how
we got here.

Instead of foraging for shoots and tubers,
we can shop for groceries oiiline. Everything
really is just a click away. but. when we return
to our roots, quite literally, the only click we
hear is the snapping ofa twig under our wane
daring soles. Mohandas K. Gandhi once said

that “to forget how to dig the earth and to
tend the soil is to torgct ourselves,"

The backpacker who digs a hole and
dukes in the wide open air has embarked on
none othei than the gieatest path or self-
discovery. What better way to reconnect with
ourselves than to reconnect With the caith
from whence we came? The authors of this
column opint that thc best way to get in
touch with our natural world and ourselves is
to give ii little otoiitsclves back to the earth.

Non-academic things to do in springtime
