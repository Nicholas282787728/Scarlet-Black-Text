Convention Continued

president. The final election will
be Conducted as usual.

Members of the Election Board
who approved the dropping of
the convention and the Chang»
ing of the secondary election
for this year were Kitten, Peggy
Gray, Mary Montague, Mickey
Wuestenberg, Dave Ferguson,
and Bob Holmes. Anne Patter-
son was not present.

Commenting on the dropping
of the convention. Kitten observ~
ed, "The action of the Election
Board docs not mean that the
tradition of having a conven-
tion should be abandoned.
When there are more than two
candidates there certainly should
be one.”

Reactions of the two candi-
dates toward having no con-
vention were similar,

Drake said, “I do think it is
too had that there haven’t been
more students interested in it.
One of the big things of the
student Council is the conven-
tion. But even without it the
students will have a chance to
see what is involved in a stu-
dent council convention. There
will be plenty of opportunity
with all the talks in halls and
round tables for the students to
ﬁnd out the issues and share
in the excitement of the cam-
paign.

Kassebaum declared, ”I think
it's a shame we're not having
one. The fact that there are not
enough candidates to make it
feésible is just one indication
of the apathetic attitude of stu-
dents toward student govem-
ment. To try and eliminate this
apathy is one of the main rea-
sons I am running."
