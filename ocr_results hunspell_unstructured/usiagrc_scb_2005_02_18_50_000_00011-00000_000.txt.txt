February 18 2005

it was a January afternoon in central Amsterdam
when my family happened to stumble upon the Royal
Palace. This is the sort of thing that tends to hap-
pcn in Europe; you’re walking along a normal street
ﬁlled grocery stores, restaurants and the occasional
Starbucks or McDonald’s, and then suddenly, there's
a palace! or a cathedrall Or some other building that
had already been turned into a museum by the time
Columbus set sail. (Of course, in Amsterdam, there’s
also the occasional scantily clad woman in gloweine
the-dark underwear, but that's

quite another story.)

The Palace appeared to be [Djresslng up like a Nazi may not be a
grealidca, but it’s nothing compared
to ting/e-handed/y screwing up

quite lively despite its age; a small
crowd of people was gathered at
the front gate, My family mshed
over to stare at whatever there was
to stare at, which appeared to he
a doorway behind the gator The
British man standing next to us
explained that Qieeii Beatrix of
the Netherlands would be appearing at any minute.
sure enough, a few moments later the Queen exited
the building, waved to the crowd, and took off in a
fancy cart I have to say, it was pretty exciting to see a
real live Queen right there before my eyes.

“Well,” said the British man, “She smiles a lot
more than my Qieen."

“Listen," said my mother, “You have willing to
complain about."

“True,” he acknowledged

And then I started to think. You know, for a nation
without a monarch, we Americans are pretty obsessed
with royalty I can think ofseveral Hollywood movies

the scarlet and black

Let's make Bush a monarch

in which the American-born lead character discovers
their royal heritage and heads back across the ocean to
rule some real or imagined European nation. And at
this very moment, I can guarantee that there are sev-
cral thousand yorrrig American women (and possibly
men as well) swooning over Prince William. (I'd like
to remind these people that things didn't turn out so
well last time someone married the Prince ofWales.)

Finally, I came to a realization. America needs to
formally institute its own monarchy, and George W.
Bush should be our first king

Now. you're probably cringing
in horror right now, and maybe
you’re thinking that too much
time in Amsterdam has permae
nently screwed up my brain cells.
However, I swear that’s not the
case; my brain is screwy enough
on its own that it doesn‘t need any
extra substances to help it along
I also swear that there's a method
to my madness, so hear me out before you dismiss my
idea entirely.

See, although monarchs used to wield real power,
things have changed in the past few hundred years.
Nowadays, so far as I can tell, the main duties ofyour
average royal are as follows: 1) Inheriting titles and
vast sums of money, 2) generating gossip and create
iiig scandals, a) owning dogs and 4) wearing elaborate
hats. Bush has already managed the inheritance part,
and many people would consider his dog the most
lovable member ofhis family. As for scandals,1 think
Dubya is already something ofan ovcrachicver in that
departmenri For example, dressing rip like a Nazi

may not he a great idea, but it’s nothing compared to
singlerhandedly screwing up the American economy,
foreign policy, educational system, environment and
reproductive rights in four short years. As for the
elaborate hats, well, I don’t know if Bush owns any,
but I am sure something could be arranged

Perhaps it’s because Britain and the Netherlands
are centuries older than America, that somewhere
along the line they realized: just because someone
makes a good figurehead doesn’t mean he or she will
demonstrate any political skill whatsoever. Voters who
rejected Kerry seemed to think that he was too ide—
alistic and elitist, and so they opted for Bush, the pi-
ousTexan whom they regarded as a more appropriate
representative ofthe American character. I personally
disagree with this assessment, preferring to think that
Grinnell isn’t the only place where Americans are in-
telligent and able to speak coherently. However, I'm
willing to be figuratively represented by a total bufe
foon if it means that I’ll actually be represented by
someone who realizes that allowing thousands of
senseless deaths to occur isn’t really consistent with
the idea of“moral values.”

So who's with me on this? Come on, we need to
act quickly! The Bushes need to be rclcgared ro royal
status now, before the leb ‘os campaign begins. And
if you have any lingering doubts about this plan, just
contemplate the following question: What was one of
the main factors that convinced the British to make
Monarch and actual political leader two separate jobs?
The answer is simple: years of being ruled by Mad
King George, Coincidence.> I think not.

Folly, adventure of apartment life

There’s a reason that the college only allows a ccr~
tain number or upper elassmeii the privilege of living
off-campus The world outside the SitthrParkrTenthr
East rectangular bubble is a largely unexplored, occa—
sionally dangerous, isolated frontier. It takes cunning,
determination and resourcefulness to survive in such an
environment.

The OCNCOer spends most her time away from
the physical and ideological security provided by Grin-
nell's campusTorn away from everything familiar, the
OCNCOer struggles to make a life for lierselfaniidsr
unstable conditions and unfamiliar people.

This week we will examine the challenges arid re-
wards ofoff-cnmpus quartersTlie hub oftheOCNCOr
er’s life is home, Your apartment is your castle. ,. sort of.
I mean, someone else owns it, technically, and could in
fact kick you out of your castle lfyou fail to pay your
rent. This person gets to impose laws on your castle-
laws like “no pets,m‘no smoking" and “no hot water."

Also, chances are you share the building (be it a
house, downtown storefront, or multi-purpose indus-
trial complex) with other tenants Just like in a dorm,
you must learn to coexist peacefully with your neigl'r
bots. These partners in the adventure of off—campus
living may in fact come from the world outside ofthe
eollege.They may have colicky babies or yappy dogs or
both.They may return home from their night shift in 6
arm. and start up the reggae, Or they may ask to borrow
something they call “baking soda."
