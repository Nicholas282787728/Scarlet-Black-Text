The Great Bliill Se mil.

Some morning at chapel period two
hundred gentlemen and tour preps
were given the high honor oi belong-
ing to the Chips club. Raucous
applause was rendered by the entire
audience—in the balccny. (They di —

n'i. know what was going on, an .

Above all these students are to be
congratulated ior something—prob
ably ior sending their parents here
iirst. To send them and be ableto
derive enough cash (what with the
elders having to pay tor eiicb meal in
advance and again when they eat) to
come themselves.

Not that i want to get personal. but
I don’t like the meals nor the waita
ers nor the headwaiter. And another
thingithe dishes aren't clean, and
the silverware isn't silver at all -and
breakfast is served too early and the
eggs are too hard or too soit. And
the parsimonious people who dish
the comestible are pet peeves at
mine.

Thank God for the Chips club,

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Would-be Doric Heads
Shovel Strong Colyum

An ungodly long and strong
Doric shovelled together by
such aspirants as are trying to
make themselves liable for
tiiese weekly spewing appears
in this issue at the SCARLET
AND BLACK. The strength and
length oi these sduibs has made
it necessary to abbreviate the
mizzen mast and reel in the
poop deck. (See Joan Lowell
for nautical terms.)

No evidences oi unity will be
noted in the colyum since the
eiiorts represent the hallucina-
iions of the individual (7) boy
wonders (with a few excepr
tions.) rather than the ideas or
the unassailable management.

Campus Opinion \' Chosen Thursday Morning

Question: Would you approve oi oc-
easional student chapel programs?

liclen Kingery: Yes, it they were
kept oi as high a quality as most
chapel programs. Then it would be-
come an honor to appear in chapel.
However, I doubt Whether it would
be a success as iar as drawing the
crowd.

Mary Limisuy: I should like very
much to have occasional student pro»
grams. They would be especially
line at the beginning oi the school
year. In this way the new students
would become iamiliar with the most
prominent men and Roman on the
campus. Some oi the students never
go to the student recitals and never
learn what iine musicians there arc
among us. I think that us would an.
precmtc some people more it we
could know what they are capable oi.

llonald Box. At present there is a
lack of interest in the chapcl pro-
grams and this will be more maniiesl
as spring comes on. The plans of the
iaculty to remedy this hare tailed. It
seems to me that tile best way to
rouse the interest or the students
would he to let them plan the chapel
programs or at least part oi the pro—
grams, ior attendance will come on.
ly through interest.

llcrtlm Nelsn - It the students telt
some responsibility in the chapel
programs they would also [eel smile
responsibility in attending chapel
since the success oi the program der
pends upon their attendance.

Margaret Yorii : i think it might
help to create a little interest in the
student body. i believe it could be
worked up satisiactorily. If they
would have special musical programs
it would help to arouse interest.

Dorothy Meade: I think we would
have a larger alendance at chapel
and students would would ieel more
interested it one oi their own group
would appear occasionally in a war
gram.

Aileen Cohen: Why not make stu-
dent recital numbers a part oi accuse
ionai student programs?

][ttil'ilr(l Pick: I think it is a good
idea.
