by Rob Sirloii

The KDIC auction, scheduled lor
tomorrow at 9 pm in Darby Gym,
has become a well-established
campus custom, says Kurt An-
derson, Station Manager.

“The auction has come to be a
Grinnell tradition," said Anderson.
”It follows along with the ‘James
Gang Bang.“Loose Hall Ball ' and
the ‘Grinnell Relays.’ " ‘

ALL PROCEEDS FROM the
auction go into the KDIC Capital
Equipment Fund, Anderson said,
Lastyear‘s auction drew $1,000 and
contributed greatly to the purchase
of a new master control board, he
said.

Anderson said that this year's
earnings Will go toward the
replacement oi old broadcast
equipment. “The auction hopes to
be as good as last year," said
Anderson

ALTIIDUGII SIMILAR auctions
have been a spring rite for the last
fifteen years, only since 1973 have
the proceeds gone to KDIC,
“Previously, the money went to
particular worthy causes such as
the Martin Luther King Fund,"
said Anderson

For the past fitteen years
Dick Sears, a prolessional auc-
tioneer living in Grinnell, has been
volunteering his services to this
affair. “Dick Sears is a fun part of
the auction." said Missy Bowen.
KDIC News Director. “He Works at
a continuous fast pace and tells all
sorts of jokes; he is a real pers
former.”

ANDERSON SAID that the
auction usually lasts two hours,
and that this Saturday night was
carefully planned so that no other
school event would conflict With
the auction.

 

The KDIC auction relies on the
donations of students, Iaculty,
local businesses, etc, “We will
auction oil anything so long as it is
in good taste,” said Bowen. ”Last
year we turned down an offer for
tifteen lninules of oral sex."

donations included such things as
backrubs, bowling lessons, erotic
sculptures, stolen basketballsi etc,

The most popular items are

Yugoslavia—center of diversity

by Dan alum

Dusko Doder, the Yugoslavsborn
assistant foreign editor of The
Washington Post. believes that a‘
Sovietinvasion of Yugoslavia
-iollowing Marshall Joseph Broz
Tito's death is unlikely.

He said, “I think that the
Russians would not attack
Yugoslavia. that there would be no
direct intervention. They are more
likely to try to use local conﬂicts,
particularly ethnic conﬂicts, and to
try to encourage sympathetic
elements in Yugoslavia to take
power."

Doder visited Grinnell on
Tuesday. He led a discussion on
sociological changes in
Yugoslavia. lectured on the
country's prospects after Tito, and
conducted a journalism workshop
on Wednesday morning.

Doder Said that internal
pressures ior lreedom may in
crease alter Tito’s deathi

“Tito has introduced some
lreedom in a series of halfs
measures. His heirs will not have
the charisma or reputation to
sustain the illusion that stability
exists under the present system.

 

But my leeling is that Yugoslavia
can neither return to the orthodox
communist system, nor can it
move to a western type of
democracy.”

Doder explains Yugoslavia's
post-war revision ol Marxist
doctrines as a calculated policy
designed to unify a backward,
multisethnic nation.

“You can find in Yugoslavia
anything from sex manuals to
Gothic novels, punk rock, and plain
junk, The leadels chose to call this
a Marxist system. but as C. L.
Salisburg at the New York Times
put it, ‘The dogma mighthave been
written by Groucho, not Karl.‘ "

Yugoslavia's nonsalignment has
contributed to its impressive post
war economic performance as well
as its political stability, he said,

“Tito looks at the US" as one
American ambassador put it, as a
cow. not a bull, all teats and no
horns," Doder said. “They've ex-
ploited their relationship with the
Soviet Union, gaining markets
without really compromising their
neutrality The present Soviet
ambassador in Belgrade once
described Soviet»Yugoslav

relations as

However, Yugoslavia's rapid
modernization has not been ob
tained without a measure of social
cost,

“A lot at women work, people
hold two jobs or moonlight, In that
situation, the family unit disin-
tegrates. They are copying super-
iicial American values, losing the
more humane and desirable
aspects of a backward society
They welcome traflic and pollution
because it makes Belgrade look
like New York. When you super-
impose western technological
culture. the conflict with
traditional values creates a void,
people are confused."

Cultural transformation has
been hastened by Yugoslavia’s
dependence on the western
economy, which in. itsell poses‘
potential social and economic
hazards. Doder said, “With a
depression in western Europe, the
market tor Yugoslav baby beef
would be shot. Yugoslavia is a
country with 12 percent unem-
ployment and 20 percent oi its
labor force working abroad, If that
20 percentreturned, there would be
so percent unemploymentea
revolutionary situation.”

Doder emigrated trom
Yugoslavia with his family at age
13. He spent his teens in St. Louis
M0,, where he later attended
Washington University. He 'pur-
sued graduate studies at Stanford
and Columbia universities. As a

served terms in Moscow and
