Romania and Reagan: dark times at the movies

4 Mont/ii, 3 Weeks,
and 2 Days (2007)

High production values
transform simple plot
into a masterful movie

4 MWIIIII. 3 Weeks, mid2 Days is a rcmotsr
less, unscntimental and gripping movie fol-
lowing the lives or two young women named
otilia Mihartcscu (Anamaria Marinca) and
Gabriela Dragut (Laura vasihu).

Dark in content and worldview, brilliantly
acted and ﬂawlessly executed, the movie can
be safely described as one of the best movies
of 2007 and certainly as on: of the bestsevcr
global exports of the Romanian lilm industry.

The ﬁlm is set in 1987, one ofthc last years
ofth: communist Ceauscscu regime.The plot
involves Gabriela getting pregnant and, with
the help of her friend Otilia. her subsequent
quest to procure an illegal abortion.

How the entire sequence of events pans
out, including the usual ingredients orlies, den
cert, blackmailing, ruminations on the value of
life and human relationships, make up the rest
of the movie.

I understand that the plot synopsis could
make rhc movie sound like ii rather runsofs
thermlll journey However, the movie is any-
thing but that. and the crew deserves ali the
credit.

At a crisp running time of 113 minutes
(short for a movie of this genre), the editor
seems to have earned his money The acting ls
truly first’mw. and the three main actors turn
in spectacular performances that most top
notch Hollywood stars are incapable of. The
overall effect of the movie, With its dark (one,
excellent camcrawork, long takes and nilruralv
istic dialogue, further adds to its appeal.

But the flawless direction ls what really cse
tablishcs the movie as great, not simply good.
There is not a splitesecond shot wasted. The
director (Christian Munglu) knows exncrly
what he wants to convey to his audience and
has elicited supcilauve performances from his
crew,

There are really no downsidcs to this move
ie, unless you are one of those people who can‘t
handle any movies that are not produced by
big Hollywood banners or are not in English
(the dialogue is in Romanian).

So, the gimmick here is that the Ritalin
Test Squad is going to be present at the ﬁlm
and say runny things Just like in that show

1 guess the big joke to make about the ﬁlm
is that later in life, the monkeyrbaiting pros
tagonist had power avet America's moral and

was impossible to bear for
an entire episode.
