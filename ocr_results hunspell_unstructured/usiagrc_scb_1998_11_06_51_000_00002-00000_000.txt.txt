Preliminary census
Work is set to begin

In the next few weeks, census work-
ers will be fanning outthroughout Iowa
to create a nationwide list of housing
units.

The next national census won’t oer
cur until 2000, but the U.S. Census
Bureau wants to make sure that each
household here and across the country
receives a Census 2000 questionnaire
That means identifying anywhere a
person lives or could live. ,

Address listers will begin recording
the locations and addresses of all liv-
ing quarters in mral and suburban ar-
eas that oﬁen don‘t have a city-style
address 7 a house number and street
name.

i-lere inPoweshiekCouiity, all home's
do have street designations, thanks to
the E~911 emergency reporting sys-
tem. But that’s not true of all parts of
the state and country.

The listers will be asking occupants
theirnames andmailing addresses, and
the interview is expected to take only a
minute or two for each household.

"The address list and related maps
are the foundation of a complete and
accurate census," said Henry Falacios,

who directs the Census Bureau’s re-
gional ofﬁce in Kansas City, Kan.
“Some ofthe people who were missed
in the 1990 census were missed be-
cause the Census Bureau dldn‘t know
their housing units existed."

The address list being developed for
the 2000 census will be maintained
during the years between censuses and
serve as a basis for samples drawn for
various surveys conducted by the fed
eral government. Because in some sur»
veys respondents are contacted by
phone, census workers also will col»
lect the telephone number for house-
holds wliere available.

Censusaddresslistcrswillbeidenti-
ﬁable by their red, white and blue
badges which say, “Census Enumera—
tor,"

All information given to a census
worker is conﬁdential by law and can't
be revealed to anyone who's not cove
ered by the same conﬁdentiality stat-
ute

Census results are used to determine
political representation and to distrib-
utebillionsofdollarsfromfederalpro-
grams each year.

Rotarians hear National Guard coordinator
' for drug interdiction activities

Drugs are a mayor cause for concern

in central iowa but the high proﬁle of

methamphetamine laboratories in the
past on days is. in large part, due to
awareness and education ofthe public,
Col Michael, Gardner, counterrdrug
coordinator for the Iowa National
Guard, told members of the Grinncll
Rotary Club at their meeting Monday,
Nov, 2.

Many more eyes and ears are look
ing and listening when the public is
involved than ifthe counter drug op
erations are left totally in the hands of
the relatively few law enforcement
personnel, Gardner added.

The National Guard is not a law
enforcement agency but rather serves
in a support role to the many law cil-
foiccment agencies. The guard has re
sources both in personnel and equip
merit which are invaluable aids to lo-
cal, state and federal agencies in their

continualeffortateonirollinganderadi—
eating drugs, drug trafﬁc and drug use.

The guard is involved in both or

mg with thc rratronal dnrg problem,
Gardnersaid. Dunngthe past summer,
some 600 Iowa sixth graders attended
DEFY, Drug Educational lot Youth, a
guard program which educated them
about the dangers of drug use and the

Estimates are that illegal drtlgs as an

Iowa has been stereotyped as a
nndwestem state in which drugs are
not a concern. The truth oftlrc matter
is that the Ia80/Ir35 corridors which
are primary transportation lanes for
the North American Free Trade

come major ihororrghiares for drug
trafﬁc.
