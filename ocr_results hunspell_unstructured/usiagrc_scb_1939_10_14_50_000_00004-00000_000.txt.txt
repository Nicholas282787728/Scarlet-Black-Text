Dihhle hall, by virtue of a decis-
ive 20 to o victory over Rawson
on MacEaclu-on field Thursday
afternoon, took top position in
the men's intramural touch root-
ball race, and also kept its goal
line uncrossed,

Jerry Fort, assisted now find
then by seven other Dibble play-
ers, was never in trouble as the
Eagles opened up in the first half
and coasted along on their lead
in the final periods.

Following Dibble, with but
scant hope of overtaking the
pace-setters, were Rawson, Clark,
Gates and Langan. Rawson, after
whipping- smith 21 to o, fell ae-
fore Dibble; Clark, after edging
out Gates 9 to s. was defeaterlby
iLangan 7 to o; and Gates, fol-
lowing a licking at the hands of
Clark, took Smith into camp 12
to o to enter the .500 class,

Langan came back from its 21
to o defeat at the hands of Dib-
ble to whip Clark 7 to 0; and
Smith retained a firm hold on
the basement after heing Sub-
merged twice, 21 to 6 by Raw«
son, and 12 to 0 by Gates.

Dear God, dear Mr. Weatherman,
and anyone else in authority i
please fix it up so that next sat-
urday will be a super-smooth day.
Make it a LOVELY day in Iowa
city (with apologies to the Na-
tional Farm and Home Hour and
its LOVELY days in Chicago)
hecause fourteen of Grinnell's
scrappicr gals are journeying
thither to accept the challenge of
the Univet 'ty of Iowa's female
hockey team, You've heard of
football widows. How about the
hockey widows? With madamoi-
sellcs Ci-uzen, Booz, Heinsen.
Hooper, Danforth, Teach, Carlson,
cotton, iCl'abb, Safris. kidd, Legs
er, and Weuscl (and incidentally
yours- truly) plus ahle chapcl'ones
Andersen, Mordy, and Marsh, the
ole campus should be temporarily
dead. Speaking of dead, the
Grinncll team has reams of
schemes worked out to massacre
the U team. our motto; Make
’em bite the dustt Our flower:
Dogtooth violet. our hope: Iowa
on the short end of the score.

Have you noticed the haggard
look on the faces of our Quad
sisters? Have you heard the re-
mark, “Well, I’ve never played it
before, but I‘ll try?” Have you
ever followed the gals to see
where they were going with their
looks and their remarks? Just

in case you haven't, they were
going down to pay their respects
to the shuffleboartl court which
is in the loggia just beyond Reed's
front door. Of course, shuffle-
board is a comparatively unknown
spoit to most people, out it is
gobs of fiili and extremely simple.
if you ever get stuck in e horing
moment or are out for a good
time, just drag your girl friends
or even your boy friend (if he
consents to stay in that female
habitat more than five minutes)
down the loggia to the court.
You’ll have a keen time. We
stake our best cue on It

Here goes the first reprimand of
the season. Where's that {ID-OI"

other words, why wal'en’t you out
for hockey practice? Haven't you
ever had the dcsire to play fool.-

the female sex was being like

nearest approach to football you
gals can have; so come on take
