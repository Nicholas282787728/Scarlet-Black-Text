Pleasure hits a high note

Last week I had a surreal musical cxperlr
ence. Even in grimy Gardner Lounge. The
Blow managed to create an otherworldly vibc.
Khricla was right on when she told me I was
“20, 000 [leagues] underneath rhe sea."

Where would this musical journey take
me? I thought about the purpose OfmuSIPKO
induce pleasure. Biit music isn’t just for the
ears. A Live show is
for the eyes too, and a
loud show may vihrnre
its way through your
stomach. It may also
be conducive to danv
ing. And with a name
Like The Blow, I have
to wonder: crm music elicit sexual pleasure.>

We hear about the uniﬁcation of sex and
music all the time. You might want to set the
mood with Barry White and a scented can—
dle. I’ve also heard that it's important to have
a pertccr playlist for your first time. In these
situations, music is an addition to an already
stunning experience. The music fortifres the
sexual connection, or even serves as a distrac-
tion when the silence is awkward. We leave it
to music to prit us “in the mood."

Some noteworthy gniitar twangs make ris
sigh. our scnsual side wakcs tip when we lisr
ten to someone’s fingers dancing on an instrur
merit The sexual imagery in many songs gets
us going.

If it’s all about the imr
agery, then the media seems
hell~bent on eliminating
musical foreplay, That
doesn't stop artists like Nclr
ly from producing charn‘r
el‘s, including “Pimp Juice."
Sometimes these songs disgust me, sometimes
they make mt: angry, but mostly they iust
amuse me To be honest, disease ridden male
ejaculate is not on in list ofaphrodisiacs. But
1 suppose the right not ofscxull imagery in
music could be a cut on, More outrageously,
perhaps music itselfcould elicit orgasm. 1n the
words of the Balenrlked Ladies, “ifl play the

Yes Well, rfyoure female, that is. A little
over a your ago, the company suki launched
OhMiBod, a vibrator that hooks up to your
iPod and convci-rs the rhythms and intensity
ofyour music into Vibrations. As Suki says on
their website, your mind and body “come" to-
gether to create an orgasmic experience. Apr

patently, rill you need
is a sweet plnylrct and
a closed door. At that
point, sexual imagery
may be superﬂuous.
The soundwaves, cons
verted into vibrations,
get you off. And that's
all music is, before it hits your cars: good vibrar
tions,

I wanted to get some testimony as to the
quality ofthose vibrations, sol called my friend
Jenny April in NYC and asked her about the
OhMiBod vibrator. Jenny told me that the
emotional connection to the miisrc adds to her
sexual experience, She has multiple orgasms
because with each song, with each lyric, she
moves to a new emotional state, which crer
ates i new orgasm. Her flowing feelings blend
together, forming a sexual experience truly
unique to a connection with music.

A song is the union of many people's efr
forts and inspirations in the foim ofa woik of

Dems razz Razavi’ s rhetoric

Last week Zach Razavi proved that like anyg oood debirer, he can make something wrong
look right.

He nrgnicd that students should not vote because they “do not live in town." Last time we
checked. students spend at minimum around eight or nine months out ofthc year in this come
mumty, many of us working in town and all of us paying sales taxes. Moreover, as long as we
Live in Cviiniiell, we live under its laivs.The decisions that our elected officials make dramatically
impact our lives The idea thit SGA “affects us more" than Iowa's government is absurd.

Do you think employers should be able to fire a or innell student for being gay> Do you think
working students and college employees should receive a decent wage.) Do you think‘ Grinnell
students should have the right to choose it faced with an unplanned pregnancy? Do you think
you should pay more for cigarettes at Kum and Go? Do you think the local police should arrest
studcnts who cross the street with halfrempty cans ofbecl?

Student government doesn’t get to nliswel those questions. No mirror how mnnystudenr inir
natives get passed, rflowa's government doesn’t ban discrimination based on sexual orientation,
students can be legally discriminated rrgainsrThis isn’t theoretical. In Iowa,elections are so close
that our votes can be the difference between discrimination and equal opportunity

Gtinnellians understand that student government doesn’t call all the shots. That’s why
Grinnellutns volunteer in electrons, pressure their representatives and vote in lows. That's why
Gilnnellians, in the words oer. Raznvl, “rally campus and community into a frenzy ofdiscusr
sion, action and agitation"whcn elections toll around.VVc know what is at stake.

Razavi claims that because most Grinnell students will not be buried here, we shouldn't
vote. He says that we are tinkering ivith a community thatw‘tll be here long after we move away
Fortunately, our founding timers recognized the nr'cd for frequent elections The decisions we
make only stand for so long.

As for Grinncllians' “general ignoi-ancc,"give us some credit. We like to thrnkthat Grinncllinns
are informed and worldly. Last November, candidates for state and local office visited out came
pus so many times that we couldn’t help bur know thc issucs. At any rate, ifstudcnts are poorly
informed, that doesn't mean they shouldn't vote It means theil should read the paper.

Our votes arc not an invasion of tllt. Grinnell Cominumh‘, but a sign that we are a part of the
community Thankfully, our government has recognized this fact too. Thats why we have the
right to vote.

Ignore ‘experience” and heed this word to the wise

Why Obama and other political greenhorns are more qualified for the presidency than Americans might think

Witching Barack Obama move effortlessly from question

alize that the senator from Illinois has talent. As Obama charms
voters with a unique mixture ofcharisma llnd political gravitas,
one wonders if there is any question he cannot field. But when

what exactly in Mr Ohnmas past
qualifies him to be president or the

the Washington press coips snrclls

in politics and governing is not nearly as important as some

When pundits vrulnt “cxpmlcnce,” they are actually group

knowledge and skill acquired through rimc spent doing pre-
vious jobs and activities; tnd “\vi

dour," the knowledge gained over a
long period of time from life and
from having been in many different

career politicians as presidents bcr

advisers and is informed by stare and Defense Department
experts. No previous job. no matter how irirpor 1n[, should
be expected to have adequately prepared an indi idual to be
president ofthc United States, and indeed, being president can
humblc the most qualified otpoliricians.The American people
must realize that, for any candidate (even a former first lady),
oirsthcrjobrtraiiring will be needed, regardless of the previous
experience the candidate possessed before raking office.

In fact, perhaps the greatest experience of all is having
watched the epic decline ofthc supposedly ”experienced” Bush
administration. Certainly, the president has shown candidates
how not to govern the nation. After seven years ofa stubborn

smile, “But he wouldn’t be running if he couldn't."

Indeed, what Mr. Obama is racing is nothing new to big
stage politics. Presidential campaign history is littered with rims
bitious candidates who learned how damaging it can be when
the press questions one’s credentials,and Obama recognizes the
danger offalllng into the “inexperienced" categoryThc polirir
cal consequences ofhav'ing been branded as such are severe, as
the American people have traditionally heeded the argument
that political novices might somehow misguide the nation and
make critical errors, which could have been avoided had the
novice had the proper knowledge.

But previous political experience does not necessarily trinsr
late into wise decisionvmaklng and effective leadership. As
Obama has aptly norcd, this has been the case {or the Bush
administration I) nming with "ExpclIBI'lCCdHEUShTAI advisers
and career pol m recycled from former Republican White
Houses (like Cheney and Riinisfeld), which has been one ofthc
most incpt and blundcring administrations ever. Presidcircies
like Bush's illustrate that Senator Obama is correct; experience

and expertise with occupational responsibility

But it should not necessarily be this way. Experience is too
often presented by the press and the people in absolutist terms,
represented as something that is essential foi avoiding “115’
takes and governing ettectively, Yet on the
contrary. wisdom and experience are merely
capable of assisting a leader, not guarantees
that the leader will make the right choice.

Agc can be a curse just as often as a
blessing. Those who have lived longer and
experienced more in life can teach all of us
marry valuable lessons about the past, biit it
would be foolish to believe that lessons from
former decades are always applicable [0 the
presan If we cxecssncly focus on the lessons of the past, we
can fail to see that the nuances of the present situation inru'
warrant a new solution that the “experienced" might not necesr
saiily be able to offer.

Expertise is foolishly ovcrcmphnsizcd in a presidential sy-

Iht Amer/tan peep/e have

White House, our nation needs an inspiring, charismatic and
intelligent president, not one who has spent the most time in
Washington or pandering to special interests.

I am by no means endorsing Senator Obama, who is ad
mittedly rather untested and green. Yet, it
is inexcusable for Americans to discount
Obama for this reason alone. Americans
need to realize that by creating a false di-
chotomy between the “experienced" and
the “lncxpci'icnced,” we are only preventing
ourselves from moving torward. “lnexperl-
ence" should not be a disqualifier. In short,
a broader deﬁnition of“readincss" is news
saiy. We should not be so obtuse to think
that experience alone prcvenrs catastrophe. All presidents, even
with legions otadvisors at their side, err even tually. The greatest
leaders are those who know when to change course and how to
learn from their mistakes. A word to the wise. give Mr. Obama

' chance.
