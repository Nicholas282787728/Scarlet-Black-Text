games of the season. All Grinnellmust

Any team that can heat Amos as de-
cisively as we beat her the other night
has great possibilities. In yesterday
morning's Des hioines Register we are
admitted as possible contenders tor the
Missouri Valley titlc.

“th STUFF."

Yesterday ive were reading the story
or President “'llsou’s great speech in
Boston, trom a Des lloines daily. When
we reached the bottom or the coluhmi
in the most interesting part or the
story, we came to these words, “Cori-
tinued on page four, column two.” We
turned to page four, but it was miss-
ing. only a ragged edge near the
stick remained to tell the tragic story.

We noticed a sheet of paper on the
tloor. Bending over and examining it
carciiiliy, we discovered that there lay
page tour, much trampled upon and
wrinkled, but still intact, except in one
place. You wmi That one place was
eolinnn two. someone had wanted the
story on the opposite side, for his
memory hook. perhaps, so out hadl
come his knitc, and haelt, hack, col-I
umn number two was gone.

lilci-e thoughtlessness has recently
been the cause or many incidents on
this nature, we are told, Papers have
been clipped, torn to pieces, or car-
ried entirely away from the library,l
thus destroying partially or completely
their reference value ior the iiitoie.,
It is on the newspapers in the read
in; room that all reiercncc dies are
dcpcndoni. it a paper is clipped or
destroyed, the tile must remain incom—
plete. This action, which is in reality
only ”kid stuff", has even been car-l
ried into the magazines on the second ;
tloor. It is no small wonder that the;
librarians should have become indig—
nant at this treatment or the l'eiidiugt
material.

Serious action may he taken it any,
one is apprehended in the act or des-
troy-iiig the papers, according to an
authul'ltdlive statement. The newspa—
pers are ours to leathgnot to carry

A MEMORIAL.

There is one duty which so far has
escaped the attention of the student
body at large. That duty is the pro-
viding or a fitting memorial in renlcms
brahcc of those Grinnellians who have
made the supreme sacriﬁce.

Ii the matter were brought to their
attention tlielc can be no doubt but
that the studcnts, iaculty, and alumni
would all healtlly support such a pros
ject. Neither is there any doubt that
we want a memorial to remind us and
future generations of students of the
reality at that intangible thing we call
the Grinnell spirit.

There will never be a more appro—
priate time than noiv to erect such a
memorial. The students and taculty
of the present know these men pers
sonally and nothing could be more ﬁt.-
ting than that they should erect it. in
fact it is a duty which we can not

‘iail to see and do not wish to avoid.

CHAPEL.

There are two chapel services held‘

in Griniiell at the samc time. One is
Lteld in Herrick Chapel tor both men
and' women, and the other is for men
only and is held in the Newspaper
Room between the Library and the
Alumni Recitation Hall.

The purpose of the service in Her-

riek Chapel is to set aside a few min»'

utes each day for devotion. tor appre-
ciation for better thoughts, good mu—
sic and literature, and for the develop
ment of personality. Mr. McGowan
told the men of the college recently
that success in this life, in a business

iway, depended largely upon person—

ality, and mentioned a. few of the
things which are offered in the Hers

‘ricli Chapel service as excellent things

to incorporate into one’s line in order
to develop personality.

The purpose of the second is to di -
cuss the latest scandal, to make a re
port of last night's adventure, to tell
“some” stories, and last but not least,
to iiatcli and embarrass those who

Wilass in review."

Take your choice, gentlemen, there

is no charge for admin on to either

”The doctiillc of The strong shall

“Our greatest thoughts collie from
God, and our greatest acts arc acts or

Mr Solicvc played one at hip own
