With a week of preparation and
rest, the Grinnell College women‘s
basketball team hopes to close the
gap on Monmouth. The Pioneers
host the Scots in a Midwest Confers
cncc matchup Saturday at 2:30.

After playing 11 games in 25
days, the Pioneers had a week to pre
pare for Motimouth. “We'll focus on
individual improvement which
should ultimately make us better as
a team,” explained Coach Jenny
Wood. “We scored only 17 points at
Monmouth so we are obviously fo-
cused on a better showing in Darby
Gym."

Last week on the road the Pior
neers fell to the top two teams ofthe

south division. Thursday Coe pre-
vailed, 8328, and Saturday Illinois
College won, 76-30.

“We were a little disappointed in
the outcome at Coe. They are a very
good team but we did not have ev-
eryone playing well. For us to
achieve success. we need to have at
least three or four players playing
well. Against Coe that did not hapr
pen, which is difﬁcult because they
have been a rival in the past," noted
Wood.

Mandi Hill ‘00 led the scoring
with nine points. Coe slowed her on
the boards, however, limiting her to
three rebounds. “Mandi relies on her
size for rebounds. In the college
game she’ll have to learn to check
out,” mentioned Wood.

bounds and scored six points. Sally
Goodspeed ‘98 tallied 13 points.
“There were a few more bright spots
against I.C. Both Mandi and Sally
got off at least 10 shots. We need
that to happen every night. We also
cut our turnovers down signifi-
cantly."

Coach Wood also had praise for
sophomore point guard Jocie Luglio
‘99. She has ﬁlled in for Kristen
Melby ‘99 over the last two weeks
and has gained confidence each
game. Having Luglio at point guard
may give Coach Wood the luxury of
playing Melby at the offguard where
she can get more shots.

“In a lot of ways I’m extremely
pleased with this team. Even though
we're going through a tough season,
no one has quit. People are still try-

Men’s b—ball returns home for
crucial conference game

Sports Information

A crucial home game awaits the
Grinnell College men’s basketball
team this week. Saturday the Pioa
neers host Monmouth at 12:30.

“I've said all season that the
home-court games are extremely imr
portant. If we can defend our turf in
the remaining three conference
games we have at home, we’ll remain
in contention for a playoff bid," comr

. merited the Grinnell coach, David
Arseneault.

With five games remaining in
Midwest Conference play. the rice
neers find themselves ﬁghting for a
shot in the four~leam league tournar
merit. Knox leads the south division
Willi a 641 record and Grinnell is sec-
ond at 574. Third place Monmouth
is 474 and Coe is still in the hunt at

4-5. Wednesday Coe plays at
Monmouth While the Pioneers hosl
Cornell,

“We are at a crossroads right now.
Against teams With a good point and
post combination, we’ve had some
trouble. Fortunately, Monmouth and
Cornell are solid in those positions
but not the top of the league. I like
our matchup against them," noted
Coach Arseneault.

Grinnell had a chance to secure
its hold on first place with a victory
against Coe last Saturday. The
Kohawks, who were in a must-win

situation, put up a strong defense of

their home court with a 121.97 vies
tory.

“It seemed like we were on our
heels all night. We had bad spacing
in our press and wedidn’tshoot well,
When we don‘t shoot well, it has
equated to a bad night all around, We

..

have to ﬁnd a Way to be successful
even if the shooting is poor," coma
merited Coach Arseneault.

Against Coe there were very few
bright spots for the Pioneers who
shot only 32% from the ﬁeld. Jeff
Clement ‘99 led the scoring with 19
points. He also collected three steals.
Seniors Clayton Kaneshiro and
Kevin Rennert scored 10 and 12
points respectively. In his top re-
bounding performance of the season,
James Decker ‘98 grabbed 10 boards.

”As bad as we‘ve played some-
times, the'team has been able to put
a loss behind it. Twice this season
we have had our backs against the
wall and needed a win. In both situ-
ations, against Lake Forest and St.
Norbert, we responded with great
efforts and won the games. i look
for us to show the same resilience this
week," concluded Coach Arseneault.

 

Mad Dogs fatigued but fired-
up for conference meet

BY ERIC RIENSCHE
sports Information

In the weeks ahead. the Grinnell
College men’s swim team will try to
find the mix of rest and training that
will allow them to make an impact
in the late—season meets. The pwr
Cess will begin this weekend at
Luther where the Mad Dogs will
compete against Loras and Luther.
a pair of tough opponents.

The weekend meet is a rematch
of last week's state meet where the
Pioneers ﬁnished third (341 points).
In that competition Grinnell finished
well behind state champion Luther
(478 points), but nipped at the heels
of Coe (395) and soundly defeated
Loras (238.5). “Some of our guys
are really tired right now and that is

reflected in their times," said Coach
Erin Hurley. “Buton the brightside,
some of them are swtmming better
than they have all season.“

Freshman Nathan Lueck,
one of the few sprinters who is not
suffering from the effects of fatigue.
came through in a big way at the state
meet. Lueck was the individual
champion in the 100 (50.76) while
attaining second in the 50 (22.89).
Senior Derek Fimmen backed up
Lueck's effort by earning ﬁrst in the
1M voluntary diving (153) and see
ond in the 1M optional (164.9).
Freshman Brian McElroy rounded
out the top ﬁnishers with third place
in the 200 fly (2: 15,44).

In addition to the high plaCr
ers. Coach Hurley also praised the

strong efforts shown by some other
swimmers. She singled out the sea»
son-best times of senior Brett Hendel
and freshman Aaron Severn.

“I was encouraged by the
meet because we finished much
closer to Coe than we had before,"
remarked Coach I-Iurley. “That con—
vergence could be crucial down the
road at the conference meet,"

The men‘s team has a rela-
lively small roster, so the slots are
already more or less ﬁlled for post-
season matchups. The Pioneers
could use a strong performance in
this meet in order to build up COIIflA
dence for the later meets. “I like the
matchup between our athletes and
Loras," said Hurley. “It should be
an interesting meet,"

Mad Ducks place second
Swimmers primed for post—season play

BY ERIC RIENSHCE

Sports Information

Going into Iowa’s meet for small
colleges, the Grinnell College
women‘s swim team's primary ob
jective was to learn, for if the Pio—
neers hope to excel in the all-impor—
tant postrseason meets, they need to
ﬁnd out which lineup is most effecr
tive, which techniques work best in
certain races, and
various other tech-
nical points of
swimming.

In the 1997 state
championship
meet, though, the
Pioneers were not
content to sit back
and use the meet as
a training exercise.
Instead, Grinnell
camc‘out aggres»
.sively, notched
some excellent
times in various
races. and received some gutsy in-
dividual performances. The result
was a strong second-place ﬁnish for
Grinnell (468 points). The Pioneers
ﬁnished just behind state champion
Luther (498) and well ahead of
third-place Coe (274). “Obviously
I am very pleased with evcrycnc's
performance," mentioned Coach
Erin Hurley. “Our people are finally
getting comfortable and are picking

up strategies to win races. A lot of '

good things came from the meet.”
Leading the charge for the
Pioneer cause was a group of expe-
rienced upperaclassmen as well as a
surprisingly effective contingent of
younger swimmers. Freshman Lisa
Haber], who has emerged as the
team‘s to I distance s neeialist, heads

lined the youth movement with a pair
ofimpressive victories. Haberl was
the individual champion in both the
1000 (1 1:40.65) and 200 breaststroke
(2:39.37). Haberl's fellow ﬁrst-year,
Sara Davis, also made a name for
herself by finishing third in the 200
freestyle (2:06.87).

Coach Hurley also cited the solid
effort of firstryeztr Kirsten Anderson

“Obviously I am very pleased with
everyone ’5 performance. Our

people are ﬁnally getting
comfortable and are picking up

stratagies to win races.’
-—Cnach Erin Hurley

in the 100 breaststroke and 100
freestyle. Finally, sophomore Jo
Schaalman dominated the 1M div»
ing, earning victories in both the vol-
untary (170.45 points) and optional
(162.5) rounds.

Veterans made their presence felt
as Well. Senior Natasha Vasey caps
lured an individual win in the 500
freestyle (5:34.95) while ﬁnishing a
strong third in the 200 fly (2:27.30).
Fellow senior Melanie Wyder
complemented Vasey. Her time
(2:24.57) in the 200 IM was good
enough for second place. Finally,
Junior Christina Ward and senior
Morgen Cheshire delivered a pow—
erful_one-two punch in the 200 back—
stroke, attaining second (2:19.94)
and third (220,90) res-ectively.

Ward and \Cheshirc have recorded
similar times in the backstroke
events all season, inspiring a friendly
intrasquad rivalry that has been ben-
eﬁcial to both swtmmers.

“Those two make each other
much better," says Coach Hurley,
“They are the best offtiends outside
the pool. In fact, they live together.
But when itcomes time to race, they
push each
other very
hard. They al-
ways seem to
have lanes as—
signed next to
one another, so
it is a lot offun
to watch them
race. As their
times indicate,
they almost al—
ways finish
close to
gether."

The Mad
Ducks are making ﬁnal preparations
for the postseason. The roster has
been whittled down because only a
few slots are available for the next
few competitions. The next few out-
ings will determine the lineups for
the upcoming Midwest Conference
meet: In the meantime, the Pioneers
will focus on a threeateam competir
tion this weekend against Loras and
Luther at Luther. “We Want to use
this meet to finalize our game plan,"
said Coach Hurley. The outcome of
the meet is not its important as the
process, but there is little doubt that
both Coach Hurley and her athletes
will be anxious to perform in the
rematch with Luther, who bested
them in the state meet.
