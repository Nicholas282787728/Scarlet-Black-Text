An Ideal Chapel Talk.
The chapel talk hy Walter Howe yes-
terday moniiug was of the sort which

the
Whether or not one agrees uirh his

average student appreciates.

'views, Mr. Howe is a pleasing speaker
and a cultured English gentleman, typ
ical or the better class or slugelolli,
and the tall: was a real pleasure. The
student body would appreciate an ef-
‘l‘ort on the part or those in authority
’to hring more such speakers here lol-

Friday chapel talks.

The College Council.

The College Council, maligned and
abused from its Very bil‘ih, would seem
to he on the eve of a reconstruction,
The criticism or it, which has been so
abundant recently, together with the
extraordinary power which was con-
fel'red upon it on Thursday cannot but
awaken the student body to demand,
in the very near future, that the Col
lege Council either he given such ad-
ditional features as will enable it to

that it he

justify its existence or

abandoned in favor of some other or
ganization hetter suited to the needs.

We helievc that the [armor of the
two alternatives offers the correct 507
lntion oi‘ the pichlcm and that the
College Council can he changed in such
a way as to give it the plestige among
the students which it must have to

justiiy its existence. We helieve that

lhees changes; a granting oi Addie

iional powers, a reduction in size, a
material increase in the proportion of
upperclass to ‘louer-t‘lass lepl'eselltttr
tiles and a plan whereby at least an
equal number or men with women he
assured, will give it the standmg with
the student body which will insure the
election of truly representative men
and women, a respect lor its decrees
and an interest in its workings such
as has not heen manifest in the past.

The plan (or an organization similar
to the Cal-dillnl Guild (\L Ames, while
it has certain undeniably good lcatures.
through its neglect at tile principle or
democracy and the tendency to hard
feeling which it would cr 'lto, i,- not
a Icasihie one. The other plans which
have heel-i proposcd are no more Dl'aCr
ticahle.

However. it may he solved, the dues-
tion is sure to he a live one in Grin
hell College during the next row weeks
and scarlet and lilack, a true at rtll
times, welcomes to its columns any
terse, sllotl opinion hearing on tho

suhjcc t.
