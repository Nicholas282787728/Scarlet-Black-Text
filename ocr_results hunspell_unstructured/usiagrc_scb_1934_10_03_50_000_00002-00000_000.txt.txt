ERECTING EYE-SORES

A very well justified dislike for the growing
custom of erecting; large wooden signs near the
groups of memorial trees on the campus was rce
cently expressed by a member of the faculty.

If the practice is continued, as classes and

:ampus organizations from time to time see fit
to commemorate this and that, it will not be long
until the paths of the campus will resemble minia-
ture highways, bordered with the customary bill—
boards.

The practice of establishing memorials for
loyal Grinnellians and that of creating class
memorials in the form of trees is by no means to
be condemned. Grinnell has long been famous
for its beautiful trees, and the permanence of
this reputation depends upon systematic replace—
ment of the trees which must be cut down from
time to time.

Neither is it undesirable that a plaque or sign
be erected which will explain for what reason the
trees were planted. The effect would he much
more pleasing, however, if the information could
be inscribed upon a small bronze marker which
would be less obtrusive than the signs used at
present.

A small plaque of this sort could be set in
a small block of cement or raised on small metal
posts at the base of the trees, and would add to
the attractiveness of the memorial instead of de~
tracting.

“KEEP OFF THE GRASS"

While on the subject of undesirable campus
habits, mention might be made of the increased
amount of ”jay-walking” across the lawn in front
of the book store entrance.

Since the college mail is being delivered at
the book store, traffic in and out of its entrance
has become very heavy~and a great part of it is
across the aforementioned strip of‘grass. It will
take but a very short time to wear an unsightly
path across the lawn, and the saving of steps will
be negligible.

The cement walk leading to the stairs of the
store was laid to save the lawn. By the use of
this walk and a couple of dozen more steps the
path will be unnecessary.

THE ROUGH ROAD’TO PEACE

Less than a month ago, Italy’s Minister of
War Benito Mussolini, mounted a war tank in an
Open field and proclaimed to the officers of the
Italian army his desire to promote and maintain
the peace of Europe and the world. A few min-
utes later in the same speech he shouted “We
must become a military nation, even a mi taris~
tic nation, even a warlike nation”. It is difficult
to understand which one of these two utterly in-
compatible statements Signor Mussolini would
have the world believe. Evidently the latter, for
last week the dictator announced a new plan for
universal military service under the slogan ”The
function of a citizen and a soldier are indivisible
in the Facist State”. Under the new program
each Italian youth will undergo military training
for twenty five years of his life.

Throughout the world there are many leaders
who, like Mussolini, who believe that militarism
is the best means for furthering the interests of
their respective countries. Hitler has filled the
air with pledges of peace, and yet he is working
to build one of the most powerful military ma:
chines in the world. Japan has time and again
declared hcr everlasting allegiance to peace and
yet her actions in China and Manchuria belie the
eloquent protestations of her statesmen.

All this hypocritical prating of peace can re-
sult in nothing but less of faith and increasing sus-
picions. Why profane peace by using it as a
transparent and ineffective vcil to hide warlike
actions? Because of this treacherous dcccption
practiced by almost every important nation of
the world, efforts to attain disarmament and true
peace have failed.

Good faith seems to be a nonexistent factor
in international relations ’today. How can any
progress be made toward world peace whcn the
very leaders of certain great powers proclaim

themselves by their actions to be believers in
m' tary force as the means of safeguarding and
promoting their national interests? The establish-
ment of fair and just relationships among nations
is the only sound means of preventing war. This
is a most difficult and complex proceeding be
cause of natural and inherent inequalities and
discrepancies. Mass movements for peace seek
simple but less effective ways. But now when
all other ways have apparently failed, the hard
and difficult road is the real one open.

I Other Opinions

WAR BEGINS AT EIGHT
(Daily Illini)

An eight—year old boy in Italy doesn’t have much of
a chance. He isn’t allowed to go fishing on Saturdays
or climb trees. No, the Italian boy must spend all his
available time learning the parts of a machine gun and
military tactics.

Miltary training is now, by order of Benito Mussolinl,
compulsory to all males between the ages of eight and
thirty—three.

The purpose of the training of young boys is "to give
buys a passion for military life thrugh frequent contacts
with the armed forces whose war—like glories and tra—
ditions will be invoked," said the Italian cabinet.

“Passion“ and “war" are hardly elements usually
thought of in connection with the melding of youth’s
character and personality. They are dangerous to boys
at the formative agt.

War may be inevitable in Europe. We do not dispute
that No man living has the power of prophecy to either
sanction or disprove when incoiprated in the education
of that inevitability. However, Mussolini is not clearing
away the clouds over Europe's future by training Italy’s
children to be blood—thirsty and sadistic ”heroes.”

Hand in hand with this new program goes the campaign
for more bahie Not necessarily better babiesAjust
more. Mussolii s slogan might well be “From cradle‘ to
battlefield. You raise ’em. We mow 'em down."

DRIVE 0N CRIMINALS CONTINUES
(Daily Trojan)

The arrest of Emma Hauptmaun for the extortion
froln Col. and Mrs. Charles Lindbergh is another mile—
stone in the work of government officials to track down
“big-time” criminals.

John Dillinger's death in a-Chicago alley was the
first news which reached the public of a determined
drive on the part of the federal government to track down
a man who had almost become a national hero because
of his success in eluding the police. He biundered at
last and went down in a hail of lead

The vigilance of a sewice station attendant who
watched ‘the numbers on paper currency for counterfeits
was the link which put authorities on the trail of the
German carpenter who held a large quantity of the
ransom money paid for the murdered Lindbergh baby.
Late developments of the case indicate that a speedy
investigation will disclose the entire solution of the
case.

Other members of the Dillinger gang have not fared
so well since the sensational news of their leader’s death
flashed from coast to coast. Homer Van Meter died before
federal machine guns in St. Paul. Charles Makley was
killed- and Harry Pierpont seriously wounded Saturday
when they attempted a jail break from the ohio State
penitentiary,

“Pretty Boy" Floyd and "Baby Face" Nelson are
now the two foremost gunmen at large, and perhaps the
only nationally notorious criminals,

lf Hauptmann’s arrest is the beginning of the end
of the Lindbergh ease, the blackest blotch will have been
wiped from the escutcheon of American law and order.

HIRAM STEPS our
(Daily Northwestern)

Under a new plan recently adopted by Hiram college,
the college year is divided into four quarters, each
quarter consxsting of nine weeks. The student studies
lust one subject during a quarter, or four subjects for
the entire year. After experimenting with the plan for
several summers, is success was so marked that the
faculty voted to put it into full Operation.

The advantages of this plan are obvious. The stu-
dent is forced to specialize in one subject for nine weeks;
he then takes his exam, and begins work in another
field. His attention is not scattered over a whole group
of studies, giving him only a superficial knowledge of
any one. Rather, he devotes his entire time for a short
period to one subject, makes a comprehensive study of
the field, and then selects anodaer subject.

Ideally, a student who is taking, say chemistry, could
work on Chemistry twenty—four hours a day. He could
eat, sleep, and drink Chemistry. He might work out
his formulas during his meals and take them with him
when he went to bed. Under these conditions, he would

truly have a thorough knowledge of the subject after the ‘

nine weeks.

At Northwestern, it is possible for a student to take
five, six. or seven courses at the same time. Even with
four, his energies are scattered and his attention can only
with difficulty be focusscd on any one subject.

Last year, there was some talk of revising the cui-rle
culum so that the ordinary student would study a few
courses at the same time, but with more frequent changes.
Perhaps the committee on curriculum revision could de.
rive a certain amount of inspiration from a study of the
Hiram experience.

Youth must not be afraid to face the fact that it
has to change politics, it has to changc business ethics,
it has to change the thcorics of economics and, above
everything else, it has to change its own weaknesses.—

Under our present form of education I am led to the
conclusion that, as individuals, Americans are great, but
collectively we are a fallure.~Dr. William J, Mayo.

 

The Book Nook

By TED KLEIN

In the college library is a section
known as the lows College Alcove
which contains a copy of practically
every book and pamphlet that has
been published by a Grinncll gradur
ate or faculty member. Feeling that
the returning aluuini will, with the
present student body, be interested in
the work of these Grinnellians, the
college library is tendering a cordial
invitation to anyone interested to look
over the collection at Homecoming
time.

By way of introduction to the au—
thors who make up this group there
IS here presented short sketches of
two of them who have published books
this fall.

There is no orinnell author more
familiar, at least to the men of the
school, than James Norman liall.
Ioumalist, war ace, vagabond traveler,
he has done the things every boy has
imagined himself as doing. Turning
his back upon a very promising career
in the United States and civilization
he has found happiness and the reali—
zation of youthful dreams in Tahiti.
His straight forward manner of narr—
ating his travel experiences has won
for him the admiration of all readers
who place truth above sensationalism.
He has just written “Shipwrecked,"
and with his collaborater, Charles
Nordhoff. “Pivcalrn’s Island."

No living author has more complete—
ly caught the spirit of this particular
locale than has Ruth Suck-3w, Daught-
er of a Congregational minister who
moved from parish to parish, she ac-
quired a thorough knowledge of the
life of her region from the smallest
rural village to the city of Des Moines.
Wisely using the things she knows
best as background for her novels and
short stories, she has gained an en-
viable reputation, along with Phil
Stung. as a teller of the lows story.
Her latest book, “The Folks," has just
come from the press.
