TREND OF WORLD AFFAIRS

(Frorii the American Friends Service Committee)

The United states delegation to the Disarmament
conference sailed from New York Jan. 20. When this
delegation reaches Geneva it will find a wonderful new
building just completed and awaiting conference Ses»
sions, The new building has sprung up almost by magic
as the date for the conference was not decided upon
until a, year ago and it was late in May before Geneva
was selected. Everything had to be thought of and done
postrhaste. Ground must be found, architects, builders,
materialieverything put in motion, Yet on Jan, 11
there was the opening ceremony, when the city and
canton of Geneva mode this gift and formally handed
it over to the Secretariat.

Foundations of the building are of reinforced cons
Crete, the walls are of sand, cement, and water plastered
on to a metal trellis. and are lined inside wrtb panels
of a special fibre guaranteed to keep out sound andl
damp, Heating is controlled by an electric switch. The}
pale gray color, inside and out, the amount of suiiorel
window space and the straight lines and angles (no
curves or decorations anywhere) make some people
think of an aquarium and some of a scientific laborac
toryt The building adjoins the Secretariat. with doors
leading from one to the other; its two large rooms facing
the lake wtli he used together with the well-known gls
room for the three major committees of land, sea and
air. other committee rooms open from the great vestir
bule and a press room,"of which one side is entirely
glass, gives on to plane trees which will loud and leaf
and lose their foliage long before the conference closes.

Fortyrfour telephone booths are provided, labelled

with names of many countries and or transmitting station ,

will broadcast each day to America.
A new road has been made and others enlarged.
The new road still awaits a worthy name, but at present,

is merely called the New Road. And perhaps that name’
may be symbolic of this great effort Ito persuade Lhe'

world from now on to travel a new road and to put
wars and weapons behind us forever.

'70 PER CENT EFFICIENCY
(From the Daily Knnsan)

a “c" grade is often apologized for by the remark.
“I‘m not going to school for grades, but for an educa-
tion. i didn't take that course to make a high grad
hut in order to learn something about the subject

Some students even fool themselves into bellevmg that,

one can make a low grade ill a course and know more
about it than an A student,

- The cases are few and far between in which an
individual really thinks nothing of grades but studies,
for an education. In those few instances, the student‘
who denounces grades for grades sake makes high
grades for by studying in order to learn, he necessarily
knows more than the student who crams before every
examination merely in order to impress the instructor.
An A grade is the mark of efficiency. B denotes a little
less efficiency. and so on down the line. By making
high grades-ln‘school, one shows that he is competent
to master the task set before him He will probably be
A-l in whatever he undertakes later. Sometimes, of
course. a brilliant strident is a failure in life, but not
often.

Out in the cold, cold world, 70 per cent efficiency
just will not he stood for. A bank teller who is not 100,
per cent 0. K. is soon numbered among the unemployedl
And he can’t. come back with the retort. ”I wasn’t. inl
that bank to make good. I just wantcd to see how those
money institutions are run,"

The student who takes courses and studies to in-:
crease his knowledgc will make high grades, but not'
because he is working primarily for a grade but becausei
of his efficiency will demand a high one. Those of us:
who do not like to study but who like to make high
grades, those who like to get something for nothing,
will have to find another excuse for our inefficiency.

English Instructors
Give Low Ranking
to Walter’s Chatter

“Mr. Wilielicll’s liluli little boy,
Vt’filter' might feel hurt it' he were
to discover his ranking in the eyes

‘of Grinnell collcgc's English depart-

ment. Though all the members have
heard of Winchell, none of them
bother to listen to his cllatteriztl-
though Paul Spencer Wood, head of
the department, admits finding the
Columnist‘s writings amusing. “BLIL
his voice over the radio is so Un'
pleasant that 1 never like to listen
Wood adds hurriedly.
The prize plum for nonchalance
goes to Harold s. Wilson. who says
he has never yet had the p liege of

listening to the blah king. Brit Will-

iam Mack, who has had that privilege
exclaims, "Horrors! 1 can't stand him.
1 never listen to him if I onn_help
itl" Both Eleanor Lowden and Sara
Sherman Pryor l‘CccCho this opinion,
but add that they find Winchell quite
unniipressivc.

Tile crowning- blow to Walter's
vanity is dealt by Grace Hunter, who
succintly summarizes the depot
ment's lack of enthusiasm with, “Per-
haps we're too high-brow.”
