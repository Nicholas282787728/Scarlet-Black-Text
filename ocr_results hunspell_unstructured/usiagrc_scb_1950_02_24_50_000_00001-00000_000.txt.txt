Henry Coweil. noted American
composer—pianist. and one of the
outstanding figures for two de»
cades in the service of contemp—
orary music, will be presented
in a recital March a at 3 p m..
in the high school auditorium.
Mr. Cuwell’s recital will be the
fourth event in the 1949-50 col.
loge concert series.

Truly an American composer,
Henry Cowell was bornrln Calife
:ornia and spent much of his
childhood among iiddling and
, ballad—singing relatives on farms
in Kansas, Iowa and Oklahoma;
thus he became acquainted at an
early age with the native music»
al idiom which has contributed
to his compositions a ruggedness
of form, a rhythmic vitality, and
directness of melodic warmth
that are characteristically Ainere
loan.
Has Played U. s. and Abroad
As pianist—composer Mr. Cow—
oll has played his own works
with major orchestras here and
abroad; as composer he has been
performed probably by every
orchestra in the States, and by
many abroad. Last season Serge
Koussevitzky and the Boston
symphony, having premiered his
fourth symphony earlier, gave
the “Hymn and Fuguing Tune,
No. 2," Leopold Stokowski and
the New York philharmonic—
symphony gave his “American
Pipers.” Hans Kindlcr and the
National symphony in Washing—
ton gave first hearing of his
Fifth Symphony.
