however, they have become more
than that. Alter the failure of bond
issues in 1969 and 1972, which were
to supply the iunds ior new school
iacilities, a heated contest last tail

on a bond issue for a new high
school polarized the community.

The bond issue again failed, but
the contest gave rise to demagogic
voices which have been heard at
every school board meeting since
last November, In an effort to
mobilize anti- houl board sens
timent, “selerighteous moralists"
(so characterized in a recent
hearing before the State Board of
Education by the School board’s
lawyer, F,W. Tomasek) accused
the school board, teachers, and
librarians of “contributing to the
delinquincy of minors” by making
available to students such “obs
scene" school library books as
“The Summer of ’42,” “Soul on
Ice," “The Godfather," “The
Grapes of Wrath," and “The

The attack on these books, and
on the present school board, has
been led by Ben See, a local lay
preacher, who after losing his case
heiore the County Superintendant
oi Schools last spring commented.
“I'm pretty certain we'll appeal.
But we've got several avenues
open to us. One is an appeal, and
another is a new school board this
fall ”

A new school board will be
elected on September 9, and See
and his conservative colleagues
have been organizing strenuously
to defeat present board members
Maynard Ratlety and_ Vernon
Graham. and to place in power
their own board.

polarized; the old junior high has
been closed on order of the State
Fire Marshall, split-shift
schedules {or high school students
have been created, While the
quality oi education has sullered.
In addition, many good teachers
have lelt the system over the
summer, many believing that the
petty squabbling oi the past year
has prevented any committment to
the needs of school children on the
part or the community More than
that, the local affair has blossomed
into an ideological conﬂict with
implications that go beyond the
local level.

in spite oi the ideological
aspects, the present school can
troversy is still concerned with the
matter of taxes In spite ormajor
increases in farm income in the
last iew years, many rural voters
in the school district still feel that
property taxes are too high and
they oppose further bond issues (or
that reason. However. educational
costs in Iowa in the last few years
have been increasingly funded by
state sales and income taxes.
These affect everyone, including
college students. Still, it is true that
bond issues have to be funded out
oi local property taxes.

There is another bond issue on
the September 9 ballot, and it
probably does nothave a very good
chance at success. What appears
crucial in the election of Seps
tcmber 5) is the composition of the
ncxt school board. It See‘s can-
didates Win, the odds are that the
present school crisis will deepen,
with further erosion ol teacher
morale, continued split shitting,
and a weakening of the Grinnell
school system,

These matters affect the college
in various direct and indirect
ways: practice teachers will run
into difﬁculties. faculty members
with children are becoming ins
creasingly concerned and the‘
problem oi attracting new faculty
to a town like Gl'innell will in-
crease,

Whether all this will lead to in»
creased iaculty and student par»
ticipation in local affairs is un-
certain. But, as in the case at the
city council's projected Curlew
law, it is clear that students are
involved in local affairs whether
they like it. or not. Several mem-
bers of the council have suggested
a general curiew tor the entire
city, a measure they feel is
necessary to deal with
distrubances in the downtown.

Students are airected by local
politics and, as a result, should ieel
tree to exercise our right to vole in
Grinnell.
