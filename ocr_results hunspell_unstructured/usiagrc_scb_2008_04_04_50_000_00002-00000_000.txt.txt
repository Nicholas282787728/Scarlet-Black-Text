Cleveland Hall mice raise tensions

isv ANGELA CAO

At the end of November, residents on the third ﬂoor of
Cleveland Hall sported a mouse. Since then sightings havc been
reported in the pit and on the fits and second floors, For weeks,
residents complained about the mice but to no effect as commu-
nication problems srymicd efforts to resolve the problem Since
then. lilies ofcommunicarion of opened up and there have been
no new reports ot‘mice sightings in thc hall.

After numerous sightings, Cleveland residents sent Cen‘iails
to Dean of Student Life Jennifer Krohn and
Facilities Management. Margie Scribner’io,
an SA in Cleveland (also an editor for the
sods), sent two e-mails to Krohn regard-
ing the mouse infestation. Mice sightings
persisted, and student frustration began to
mount.

At rhc end of February after four sepa
rate mice sightings in one night. Scribner
sent another email to Krohri. “After two
months with mice," Scribner said, ‘_‘I was
concerned that the college wasn’t iesponding to our problem.”
Scribner said she was then redirected to FM, which ptovided
mousetraps to students that had sent complaint emails to their
SAs or Krohn.

on February 26, there was a Cleveland Hall meeting id»
dressing the issue andjan Koszcwskl '08, Vice President ofSrur
dent Affairs, and Jamalaiid Senator Harsha Sekar '09 met With
Cleveland students on Mar. 3, Krolin has arranged for an exV
termination company to regularly be in the dorms on the third
Wednesday of each month.

Jones and Scribner also learned that Housing had actually
contacted an exteiniinator who set up 50 [mp5 in the kitchen
and halls ofClcvcland.The traps were checked over the course of
three days, but no mice were caughtr FM has continued to check
.the traps. FM and the extermination company could not utilize
any poison because orsarcry concerns.

the period or inaction was very frustrating, “Now that I know
what Jeri Krohu and Housing have done. I’m less angry, butyou
have to realize that feeling like we were being ignored and that
nothing was being done for months doesn’t just go away, espe-
cially for the students who almost on a daily basis had to live with
mlcc,"said Joncs.

For some students this frustration became too much to bear,
On February 25th, Krohn received a dead mouse in a heart-
shaped box signed by the “students of Cleveland Hall." Not all
residents of Cleveland thought the box was
appropriate though.

“I don‘t know who did it, and I agree that

it was not the most mature or productive m,
sponso,"]oncssaid.”Howchr,Ictm understand,
it’you were living in an environment where you
see the mice crawl out of your heater vents. eat
you food, defecarc in your bed and dishes, and
are possibly in your bed while you're sleeping,
why someone might be so inclined to respond
in such a way."
What seems like a simple case of rodent infestation
was indicative ofa deeper problem concerning the communi~
cation between students and the administration. one problem
Krohrr cited was the lack of specificity in student complaints.
“People would send emails that said,‘theie’s a mouse here’ with-
out giving any specific information on where in the dorm. And
that they had trouble dealing with [the mouse]," said Krohn.

Sometimes the lines of communication broke down come
pletely. “We found out that students have been using the FM

- website but it hasn't been working," said Les Ollinger, associate

director or Facilities Management. “We're hoping that if stur
de'nts have problems. they call FM office instead and we'll take
care of it.”

ITS has fired the email link and FM now is receiving emails
from their website, according to Kiohn. She also said that no
action against the mice took place over spiing break and unless
they get any more iepoits about mice, they Vl'll.l assume that the
mice are no longer a problem in Cleveland.

 

that while she was the relieved by recent administration action,
