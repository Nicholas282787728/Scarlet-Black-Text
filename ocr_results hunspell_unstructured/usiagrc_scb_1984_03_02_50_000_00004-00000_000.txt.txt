Social Intercourse:
aforgotten art

By Catherine E. ingrassia

For a lot of people. iinding so-
meone to talk to is a lot harder
than iinding someone to sleep
with: one requires a semblance oi
communication; the other, oiten,
does not,

Talking, chatting, oral coma
munication seems to be a swiitly
fading art. In this age of multi»
media-computerizedrinega-
communications, the simple joy oi
converstation has been lost.

or course, it could be predicted
easily enough.

Children sit in front of the televi-
sion being programmed to sing
along with Big Bird or Kermit or
some other anthropomorhic
figure. They learn to recite. not
react; to copy. not create; to imr
itate, not imagine. The act oi con-
versing gets replaced by the
passive observing oi iigures on a
screen. a screen that separates
the individual from their families
and creates an unhealthy sense oi
isolation.

Families all too often torn
asunder by divorce. distaste or
pure disinterest produce a pro-
ponderence oi latchkey children
without a sense of homeliEe,
without the simple pleasure at be»
ing listened to.

The simplest things like eating
dinner as a iamily every nightcan
make the diflerence between a
child comiortably sharing ex-
periences and words with people,
and a child whose senses are dull-
ed by lack oi human stimulation.
That daily tradition of sharing
your experiences with someone,
and more importantly, listening to
someone else’s, provide an in
dividual with a sense of communi-
ty and a context in which to work.

College seems to be the prime
spot tor this sense oi community
and art of conversation to
develop, but such is not always the
case. In tact. the sense oi isolation
can be much more acute.

Between academic, social and
proiessional competition. the in-
dividual gets swallowed. unable to
see beyond the binder of the book.
The prime hours are spent in purr
suit or academic glory while those
occasional study breaks are otten
devoted to a summary of the
latest episode of “All My
Children” or the interminable
‘I’m more’miserable than you’ la-
ment. Further the absence of cur-
ricular cohesiveness on the cams
pus as a whole often makes it dif~
ficult for one to strike up an ‘in-
tellectual' conversation with so-
meone, since the common core is

Just not there.

This is not to say that people
shouldn’t just sit around and chat
about nothing or that it is
necessary to have a ‘meaningful'
conversation everytime you say
hello to someone. Such an
assumption would be absurd. But
when this level o[ conversation
becomes accepted as the norm.
the lack of true communication
becomes more apparent.

Admittedly it’s easier to just
make idle chltchat, concealing or
ignoring anyming else that might
be going on inside; but ultimately
it’s more diiiicult. it raised in the
current streamlined, uncomr
municative iashion, an individual
will be unable to break out at this
mode, and in iact will oiten
perpetuate his problem.

In many ways ltseems pointless
to discuss such a problem 0b-
viously no possibility exism tor
restoring the time when a greater
commonality and sense or com»
munity existed, producing a time
oi greater intimacy and personal
communications. The fragmenta-
tion within society and the
microcosm oi society. the family.
cannot be repaired just with
wishiul thinking. The thought that
maybe such a sense ot community
can be temporarily recreated oi
course exists (“Hope springs eters
rial..." and all that goodstutt), un-
rounded.

But in the meantime, the chit-
chat and the senseless drone of
conversation that leads nowhere
will continue. perpetuating itseli.
The easier it becomes to make
idle conversation the harder it
becomes to do anything else.

The priorities

of alcohol ,

By John soarbaro

There is presently a bill before
the US. Congress to institute a na»
tionwide legal drinking age or 21.
The motivations behind the pros
posal are twoiold: first, to stop
youth irom traveling across state
lines in search of alcohol, and se
cond, to lower the number of trial-
tic fatalities on our nation's
highways.

The need for a nationwide drink-
lng age is long overdue. but place
ing the age at 21 is rather ar»
bitrary: 18 would be more than
adequate. Citing the Presidential
Commission on Drunk Driving,
proponents oi the bill tell is
critics that 42 percent at all fatal
alcohol—related accidents are
caused by drivers between the
ages oi is and 24, even though this
age group makes up only 20 per
cent oi licensed drivers. Having
an age limit of 2i, proponents
argue, would eliminate a large
percentage oi potentially drunk
drivers irom this age group,

What the proponents oi the bill
tail to explain is just exactly how
the is and 17 yearold drivers get
the alcohol, This age group is not
legal in any or the 50 states, and
yet they seem to aquire alcohol as
easily as their legal counterparts.
The regrettable truth is. as any
high school ireshmen can attest
to, that alcohol is accessible to
almost any age group. The old
cliche holds trueiwhere there is a
will. there is a way,

In addition to the enforcement
problem, this bill appears to be at
odds With other legal limits, Con-

forget the armed set-Vice

lot this country at 13. The r
quired ages for all oi these respo
sibilities are related to maturit
yet it seems that a drinking age ,
21 gave an undue amount
respect to alcohol.

The time has come for Ameri
to stop trying to “legislate awa

No matter how altruistic t

A question of

judgement

By Daniel Klatz

The position of Director of the
Forum is at best a peripheral ad~
ministrative job, The forum is
clearly a vital part oi Grinnell,
and good management of the
forum should be an objective of
the college, but one has to wonder
why a seperatc individual is
necessary to do the task.

Last year, second semester, the
director of the forum was on leave
of absence and two R.A.s filled in
and did a very good job. I believe
that it one didn’t know that the
director was gone, they couldn’t
tell the difference. In the current
wave of‘budget cuts, I have to
question why this position wasn’t
eliminated and permanently
replaced by R.A.s.

Considering the fact that the
position is so peripheral I also
have to question the recent con-
duct of the incumbent director,
Jenny Erickson. She discussed
elements of Georgia Dentel‘s job
description with a student, Susan
sink, and as a result, the student
wrote a letter to the Scarlet and
Black. Based on the iniormatiun
she had, Sink made a statement
which she felt was important and

should be shared with the entire
college community. Uniortunate-

ly, the information contained in
the letter was inaccurate and the
entire incident again calls to ques
tion the conduct oi a member or
the college’s administration.
Speciﬁcally, two major questions
are posed by the incident.
Firstly, why did Erickson
discuss the issue with a student?
Knowledge oi someone’s job
description does not give her
license to discuss the issue with
students. it the iniormation in the
letter is an indication ot what
Erickson told the student, then the
problem becomes even larger.
Clearly the iniormation was oi an
untlattering nature, and 1 strongly

question administrators activ-
questioning other administrate
or ior that matter, any perso
matters with students. In rec-
years students have seen the .
ministration agree with this po
tion, and although at times
seemed frustrating, I think it

a wise policy.

The second uestion involv
the specific cri Cisms articula
in the letter. Where did Sink
her information? She told Scar
and Black editor Jett Raymo
that Erickson was her source.
the letter is an accurate reflectl
of what Mrs. Erickson told
Sink, then I wonder why the int
mation itself was not accura
The letter does not reflect a cl
understanding of the job descr
tion, and since Ms. Sink recei
the iniormation from ErickSt
one has to wonder why this mis
formation was communicat
For example, the letter sugges
that Ms. Deniel, as partoi her j
was supposed to greet bands w
they arrive at the college. This
nonsense. Nowhere in the j
description is this task mention
This type of inaccuracy is v
dangerous.

The most disturbing element
this entire situation is that as 8.
week goes by, I learn more .
more about the way business
done at this schooligossip, ba
biting and hear-say are all a I
of the daily routine of the colle
Remember, if Sink did not wr
the letter, nobody would kn
about this type oi behavior. Ye
happens all the time. People
that this is just the way things .
in the real world. Perhaps, but
educational institution like Gr
nell should aspire to higher st
dards. Otherwise, the whole

proves one’s ability to think .
act in a logical manner is a b
at least at this school.
