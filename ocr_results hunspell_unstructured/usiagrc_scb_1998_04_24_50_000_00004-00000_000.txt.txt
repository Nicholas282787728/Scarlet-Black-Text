Bryan Dunham’ s
Movie Ranking Scale

EIEIEI Good

{’30 No Good

Before we begin, let me just apologize
for last week’s rating scale. ﬂs clever and
confusing as it was, I cannot take credit
for it. It was designed by one Gabe
Rodriguez, a hearty soul who’s always
good for a laugh when you’re in a funk.
ﬁnd he can lift 500 pounds over his head.
So, he gets the credit, not I.

Amistad
Directed by Steven Speilberg. Starring Anthony Hopklins,
Morgan Freeman, Djimon Hounsou

This is a historical piece about a Spanish ship which under-
goes a slave revolt, and the subsequent trial. It makes History
majors sick to their stomachs because of a few liberties taken
by the writers. But just because it’s a historical movie which
is not, in fact, historically accurate doesn’t mean it can’t be
damn entertaining. I have no idea if this is the case. It could
be good in one of those “alright, I have a renewed hope for
humanity” sort of ways. Then again, it could be one of those
patronizing, non—ﬁctional, extra-long sort of things too, and
that wouldn’t be good. All in all, Idori‘t know what to tell
you. It could be good, it could be bad. I’m leaning towards
not caring.

Rebel Without a Cause U U U

Directed by Nicholas Ray. Starring James Dean. That’s all
you need to know.

Rebel Without a Cause is an excuse for James Dean to act
cool, say some. Actually, I found that he didn’t really act that
cool at all, except for when he smokes (frequently), which
makes him one cool mofo indeed. But he befriends even the
nerdy, psycho kids who kill puppies with their mothers‘
pistols and who have abandonment issues. He hangs out at
the planetarium. He drives a car from the 405. He kills and
then feasts on the tender ﬂesh of his victims. So it’s not really
that he’s acting cool, he’s just doing the right thing. I wasn't
prepared for this. I was ready to be annoyed by his macho
posturing and nobody understanding him, but the movie
turned out a little differently.

I expected his father to be a real asshole, so he’d have
something to rebel against. Turns out his dad wants to be his
buddy. And he doesn’t care if he drinks all the time! That‘s
great! I would have no reason to rebel against that. But since
he’s not rebelling at all in this movie, it makes sense. And
there’s a kid named Plato in it. He gots problems. Unfortu-
nately, he oversimplifies them and projects them onto the
Deanster.

So, yes James Dean is sexy. Go see the movie for that
reason if you want. I thought this fact would kind of turn me
off to the movie and make me a little jealous. But no. He‘s a
good guy in the end.

PERFORNHNG FILM

invents ﬂubber, a sticky, stretchable material that lend
itself to many increadable uses. Even with MacMurry play

it is quite sane compaired to the heights to which Robin

Imagine working for four years at
Grinnell, cultivating your talent to its
greatest potential. When you have
almost fully completed your senior
year, you have the chance you've
earned to show off your talent. As a
goodbye to Grinnell, you perform a
recital for all to see. That‘s just what
pianists Melissa Booker ‘98 and
Mark Messer ’98 are scheduled to do
214200 pm on Saturday, April 25 in
Herrick Chapel at their Senior Rec
cital.

Booker will perform Sonata K.
330 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozan
and Nocturne. 0p. 9, N0. 1 and Noc-
fume, 0p. 27, No.) by Frederic
Chopin. Messer will perform several
two-part inventions, such as Ave

' Maria: Meditation an the First Pre-

lude ofJ.S. Bach by Charles Gounod,
Nocturne in CMl'rmr, 0p. Faith. by
Chopin, and Waltz in A-ﬂar Minor,
0p.39, No.15 by Johannes Brahms.

Messer will play with violinist
Melissa Roberts ’99 in the Gounod
selection.

“We are showcasing the work that
we have done over the past four
yearsAfter you study for four years,
it is nice to have a recital where ev-
eryone comes and you can play for
them. You don‘t have to audition first
and you don’t have to be spectacu»
lat," said Booker.

Both Messer and Booker took lesn
sons from Lecturer in Music Barbara
Lien. “Barb is a wonderful teacher.
She has helped me reached the level
of maturity that one needs to reach
in order to emotionally connect Wllh
the music. I didn’t have that in high
school. 1 wasn'l ready to play, but
once I came here I wanted to play
again," claimed Booker.

Unlike Booker, Messer didn’t take
lessons until hls second year at
Grinnell.
“I have
played for
only three

sons, but years ago because
everyone is trying to use
all the pianos at the

they hadn‘t. I think thatis something
I am going to feel if I stop now. It
will be difﬁcult to continue, butl re-
ally want to."

According to Messer and Booker,
practicing here has become harder to
do. “I practice for an hour every day
at least. All the pianos on campus are
scattered. There aren‘t practice
rooms. Sometimes you have to play
for people in the area,“ commented
Messer.

“It isn’t as easy to practice as it
was two years ago because everyone
is trying to use all the pianos at the
same time. With all the construction
[on the FineAns building], iihas got-
ten even more difﬁcult because ev-
eryone is in the same place, I used to
be able to just walk into a room, sit
down and play on a piano," said
Booker.

It seems as though more and more
people are playing instruments at
Grinnell, but they are silent masses.
Both Messer and Booker encourage
the musically gifted to play in pub-
lic and share their talent. “I wish that
more people would play and that
music was more visible on campus.
It would be cool if more people got
to see students play. That is what in-
spired me. I saw people play and
wanted to play myself," commented
Messer.
