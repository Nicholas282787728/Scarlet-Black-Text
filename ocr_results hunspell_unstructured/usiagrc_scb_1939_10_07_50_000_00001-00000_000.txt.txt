Rumors Rumble

On Clark Hall GRINNELL'S 'ONE MAN GANG'

‘Jaundice Job’

With the Addy old pigment on
the Clark hall door growing in-
creasingly yellow with age, theo-
ries, rumors, accusations, and
counter-accusations continue to
fly down the dormitory loggia.

While little over a week ago
blame for the "job" and prompt
retribution would have come ere
this time, the burying of the
hatchet between Dibble and Clark,
under the threat of the “axe” has
created a stalemate.

Even the two halls are divided
against themselves. Says Dibble
—-”We didn't do it, and if we
did, so what?”

Says Clark, "We suspect every-l
one, including the housemothers"

Meanwhile rumors of special in
vestigators from the F. B. 1.,
flown specially to Grinnell to
quiz local hardware merchantson
the sale of yellow paint, and
twinkling Dick Tracy badges be-
Death the shirts of Clark men
have been proved false.

Say four other halls in the dor-
mitory—“The Clark hall door
just got sick and jaundiceKL—no-
body done it."

fourth quarter the Bulldogs scored
their second touchdown. starting
on the 50-yard marker, Fisher,
aided by powerful blocking,
brought the ball down to the 8-
yard line. Two penalties on Grin-
nell at this point set the bail on
the 11/2 yard stripe from where
Fisher plowed through the right
side of the scarlet and black line
to chalk up six more points.
Harvey took the ball over for the
extra point, making the score

was picked up by Hamann, who
advanced to the Gnnnell 27.
After a stab at the line, Hamann

punted out of bounds to the
