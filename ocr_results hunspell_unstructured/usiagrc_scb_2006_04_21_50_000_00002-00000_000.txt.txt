lecture. “Phi Beta Kappa, Grinnell and the Liberal Arts,” will
explore the mysteries of Phi Beta Kappa membership and its
nearly oneahundredayear history. "As a Phi Beta Kappa memr
ber,1 want to discuss the importance of the national organiza-
tion and what it means to academia," Drake said in a college
press release. Drake is an alum oi the college, he was a Rhodes
and Fulbright scholar and served as president ofGrinnell for 12
years before retiring from that ofﬁce in 1991. He retired from

ing at Grinnell in 1958 and became a professor in 1964. Karen
van Dnsen 77 and Joel spiegel 78 granted the gift and chose

energy and his remarkable lecture style left an indelible mark
on us, his students," said Anne Spence 66 ot’Professor Graham

you for all the former students" Former students of Graham

should have that again."’Malik said,

The forum drew approximately 50 people, many in support
of the humorous initiatives. “Some of [the students] were just
there to hear about changing the name." said Malik. “But they

Patterson said that despite the light tone, the forum was
worthwhile. “it was runny, it was worth going to," she said.

Queer Students celebrate ten days of GLBTQQIA identities

Since Monday, things on campus have been a little more
queer, or at least more obviously so. Students are celebrating
Pride Week, an annual Grinnell and national event celebrating
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex
and ally (GLBTQCLIA) identities.

“[Pride week] strives to bring awareness and engage all our
students,” said Lester Aleman '07, one of the student organin
ers.“We want to educate them about the community,"

On Monday, Thea Hillman, an intersex activist and poet,
gave a presentation on intersex awareness and identity in Fo—
rum South Lounge. lntersex is used to describe a variety of
physical conditions that involve being born with physical char
acteristics that do not match up to standard divisions of male
and female. On Tuesday, students gathered outside Loose in a
clear weather, where Hillman read her poetry.

Throughout the week, the organizers held panels, presenta-
tion, games and activities "We do different kinds ofstuffm we
go from very serious to a lot offlin"said Aleman.

Activities will continue through the weekend and the mid-

 

ﬂ; This Week in Joint Board

~ A second SGA reform proposal, was introduced by Chris
Ochoa ’06 and Brendan Baker '06. This proposal would not
involve a second vice president but makes other, less drastic
changes. one change is moving the president and vice presia
dent elections earlier in the year so there will be more time for
president-elect and vice president-elect. It is unlikely that any
SGA reform will come into effect next by next semestett

' SCIPE was awarded 81900 for a panel debate on universal
health cale.

- The resolution creating a committee to advise tthrustecs
on socially responsible investing was passed by Joint Board.

- A resolution on wind power and a by—laws reform modify—
ing the Board's parliamentary procedure were introduced .

dle of next week.

Today, mreer Rainbow super Team, a student group that
aims to create awareness of queer communities though intra-
muml sports, will host Capture the Flag on Cleveland Beach.

on Sunday, Pride week will organize ally training, a facilia
rating workshop that will discuss the forms of oppression and
the ways to deal with it. “We will show them how they can turn
that into something proactive and how they can help advance
our community" said Aleman.

This upcoming Tuesday, students will organize a panel that
will discuss the intersection of race and homosexuality. The
panel comes on the heels of the recently revived student group
Queer Students of Color (OJ’OC) and will feature some ofthe
active students in the group.

The week will close with a Day of Silence on Wednesday,
when students symbolically protest the silence that society im-
poses on those with GLBTQQIA identities by going without
speaking {or twenty-four hours.

Ask the Presidenf

 

 

 

Grinnell is known for the liberal leanings
of its faculty and students. How do you
identify politically? Do you have any ad»
vice for students who feel as if they are
outside Grinnell’s political mainstream?

I think most people know that I am conservative by
inclination. l have voted for roughly equal nunibcrs of Dem-

ocrats and Republicans for president and have found my es-
timation of a candidate‘s personal probiry to be decisive in
several presidential elections. I vote at the state and local
level across the spectrum. I would encourage everyone who
votes to reject party affiliation as a deciding factor and to
vote for candidates based on their policy views. I generally
vote for intemationalisi candidates and support free trade
and relatively open borders in terms of immigration.
