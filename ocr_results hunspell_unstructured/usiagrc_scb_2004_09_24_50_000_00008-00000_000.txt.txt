I was more than ready for an overdue
foray into nature, conjuring picturesque
images of standing next to a campfire

in disbelief, claiming I had actually

Deboarding the plane, I fell down
three stairs in shock and fear; the

described as morbid stuffed bits of

ataxidermied unirnals, arid for

the profession itself, until

Greyhound. Actually
a viable alternative to

the sparse airstravel

Montana have much
to do with keeping
Greyhound afloat. Entering the state
from northern Wyoming, I noticed a
freakish coincidence: every town had a
taxidermist. Even the somewhat empty
settlements around the state, referred to
as"Boomtowns”fottheirsuddenerection

times without laundry facilities, hard-

bore the sign “Taxis

Encouraging dialogue

Picture the following scenario. At a conservative college a new
campus group, students for Choice, has formed They post signs
telling students when the first meeting will be and who to con
tact for more information Though most on campus are ambivar
lent toward the new group, home are ardently opposed to its very
existence, Upon seeing the posters, these abortion foes vandalize
them, crossing but "students for choice" and writing in “students
for murder." In addition, at the group‘s ﬁrst meeting, abortion foes
show up to heckle and intimidate the leaders.

Upon hearing this news, at large number ofciinnellians would
certainly express disgust, saying: “Those damn conservatives just
don't know how to respect others‘ opinions." If the college were
nearby, some student groups would probably organize a proschoiee
rally on belialfofthe aggrieved students.

Unfortunately, when this scenario’s polar opposite came to {fur
irion at Grinnell, there was no uproar, no show of disgust, nothing
except a stunning display of apathy from the student body. Over
the past few weeks, the newly formcd Grinncll Pro—Life group has
had a number of their signs vandalized to read “Students for Patti-
atchy" anti had pro-choice hecklets planted at their ﬁrst meeting.

Though we recognize that a majority on campus, including
most of the 5651? staff, are preschoice, we also understand that
there is inherent value in allowing snidents of any ideology to
freely associate and express their beliefs. Rather than view the for
titration of this group as a threat, prorclioice students should see
it as an opportunity to engage in dialogue that will broaden both
sides’vienpoints.

The actions taken by some pro—choice students were not only
in poor taste but also counterproductive to their cause. It is com-
mon sense that those who are ridiculed will not change their posi-
tion, bur only feel ctnboldencd to push harder, Last year, gay rights
advocates on campus took a different route when faced with signs
of opposition. Rather than mock and intimidate their intellectual
adversaries, they helped sponsor a series of successful debates on
gay marriage. They were able to advance their agenda by dehunle
ing myths that characterize the gay marriage debate. Pro-choice
students would be wise to follow the same model.

The reactionary response of some students also lends unwar-
ranted credcnce to the claim that colleges need mandated intel-
lectual diversity Last spring, conservative activist David Horowitz
visited campus to claim that colleges were intolerant toward con-

 

 

 

servative points ofview and, among other things, needed to con

sider intellectual diversity in the admissions process. A member of,
the board ofmistees espoused similar views last yean'rhere is good
evidence that such a mandate is practically impossible to enforce
and based on the false premise that liberal students are not'exposed
to a wide range ofvicws, Nonetheless, when these arguments are
juxtaposed with instances of liberal intolerance, the claims of
Horowitz and others sadly become much more persuasive.

Finally, the inappropriate actions of some pro—choice students
and the apathetic response from the strident body illustrate a will~
ingness to support self-governance in word, but not in action. Stur
dents regularly bemoan the death of self—governance, but rarely
show drat we deserve it. For instance, self-governance is predicated
on the values of personal responsibility and commitment to com—
munity, which were both absent in the events described. If students
are ever to mount a successful challenge against the administra-
tion, we must ﬁrst treat each other with dignity and respect,
