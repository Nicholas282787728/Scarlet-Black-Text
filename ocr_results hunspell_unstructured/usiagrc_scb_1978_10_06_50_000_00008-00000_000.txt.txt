Massage workshop held

behind closed doors

by Nancy Gould

Some residents of Dibble Hall
thought an orgy was keeping them
from enjoying Sunday afternoon
football. Others peered through
cracks in the door to get an in
depth View of the situation. Until
today, the mystery of last Sunday's
event in Dibble lounge has
remained unsolved.

What occurred was a day of
complete relaxation for 12
members of Loose and Read halls.
Jim Jeffers, a student at Maharishi
International University who is

not anyone can call himself a
masseur and go about conducting
sessions in college lounges Jeffers
is a proiessional, licensed
masseur, In Iowa masseurs are
not licensed. but in some states.
like Hawaii, licensing is a com
plicated procedure. In Hawaii a
masseur must go through a
physical and show his expertise on
the subject before receiving a
professional certificate,

technique but can also judge how
tense a person is just by looking at

also a professional masseur.
’ taught students the art of massage.
Throw away those sinister ideas of
orgies on campusiactually. a
massage workshop was underway.

THIS IS NOT TO say that the
event was completely innocent in
nature. As one member em-
phatically stated upon noticing a
camera outside of the lounge, “I
want those negatives destroyed,”
But most of the workshop was
innocent—Jeiiers merely
demonstrated his technique. What
is this technique and how did
Jeffers learn the secret of a great
massage?

Jeffers learned his art a few
years ago in Hawaii. There, he took
an eight-week course at a school
for massage. probably spending
his time massaging worn-out
surfers and hula girls. (Doesn’t
everyone surf and hula in Hawaii?)

THE TECHNIQUES he learned
at this school were the Swedish and
Japanese methods of massaging,
Jeffers describes the Japanese
method as the “tension point
technique," He opted for the
Swedish method for his massages.
' He describes this Swedish
massage as being similar to
“squeezing toothpaste from a
tube." Jeffers uses this method
exclusively, but says that he
adopted it a bit so that he can feel
comfortable with the method,

ALTHOUGH THERE are many
different massaging techniques,

 

him, Jeffers said that the amount
“of tension in a body is evident in a
person‘s walk, stance and actions.
Additionally, he says that certain
professions produce many more
tense people than others.

OBVIDUSLY: certain types of
.people are more likely to need a‘
good massage than others. Jetiers
3has found that the students at his
‘university, MIU, need massage
after meditation, He feels that they
need this to bring them back to an
ordinary state.

Sometimes being an authority on
the subject is difficult for Jeffers,
A masseur gains instant popularity
as soon as he mentions his skill.
Jeffers doesn’t like to mention
.what he does to people any more
because ”it got ridiculous."
Whenever he makes even the
slightest mention of his massaging
the immediate reaction he receives
is: “Do me!” Jeffers now avoids
mention of his special powers in
order to escape giving continuous
massages.

JEFFERS ALSO encounters
other difficulties. He feels that the
reputation of American massage
parlors gives the professional
masseur a bad name. “In Europe,
massage is perfectly acceptable,”
he comments, but adds that
massage in the U.S. has a
disreputable image.

Another problem of the masseur
is in the name of his profession. A
masseur' is'a malethat mas

while a masseuse is a female
massager. Call Jeffers a masseuse
and he probably won’t treat you to
any of his skills.

as FOR His philosophy on
massage, Jelfers feels that it is
necessary to have a well—
functioning, tension-free body in
order to survive. As he stated at
the Sunday workshop, “The pur-
pose of life is to enjoy yourself,”
According to Jeffers, one can’t
enjoy oneselleth excess tension in
the body. Jeffers‘s workshops are
directed at getting rid of this
tension through a proper massage.

The first point to remember in
giving a massage, according to
Jeffers, is that it must take place in
the proper setting, Jeffers suggests
that the massage be given on the
floor as opposed to on a bed, a
common misconception or those
unfamiliar with the art. The room
should be approximately 70
degrees, it should be quiet and the
lights should be dim. Also. the
massage requires some privacy.

IN HIS WORKSHOP on Sunday
he began with some yoga to loosen
up the students. He then told them
the purpose of massage: to relieve
tensions and get the body tuner
tioning.

Actual massaging then began.
Jeffers started with the hands,
back, feet and legs, later
progressing to other parts of the
body, The method he uses requires
that the parts of the body be done in
a certain order. It is also essential
that the masseur wet his hands
with oil before beginning the
massage~without this the
massage can be an uncomiortable
experience.

Jarrens recommends ap-
plying pressure to the area one is
massaging because it “feels
good.” Hands should be relaxed
and molded to the body and then
should squeeze the muscles. In
literature on the topic he em.
phasizes paying attention to your
subject. He or she isn't just a
”hunk of muscle."

He also had a few other imr
portant pointers for giving
massages. Jeffers believes that
experimentation is essential to a
good massage And like com-
parable “sports," practice makes

perfect‘or as stated in hls
literature, ”Practice, so it
becomes second naiure, like
playing an instrument."

LASTLY, AND most importantly
to some, Jeffers suggests that the
masseur should get a massage for
himsell. It's good to know how a
massage feels.

Besides the obvious benefits of
feeling good and relieving tension,
there are other merits of a
massaged body. Those who par-
ticipated in the workshop im-
proved their circulation and
relieved Congestion in their bodies.

ANOTHER CLAIM made by
Jeffers’s literature is that
“massage increases the excretion
or ﬂuids and waste products of
protein metabolism, inorganic
phosphorus and salt in normal
individuals.” (Sounds good,
doesn’t it?) Massage can also
compensate for the lack of physical
activity that many suffer from,
although it is not recommended as
a complete substitute ior exercise.

A last and most interesting claim
is one of particular interestto those
students on board, “According to
some authorities. massage may
burst. the fat capsule in sub
cutaneous tissue so that fat exudes
and becomes absorbed.” In this
way, massage can be an aid to
reducing.

ONE OF THE MOST common
massages on campus, infamous for
great pleasure as well as possible
seduction, is the back massage.
Jeffers gives the following
description ior completion of the
perrect back massage:

First the masseur spreads oil on
his subject's back. With long
strokes, the whole back is
massaged, Then circles are done
with thumbs along the spinal cord,
but’ the bones aren’t touched,
Jeffers recommends strokes on due
back, circling the shoulder blade,
and long pushing strokes up die
whole side of the back. The
massage is finished with long
strokes down the entire back,

JEFFERS READILY shares his
technique with those who want to
enter the world of instant
popularity that he enjoys. He will
be conducting another workshop
this weekend for residents of
Dibble and Norris halls, assuming
that he can take the time away
from MIU,

When you walk past Dibble
lounge this Sunday be assured that
they're nothaving an orgy in there,
Take your beer and watch the
game in another dorm, because
Jim Jeffers is sharing his massage
technique with some other tension»
filled students.
