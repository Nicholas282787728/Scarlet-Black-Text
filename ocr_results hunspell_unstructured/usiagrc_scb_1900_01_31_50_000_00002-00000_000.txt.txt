IN AN editorial on the foot ball
season of’gg. the Drake pup/m
says: “The only discordant factor
in Iowa ls the work oftheTripleAlr
liance. But this unnatural ceature
will soon die of internal jealousy.
S. U. I. has achieved the only entl
she had in mind. She has worked
her game well, and as the season
closes, to her is conceded, without
question, tlle champion football
honors tor '90- The only remain~
ing question is, will the ring IClld-
ers cease lr om their mildrthrowillg
antics and once more assume the
appearance or gentlemen. The
smaller colleges are becoming dlsr
satisﬁed with the existing Colldir
tions. It is to be hoped that be-
fore another numhet'of the Dal/Mir
goes forth, representatives from
the interested schools rvrll get too
gather and realize that this chlld's
play is beneath the dignrty of
college students.” Drake can
give considerable advicealongthis
line.

ALL FRIENDS oi the college will
regret to learn that Mr. C. S. \Nlir
Iiston, '93, the representatire of
Iowa College on the graduate Com-
mittee of the W, LA. A. A., has
been compelled by bllsrnesstlutles
to lesign the posrtlon which he
has held since 1895, During this
time Mr. williston has proven
himself a valuable member of the
committee. and has served once as
secretary. At all times he has
striven tor the welfare of the col-
lege, and the Athletic Union is
heartily sorry for the loss or his
servxces. We print a few words
from one o[ his letters in order to
show the attitude of our alumni
toward the college, There can be
no greater incentive to well-doing
on the part of our athletes Mr,
\Nllliston says:

We are fortunate in having in
Mr. W. J. Pringle, '85, agentleman
who can so ably succeed Mr. Wil-

Pl‘ingle, while a student here. had
much to do with developing the

the college into promineneein that

pitcher of no mean ability. Since
his graduation, he has spent sevr

Mr Pringle was elected to the po-

Iackson of Lake Forest. For the
convenience of anyone desiring to
communicate with him, he will
