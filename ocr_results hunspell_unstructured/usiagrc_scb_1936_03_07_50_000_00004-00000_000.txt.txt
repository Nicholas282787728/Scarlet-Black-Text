GRINNELL'S OWN

Drulie 37, Gl‘lllllell 35. Thus read the score hoard last
night, but it did not tell 1 ll" of the tale ol’ the gallant battle
which the present 19 ' 36 basketball aggregation waged, nor
of the numerous other Similar lights which have horn fought
this year. t

Ill retrospect, the season has not been a huge slwcoss as
far as games won and lost are concerned, for Grillllcll has lost
far more than she has won, but there is one thing that has
stood out both ill \‘lCtOl ‘ and in defeat, and that is the uncou-
querzthle determination and fight, which has marked the play
ot the team in every game.

The season, measured by tllis standard, has been a huge
success, and the people who have witnessed the play ot‘ the
Pioneers have indeed had the opportunity 0t", Seeing that ad
mil-able part of human characterioourage and stout hearted-
tlcssibeing displayed. That ill itself, means u ss.

To the members of the 193036 C llluell lr :cthall squad
.we pay tribute. Even though you did not win great umnhers
of Victories, still, always you showed the (lauutlc's (il‘llll’lcll
spirit, and for that alone is (trinnell glad to claim you as her
own.
