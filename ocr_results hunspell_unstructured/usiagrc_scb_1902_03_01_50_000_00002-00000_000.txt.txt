CARLET nan BLACK wishes
to join The Unit manage-
ment in urging the students to
Compete tor the prize which has
been offered for the best college
song. Althoughcrinncll already
has some good songs, there is
room for many others, and with
all the enthusiasm there is here
for the music department, and the
musical organizations, there is no
reason why good songs should
not be torthcoming. Iowa col-
lege is famous for her spirit, and
it seems not too much to expect
that thls spirit should be the in
spiration of songs which will rep-
resent the real Grinnell life. We
sincerely hope that the effort
which 7/12 Unit is making will
meet with abundant success.

The games ill all be played on
Iowa ﬁeld. With the other two
practice games with Drake and
Grinnell and the big game with
Minnesota. the home schedule is

, an excellent one,”

HERE can be no doubt that

for a school of Grinnell's

size, the museum here is an ex-
ceptionally good one. The col-
lection is unusually complete, and
includes many rare specimens, It
is a museum with which all the
students should be familiarI and of
which all may be proud. It may
well be questioned, however, how
long this will continue to be true,
if the museum does not receive
better attention than it receives
at present. Maths and beetle
larvae are working great ruin to
many of the most valuable speci-
mens, and unless something is
done to check the destruction that
is going on, it will only be a ques-
tion of a short time until many at
the mounted specimens wrll be
beyond all hope of preservation,

Already many ot them are seem-
ingly at that point, The whole
museum needs a thorough ovcr-
hauling. It is well understood that
economy must attend all the acts
of the college authorities, but the
spending of the money necessary
to preserve the museum wouldnot
be considered extravagance or
needless expense. The best econr
omy would be to take this matter
in hand, before the necessary ex-
pense hecorne any greater.
