SCARLET AND BLACK

November II, [955

E’ioneers Edge. Knox l3-l2

by Arnie Alpert

Before an enthusiastic homecoming crowd at Galesburg,
111., last Saturday, Grinnell came from behind to put a damper
on Knox’ football celebrations with a 13-12 win over the 01d
Siwash. A gathering of 2500 viewed the proceedings as Grinnell

gained its third victory in seven

games, moving into a filth—place

Midwest conference tie with Ripon — each team with a 2—4
league record. The loss was the sixth in seven contests for

Knox.

It was necessary for the Pie
neers to stage a pair of come—
‘back scoring successes and to
thwart a lastsquarter Knox
drive betore emerging with the
closely contested decision. Knox
had moved the ball to the arm—
nell 16 with only two minutes
left in the game, but the Pio-
neer line held firm and stymied
this last-ditch scoring attempt
by the home forces.

Shaffer Kicks tExtra Point

Sophomore halcﬁback Jack
Shadfer provided the winning
margin by kicking the extra
point after fullback Sam Feb
rotf‘s late first quarter touch-
down. Besides kicking the vital
point. Shaffer led Grinnell in
rushing with 91 yards in 13
carries, punted twice for 85
yards,. and averaged 24 yards
per-carry on punt and kickoff
returns.

First blood in the scoring was
drawn by Knox when, after
only five plays, fullback Mondo
Lopez pulled over from the 5-
yard line. Frank Stanicek miss-
ed what later proved to be the
all-important extra point.

Action seessawed back and
forth during the most part of
the firstouarter until petroff
shared a lateral attempt by
Knox quarterback Frank Casey
and raced 32 yards, evading
three tacklers, for Grinnell’s
first score. it was Petroﬁf‘s fifth
touchdown of the season, giv-
ing him the lead in individual
Pioneer scoring with 33 poinm.
Shaffer added the conversion.

Knox Passing Stopped

Knox resumed the olfansive
during the second-quarter and
finally tallied when haliﬂback
Art Carlson went four—yards
over right hackle for a touch-
down, giving Knox a 127 ad-
advantage. Stanicek, who again
missed the conversion, and fullv
back Mal Edwards had set up
the score wth coward drive vha
repeated successions of first-
down runs, ranging from 7 to
25 yards.

The old Siwash undoubtedly
could have added to their score
had not halfbacks Warren Sand-
ler and Scotiy Walker rescued

To the Editor:

. . .the United states are
breaking up; New England, if
made to feel the rod of Brit-
ish maritime power, might re-
turn in her old allegiance."

~Lord Sheffield. . .1733.

This statement represents
Britian’s first abortive attempt
at regaining her lost colonies.
Today, we say, surely the U. K.
has no such plot in mind, but
let's briefly examine recent
events to see if our security is
false.

The first manifestation of
new designs on our sovereignty,
and the one to which this letter
is devoted, is a recent sartorial
subversion promoted by a
formidable combination of Lon~
doners, the self-appointed world
stylists of men’s wear, and the
New England clothing industry.
To give the movement a dDmESs
tic flavor the old “Ox-ford look"
has become the ”Ivy League
look", but the “Oxford shoe”,
the “Oxford-cloth shirt", and
the “porkapie” terms remain.
Early this month, readers may
have noticed in the Des Moines
Register an ad for Ivy League
suits stating that these, “do
more for you than a college
education", Not only would they
bind us by having us wear their
costume, but would have us
suibstitute it for education in
order that we might be ignorant
of their evil plot! Surely more
proof could be offered if space

Grinnell with timely interceps
tions of Case-"s passes. Gary
Pattschull, who alternated with
Petroilf at fullback, also hind-
ered the Knox offensive with
consistent 5-yard penetrations
through the Siwash line.
Sandler Tallies Second TD
Grinneii received several op-
portunities to take the lead after
the half, but couldn’t capitalize
on them. Shaffer and Walker
had reached the Knox 1 yard
line after runs of 34 and 18
yards, respectively, but Knox
regained control of the hall and
protected its slim lead. Lopez
helped things considerably by a
21 yard dash around right end,
which moved the ball out of the
danger zone.

Haines hall won the field
hockey trophy recently after
an almost perfect season, marred
only by one tie with Read.
Read's record for this, the first
intramural tournament of the
year, was very good too, shaw~
mg only two defeats (both from
Haines) and one tie. The double
elimination tournament got very
hot at the end, with Read trys
ing very hard to win the trophy
for the third straight year. and
thereby keeping it permanently.
But the cold weather and
Haines’ determination seemed
to be too much, and Read fin-
ally had to give in. Main look
the third position, showing a
lot of power and teamwork for
a freshman hall. Loose, Cleve»

that order.

lic this week its choice of the

ers on the campus by naming
them to the honor team. Their
selection was made from lists

men. The girls will be divided
into teams and play one game as

Despite this earlier frustra-
tion, Grinnell finally proved
that the law of averages still
was with it during the fourth-
quarter. Warren Sandler's 9-
yard pass to end Paul Jones was
complete to put the ball on the
Knox 20. Halfbacks Gordie
Loucks and walker moved the
ball up to the one-foot line be-
fore Sandler crashed over with
the winning touchdown, giving
Grinncll a 13-12 lead with seven
minutes left. Shaffer’s extra
point attempt was blocked,

With Lopez and Carlson pav-
ing the way, Knox quickly re-
covered and moved the ball to
the Grinnell 20-yard line. with
fourth down and 5-ya1-ds to go
for a first down, two minutes
were left in the game. Edwards
fought fiercely to pick up the
five yards on a plunge through
center, but was stopped by the
Grinnell line on its own ls—one
yard shy of his objective. Grin-
nell ran out the clock rwith
rushing attempts.
