DR. STEINER LEADS CHAPEL.

The Friday morning service was led
by Dr. E. A. Steiner, who spoke on the
situation in Russia at the present
time. The following is an outline oi
his talk:

The suddenness at events in Russia
while a matter of surprise, is, never-
theless, explained by Russia’s history.

There are four periods in her national
development.

I. The period of unconscious his.
tory up to the twelrth century.

11. The period of national growth
and expansion, to Peter the Great.

III. Tire period oiconstructive his.
tor-y, marked by bad blunder-s in every
direction.

IV. The period of constitutional
government, having its beginning
somewhere in the last two years.

The oppres e government which
laid all the burdens upon the lower
classes is reaping its reward, and three

bringing about the present revolution.

auditorium chairs were fairly well
ﬁlled, perhaps 125 being in atLendunce

Dr. Steiner had every reason to be
pleased with his reception last even-
ing. The club welcomed him back
with tumultous applause, and every
possible evidence or the intense appre-
ciation Mitrshalltown audiences have
of the cosmopolitan preacher-profess-
or sociologist. It. was scarcely the
welcome of an audience to a favorite
lecturer, but more the greeting of
friends to a itiend, and the professor,
showing in the expression of Voice and
manner his recognition of the person-
al nature of the greeting, came halt
