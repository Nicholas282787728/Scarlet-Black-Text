noon, the students left the ad
ministration building. Once out
side, they held an improptu and
candid discussion of tlle morning’s
events with about one hundred
students and 381G workcrs. They
explained their actions, those of
the administration, and again
appealed for more student support.

The administration presented its
final offer the striking B&G
workers on Saturday, the 23 and 26
cent staggered wage increases and
the addition of 1 holiday at the
colleges discretion It was voted on
and rejected by the workers the
same day. President Leggett then
offered to hold a meeting with the
Strikers to explain why this offer
was the colleges final The workers
indicated that they would not at
tend the meeting unless the group
of students who had staged the sit-
in at Nollen House were allowed to
be present. The administration felt
that the meeting should be a closed
one, but finally allowed the group
of students to attend.

At the meeting in the Veterans
Memorial Building in Grinnell,
Leggett indicated that for financial
reasons, this was the colleges last
otter. As it stood then, the package
offer would cost the college
$105,000 over a period of two years,
and the college simply could not
afford any more. Later, Leggett
said in an interview, “ . . . how is
the college (to be) protected? I
can’t write a blank check.” He also
indicated that it wasn’t an “un-
pleasantmeeting,” although it ivas
tense, and that a lot of questions
were asked.

When people say lowan Soil is
rich, they’re not just-talking about
minerals. The soil around us teelns
with animal life, from microscopic
Protozoa to creeping mites to
burrowing moles.

These animals were the subject
of a talk by professor Kenneth A.
Christiansen: “Animal Life of the
Soil,” given Tuesday night to thc
Grinnell Chapter of the Audubon
Society,

Christiansen noted that most
people are unfamiliar with soil

, organisms, which in temperate
- climates comprise onerfilth to one
. third of the total animal biomass.

The gay movement on campus

that formed was primarily aimed
at helping each other accept our

open and honest about their
sexuality; it is infinitely harder for
those attracted to members of the

The fungi and bacteria complete
the nutrient cycle. Virtually the
only way new supplies of nitrogen
can enter the system is through
nitrogen-fixers like the rootsnodule

Soil animals work with the plants
in a system which recycles the soil
resources. It is human agricultural
demands and pesticide spraying
which may upset this.

SORRY. OUR ERROR

maneuver " That maneuver
proved to be too adept, since the
hall funds were increased by 50
cents. not per cent,

Empty seats threaten service

from Diane Roston
Four women took up the College's offer to provide transportation to
Des Moines in an effort to facilitate access to gynecological services.
The Wednesday shuttle service went smoothly, and the women
reported satisfaction with Dr. Faulina Fong, the gynecologist selected

by the Health Service committee.

According to evaluation sheets the women filled out later, one
participant reported, “The doctor is happy to listen to your questions
and answer them,” Another student was pleased that “he explained
what he was doing beforehand and showed me his instruments.”
Confidence

Others felt that Dr. Fong provided a sense of security and generally
inspired confidence. “I felt comfortable with him, and felt that he was
quite adequate." One comment summed up the group's feeling, saying
“I think this is a good temporary solution to Grinnell’s gynecological

service. "

One drawback to the service, however, is that it must be taken
advantage of to justify the hour and a half blocked out each Wed-
nesday afternoon [or Grinnell women, If less than six women use the
service every week, the alloted time slot for Grinnellians may be

reduced or discontinued,

Tuesday sign up
Women interested in the Des Moines gynecological service should
sign up in the Health Center Tuesday for the Wednesday ride into the
capital, Patients will be considered on a firstrcomeiirstrserved basis, I
although substitutions may be made in case of emergency.
