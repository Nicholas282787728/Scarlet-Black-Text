The lootliall game today is one or

Homecoming and its Commencement

some the football game is the ‘main

As Dr, Steiner said last year, ”A
college is not greater than its alumni.
That is true. But alumni might for—j

OUR ALIBIS.
The Grillnell or today has

some
excuses and an
non of the past.

We are not ashamed oi the things
we have done but they do hear ex-
plmtlon in the light at what the
alumni may think Of us. The truth
is, our sin is round in failing to do.
not in what we have done.

one or our acuons was to abolish
both men and women’s literary ‘so-
clotted. To us it has seemed a
mullet trlvial ailalr that does not
be: much stress, but to some oi our
alumni who experienced their great
est joys of college fellowship in the
society halls, who profess that they
owe_their ionodstlon for success in
lilo to their society training, we iecl

THE FIRST GMLE.
The Pioneer footlmll schedule liar
gins today.

We have played three games but
they have not counted. Our success
in them has been moderate, the only
thing we have done so lui is uncover
potential strength.

Today we are playing the iirst
Valley conference game and it really
matters. From now on every game
is an affair of serious consequence. ‘

We should realize that this year
above all others is one in which we
have a chance for a conference chem-
pionship. Already each of the live
teams on our schedule, except Ames.
has met a conference defeat. From
now on we are in a strategic position
in the Valley7provrdcd we start right
today.
