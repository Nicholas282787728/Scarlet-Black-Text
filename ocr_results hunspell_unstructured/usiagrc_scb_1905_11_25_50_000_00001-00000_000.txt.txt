A TOUCHDOWN FESTIVAL.

The LightTeam from Simpson is neieated
by the Record~brcaking Score or
Seventy-live to morning.

0naslippery field and in the pres
ence of a few hundred spectators, the
pl'utegrs of Mike Bergen and Terry
Fiske demonstrated the not that they
could rnalre touchdowns as fast as any

\ other team, provided they were given
\the opportunity. Simpson came, saw
and were overwhelmed by the amazing
score of? to o. It was a ﬁtting close
to a season which though successful in
the main, has been characterized by
anunusualnumberof lowscores. With
every regular in the line up, McKertn
being the only exception, the Grinnell
team went into the game determined
toexceed, or at least equal the score
made by the Drake team agianst Simp~
son. How well they succeeded, is
now a matter of history,

The Simpson team ,was light and
not especially inst. The players rought
gamely to the end and at no time
showed any signs or quitting. The
odds were too great ior them and they
could not stem the irresistible tide
which swept them on their reet. Once
at the beginning and again at the
very close "did the team hold the
wearers cf the Scarlet and Black, but
their braces were only momentary.
0n the odensivc, they practically
madeno gains at all and made ﬁrst
down only three times. Yucli‘ey at
right end played astrong game and
several times tackled the man with
the ball tor a loss.

The game was callcdntsﬂs. Captain
Auracher won the toss and chose to
receive the hall at the south goal. 0n
receiving the bail, Grinnell advanced
rapidly to Simpson’s one yard line
where the ball was lost on dotns.
Simpson attempted to gain but were
unsuccesstul and so were rorced to
punt. Thc liicl: was blocked and
Grinneil got the ball. Two minutes

Alter the ii i-st touchdown the game
turned into n rout and it became
evident that the size or the score
would depend to a large extent on the
length Ol- time llli‘tb the Grinnell
players could lreep up their iast pace.
It told on the victors :ahnost as much
as on the vanquished.

The sccondtouchdown was scored by

“A bluff is a. good thing to have un-
less the other fellow has a. good one;
then you need a punch to follow it up
with." This, with the idea slightly
touched upon that. ”clothes do not
make the man,” is the slim and sub-
tahco oi the ﬁrst partof Jack London's
story oi his experiences as he gave
them at the Congregational church
last night. The last part seemed to
have no particular application, iurther
than it was itpni'tiitl explanation of
why he became a Socialist,

After the speaker of the evening had
been given the privilege of the plat»
form by Professor Ryan, he entered
upon a rather tedious explanation of
why he was on the lecture platform,
and further that all the experiences
he related were strictly true. As to
this last assertion some are in doubt,
since he told swries of life of which
we in this part or the country have no
conception, bucas there is no evidence
to disprove any cl his statements, and
as the gentleman had no motive for
tellingialsehoods, we should be willing
to accept them as facts. His ﬁrst few
experiences, given with too much do-
tail and repetition however, promised
well. They were devoted to a devel-
opment or the idea that many a battle
is Won without a blow. but when the
other man is pursuing the same “bluff-
ing" tactics it must end in Something
