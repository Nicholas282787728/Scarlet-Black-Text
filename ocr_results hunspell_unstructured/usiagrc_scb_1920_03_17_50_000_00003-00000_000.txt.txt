Season-«Prospects Bright For Next Year

Season Not Considered
Failure Despite Many
Defeats.

By Vincent Yager.

While the 1920 basket hall season
can not be called a success from the
standpoint of games won, Pioneer
sport lollowers are far from feeling
that the season was a failure. Due to
circumstances beyond the control of
either coach or players, preliminary
practice had to be abandoned, and this
was but the ﬁrst notice of the jinx
which pursued the team all season.

Four members or last year's quintet
were missing lrom the lineup this
year, Three of the men, Captain Home
moud, Linn, and DcRuyter. did not r
turn to school, while the death of Cap—
taiireleot Crane left a position which
could not be ﬁlled satisfactorily. Win—
ter and Evans from last year's squad,
together with Wasseuaar. who played
several varsity games two years ago,
were thc only veterans, all three men
being Juniors.

Practice Cut Shorh

The ﬁrst disappointment came when
the enlorced coal vacation caused the
clftss series to be abandoned, thus cut-
tillg on every chance for preliminary
practice. Curl Compton, who came to
Gl-inncll last fall to spend the year as

Y. M. C A. secretary, was given charge l

of the squad, Winter being elected.
captain. Compton, a former Grin-
ncll and Oberlin star, bnd Almost un-
sul‘mouninblc obstacles
with, but he started in the work with
every energy. Five days after retul' -
ing from their long vacation, the Pl -
neel's played their ﬁrst game, against
the Penn College quintet, and despite
the lock or practice won out by the
easy fashion, 23 to 15.

In the second game of the season,
against the strong Des Moincs Y. M,
C. A, ﬁve, the Pioneer. showed an im-
proved brand of team work, and lies
feated the "Y” in a last game by an
18 to 15 count, The next. week the
Grinnell Squad iourncyed to Manhat-
tan, where they engaged the Kansas
Aggies in a two-game series, losing the
ﬁrst game 32 to 5, and the second con-
test 20 to 15.

Drhlic Wills.

Drake university, with the best team
they have perhaps ever had, Won a
victory January 24 by all is to 11
count. The game was last through
out, the Pioneers losing bccztus'e of in-
ability to make good on short range
shuts. The next Wednesday Grinnell

defeated the Col: college quintet, which“

had previously won from Carleton, in
easy fashion, 23 to 15.

TWO days after the cue game, Washr
illgiou University of St, Louis, runners
up in the Missouri Valley conference.
came to Grilmell for the best game of
the season. The Pioneers had by this
time reztclled midseuson form, and af-
tcl‘ a, fast and furious some the count
stood at 24 all. In the extra period,

 

the Pioneers got one basket While {he

Pikers succeeded in getting two, win—
ning 28 to 26. In the return games
iii St. Louis the next Week, the Filters
annexed both contests, the ﬁrst 27 to
15 and the second 26 to 16, Both games
were hard fought, and much basket-
bztll ability was displayed, but the
games were costly to the Pioneers, as
Evans, égular forward, was badly ill—
jured. ,

Will From Allies.

Kansas University, who ﬁnished
third in the conference. defeated a
patched up Pioneer lineup a week
later by a score of 42 to 11. Evans was
torced out for almost the remainder
of the season by his injury, and Shoe-
smith's illncss necessitated almost an
entire new team. Theresult was a
slow and one-sided game. February
2d the Alnes quintet came to Grinnell
and went back home oni the short end
of a 13 to 12 count. The game was
slow, and marked the Fiuneers' ﬁrst
Missouri valloy win. VHerbrcchtss
ineyer nllcrl Evans’ place with con-

isiderahle ubiliiy.

In the two remaining Missouri val-
ley games, the Pioneers, handicapped
by Evans‘ absence and Shoesmith‘s
sickness, lost to Drake 14 to 9 and to
Amos 35 to 27. both games being
closely contested. With the original
lineup together in the last game of the
season, the Pioneers gave the Cornell

quintet a hard battle, although llnallyi

being nosed out 30 to 22.
Prospects Good.

Coach Cal‘l Compton, who came to
Grinnell without thought of being our
pointed basketball coach, took hold

with a great deal of energy, and built,

up a quintet which forced the power-
l'ul Washington team to the limit to
win, only to see his Work undone by
injuries to players. necessitating al-
most another start. Much. credit is
given to Compton for the Way in
which he met difficulty after diffi—
culty, and sport followers would like
to see him leading next year's veteran
quintet.

All of theregular dye and all but‘
one of the substitutes on the squad
will be back next year. Daubenbere
ger is the only man who graduates,
but hi presence will be missed.
“Danny" has been a rsithiul candidate
for basketball honors, and although
not getting into vcl'Y many games, his
Wol‘ll on those occaslons Was steadY.
and at Manhattan he played perhaps
the best game at his career. Winter
and Wasscnaar are as. good a pair
ot guards as can be found, the latter
also being a. splendid offensive player.
Vinse’l at center played his ﬁrst year or
\arsity basketball, but showed up well
and will be a ﬁne center next season.
Evans is one of the heaviest scoring
fol-wards in the conference, While
Shoesnnth is as fast and shifty a for—
ward as Grinnell has had in some
time, besides having a sure eye for
baskets. W1 th Herbroohtsmcyer.
Miller. Macy and several others back
next season, Grinnell fans can look
forward to a most successful year.

Strongest Eel) Squad
In Years Finishes
Good Season.

Playing in the last game of the class
series and also of the 1920 basket-
ball season Saturday afternoon, the
Freshman team brings to a close a most
successtul season. The class of '23
has produced the strongest Prep
squad of several years, and promises
to give the regulars on the varsity
stiff competition for their places next
year,

The yearlings played only two out-
side games and won both of them. The
first one, against the local American
Legion Post, was characterized by its
roughness, both sides being guilty, but
with the men of the Legion the worst
oftcndcrs. The latter were compelled
to make so many substitutions, due to
lack of condition, that they hid an
entirely ditierent- team on the floor at
the end or the scrap The score was
20 14.

As,a curtaiusraiser to the Ames
game here on Feb. 20, the Preps plays
ch Marshalltown ng1 taking the long
end of a 26712 score . Good, snappy
teamwork on both sides was the out-
standing leaturc or this game, no ludi—
Vindulll stars lighting the horizon.
The Leshmcll had a decided adrau— p.
;tagc not only in size but in superior
ltrnm work, allowing the Marshalltown
"nggregtttion but few chances for ﬁeld
goals.

Captain Whitehill had excellent mu—
iterial in such men as Hoyt, Gossard,
