invasion oi New York. He did
write it in the early nineties,
and while many a play con.

yellow in the intervening years,

We are not happy as we
announce the loss of Mrs. Flan‘

year. The advancement she has
given Grinnell dramatics is be-

we do know the plays produced
under her direction have been
given the touch and polished
ﬁnish which spell the difference
betwen a rich masterly produc-
tion and one which remains in
mediocrity,

miliar with the original ending
which nearly every movie show
during the past ten years her
been using. The hero and
heroine meet in fond embrace
and the picture ends just before
the parting at. the end of a two-
minute kiss. Isn’t it disgusting
to havethe same old thing time
after time‘.7 It reminds one of
the fairy tales we used» to read
or have read to us where ”They
lived happy ever afterward."
Here is your chance to see
something original. Bernard
Shaw gets away from this com-
monplace stuff. The ending
surprises you and will send you
away with a satisﬁed smile.

a doubt on' the reality of our
civilization. No more hoary
superstition survives than that
the donning of a uniform
changes the nature of the
wearer. This notion pervades
society to such an extent that
when we ﬁnd some soldiers
placed upon the stage acting
rationally, our conventionalized
senses are shocked. The only
men who have no illusions about
war are those who have recently
been there, and, of course, Mr.
Shaw, who has no illusions
about anything.

THRILLING
PLAY

Thrills! If you want thrills
you must not miss this play
You will be thrilled but not in
the usual way. There are not
any daredevil stunts but the
suspense offered in this play
will make you hold your
breath. You will gasp at the
way the delicate moments are
handled.

This play. is one of those few
which embody many kinds of
writing. It is a militaristic
story, a love story, full of
humor, thrills and dramatical
scenes. It is a deliciously sub-
tle comedy. A satirical, unconr
ventional story which only a
Shaw can handle

Can you imagine a perfectly
moral play opening in a young
lady’s bedroom in which the
young lady is about to retire?
Bernard Shaw is one of the few
authors who can handle such a
situation without producing an
immoral scene. Such a. scene
should make a play that is dif-
ferent, and it does. We have a
story with a love plot but it is
original and pleasing.
