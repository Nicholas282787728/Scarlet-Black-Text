the spotlight for this week’s Jock’s Can
Talk. Hocst took top honors in the
loom butterﬂy and ﬁnished second in
the 200m butterfly at lastwcck’s con—
ference championships. Besides be»

sance man and joack ofall trades.

Scarlet and Blaclc Hello; Justin,
Can you start out by giving us a link
bit ofyour backgtound?

Justin: I’m from Menasha, \X/is. I
started competitive swimming when
I was in third grade—but I took les-
sons when I was really little. I started
at theYMCA and [continued] in high
school. Iwanted to keep on doing that
(swimming) in college ifI could. Thats
one of the reasons I decided to start
looking at small, Division III
schoolsisome place where I could
balance academics and other stuff with
adiletics. .

Iwas racing my dad ina hotel pool
once and beat him when iwas eight,
so he decided to start me swimming
competitively.

5&3: How did you decide on

_ Grinnell?

Justin: I was looking at a lot of
similar schools to Grinnell, but I had
a wonderful visit. I met Erin Hurley,
thc coachicoach oirhe year this year
in the Midwest Conference, and she
deserves it. I think a lot orpeoplc are
sold on the school when they meet her.
I liked Crinnell for some oflts ideals.
Ifyou look back at its history, there's a
lot ofstuffwith social Justice and pro-
r'csring the Vietnam War. The school
kind ofstands for something.

SBLE: How did your season go
this year?

Justin: It was a really good season,
We knew at the beginning of the year
once we saw some or the times the
freshmen were swimming that we were

going to have a lot better team. We
are much stronger, even though the
men’s team dropped down a place in
conference; we're deﬁnitely a much
better team.

I‘m a backstroker on the team, so
Iwas doing that all season. Iwas pretty
impressed with my times. I've deﬁ.
nitely improved since I’ve gotten to
college. The conference meet topped
it all off; it was really exciting. I got
first place in die 100 backstroke and
second in the 200 backstroke and
school records in both ofthose, And I
had some good relay swims with my
teammates.

5&3: What is next season look-
inglike?

Justin: Actually, I’m going abroad
for a semester, but I'll be back for the
second halfofthe season. I’m looking
forward to that. We‘re not really los.
ing anybody.

And of course, I can't forget to
mention the women's teamiconfer—
cncc championships this year. It was
awesome. That's one or the things I
really like about the program here at
Grinnell is the camaraderie between
the two teams. I think it really adds a
special clement. All through high
school it was just single sex, Here we
have a coed team; it’s a lot more fun,
It’s a big team_5o, 60 people—and
it kind ofbecomes like a social group,
especially during our Florida trip. We
have a great time together,

SBtB: You said you’re going
abroad next semestera Do you know
what you’re going to be doing yet?

Justin: Yeah, I’m going to go to
Berlin, Germany, in the fall. I’ll prob-
ably be studying political science and
history. I‘m really interested in the stuﬂr
that's going on in the former Eastern
Bloc right now. Since I’m in Berlin,
that’s a good point to maybe take some
trips into those countries and scc the
changes even within Germany. It’s a
big historical change happening right
now and I’ll be able to see that first

“Can I get something to drink be»

fore we start?"

“Sure."

“You want anything?"

Right away, mree point ace and Jeff
Clement puts me at ease. He's used
to doing this, used to being on the
spot.

I shouldn't be nervous. Wc go to
the same school and have been to the
same patties. But, still, it’s a little
nctveatacking to sit and interview
someone who has scored 77 points in
a game, and broken the NCAA Divi-
sion III 'thtcc-point record three times.
Not to mention, the all-time leading
scorer in Grinnell’s basketball history.

It’s ironic that Clement didn’t even
originally plan on playing basketball
in college. His father played baseball
in the New York Mct's organization,
and Clement had planned to walk on
at thc University of Iowa.

“Actually,” he says with a smile,
“basketball wasn't my best sport com.
ing out ofhighschool. Coach A cn-
riccd me to come here."

How exactly did Men's Head Bas-
ketball Coach DavidArsen'eaulr entice
Clement? He wouldn’t say, “but he
didn’t promise me buckets orpoinrs, I
was interested, cvcn though I didn’t
think I‘d come hete and be the next
scorer. I thought I’d be the guy pass-
ing the ball to the next scorer."

Which makes sense. A prototypi-

/

hand. And I hear Berlins quite a crazy
party town.

53ch When you’re not swim-
ming, what do you like to do here?

Justin: It’s kind of hard, the season
just ﬁnished. swimming is about all i
was doing. I play club rugby and wa.
ter polo in the offcseason. I like Spend»
ing time with my friends. I play the
viola; I’m in a string quartet this se-
mcsrct_that's a lot offun. I like go-
ing to talks and concerts that are on
campus.

5&3: What’s your major?

Justin: I’m a history major. Just den
clared a couple weeks ago.

SELB: How did you get interested
in history?

Justin: I don’t know. It’s just one
of those things I’ve always been inter-
estcd in. I didn't think about it that
muclli it‘s just a natural path I took.
But I like to take classes all over the
place, This semester I have two math
and science classes. That’s the other
thingl like about Crinncll is being able
to have a diverse program like that. I
love the (history) professors: they’re
some of the best people on campus. I
Just like reading history.

sacs: That’s all I have for you, Is
there anything else you want to add?

Justin: Once again, Iwant to thank
Erin Hurley, our coach. She does a
good job of keeping people excited
about swimming because ofhet atti-
tude. She's real laid back and hilari-
ous—always telling us crazy stories.
And (thank) our assistant coach Jim
Randall

And once again to congratulate the
women’s team on winning confer.
enco—thc first time since ’94. It was
cool because both teams were pre-
dictcd third by the coaches in the con-
ferencc and they were able to move up
to first and show everybody It was a
really cool feeling. It shows the close-
ness of the team that we got wrapped
up in that too and could celebrate with
them. They deserve the credit.

teammates before scoring, He aver»

and 13 points a game his senior year

How did this quiet point guard
turn into the leading scorer in Grin-
nell history? “Hard work. That, and
I decided I wanted to score. It was a
change in mentality.“

Clement’s pointsrpetvgamc shot up
berwcen his sophomore, during which
he says he experienced “growing
pains," and juniotyeat, from 25.6 ppg
to 33.4 ppg. He had the nation in
scoring that year, as he did this year.
The difference between those two
years was his work in the oitseason.

Clement grew up in Crinncll, on
a farm‘about three miles outside of
town and grew up playing baseball,
basketball, and football with his
younger brothers.

Being from the town or Cnnnell
has raised the number of supporters
at basketball games signiﬁcantly. The
gym was packed to full capacity last
Saturday for his last game, with people
standing in the doorway and sitting
on the floor. “The support feels great.
To see that side filled and the other
side ﬁlled with students, it’s just. I . I
love to see that."

Ctitlclzc Clement, who never trash
talks (except once to a kid from Lake
Forest) and can't dunk, for not being
as good a player as his stats indicate.

First off, the system works well. If
the team ran a normal game, Clemr
cnr says, “We’d get schooled big time.
if we had fifteen guys that were ail-l-
lctcs the caliber of Ripon or st.
Norbert, I think what we would do to
other teams would be thenomenal.”

Secondly, Clement has contacts to
play profcssional basketball, which
very few Division III players can boast
of. He's looking to play in either En-
gland, Ausrraiia or Greece. Ifnot, he
has “a girlfriend ar UVA law school
who’s not so happy about me living
overseas, so I’ll probably get a job in
the Charlottesvillc area."

Despite the fact that he has plans
for the future, leaving Grinnell Is bir—

Last Saturday Jeff Clement, a se-
nior guard for the crinnell College
Pioneers, put the ﬁnal touches on an
outstanding carecrwhen he scored 41
points in a 10493 win over Lake Fora
ESLFlHlngly, Clement eclipsed the all-
time Grinnell scoring record held by
steve Dickmann early in the second
halfwith a three-pointer. He finished
his career with 2229 points, II more
than the old mark,

" Jeff responded exceptionally well
to the pressures that were placed-on
him. It’s always a difﬁcult thing to per.
form at a high level when everyonc’s
eyes are riveted to your every move,"
commented Coach David Arseneault.

In his ﬁnal game Clement scored
his team's ﬁrst nine points, Hc netted
23 points In the ﬁrst half, leaving him
seven shy of the record. The sharp-
shooter hit a nifty layup and a three»
pointer early in the second half,

Sophomore forward Mike

Clement's heir apparent, Woody
Piirto, scored I7 points on ﬁve three:

skarning racked up 10 assists, scored

'clght points and grabbed rout steals.
Jason Anderson added four assists and
ﬁve steals.

With the victory over Lake Forest,
the Pioneers cvencd their overall
record at I I»! I. By winning rhrce out
of the last four games, Grinncll ﬁn-
ished 7.9 and placed seventh In the
loateam league.

“Its too bad we missed several good
opportunities to beat the teams ahead

ished 15-7,“ offered Arscncaulr.

by nipping the Pioneers, 9897, in

and pushed the lead to 25 points be-
fore Crinncll staged a furious come-
back.

"We had our chances to win in
both regulation and overtime bur we
just didn't ﬁnish them off," explained
Arseneault. “A loss like that really hurts
after coming back from down 25."

Hochman led all scorers with 34

Trock's focus on .MWC meei‘

With only two weeks remaining
until the Midwest Conference cham»
pionships, the Grinnell College
women's track team was glad to get
one more good meet up its sleeve to
provide the runners with some com»
petitivc sced times.

The Pioneers closed out their regu-
lar—season competition against a large
field at the Knox Invitational last Sat-
urday. "Itms a good meet for us. We
had some good competition and we
got to see some more of our confer-
ence opponents," said Coach Evelyn
Freeman.

Idelle Cooper continued to per»
form well, getting a new personal
record in the long jump at 15‘1“ and
tying her pole vault record of seven feet

currently, Cooper and Tammy
Baker are ranked third in the confer
cncc in the pole vault, only six inches
behind the rop.rankcd vaulrer.

Junior Juliana Seraﬁni placed
fourth in the I500 with a time of
5:03.03. That time is good enough to
rank her fourth in the conference. In
the same event sarah Baker dropped
her time substantially to 315139,

In the 3000 Alison Nair dropped
two seconds ofrhcr rimc and clockcd
in at 11:18.29, placing sixth. The
sprint medley team, which consisted
of Melanie Schettlcr, Cooper, sky
bangs, and Nicole Cueno, placed
third, while Schcttler turned in a 200—
meter time of28,l9, ranking hetsixth
in the conference.

While the team usually relies on
its distance crew to provide the bulk
or its victories, last weekend's mccr
proved to be a success all around for
the Pioneers. “We're ﬁnally starting to
get paybacks from the training,“ com-
mented Freeman. The team will use
the next rwo weeks to get healthy, can»
ditionanylingcring injuries, and Con—
tinue the training in preparation for
the conference mect.

Freeman is unsure of her team‘s
position heading into the meet, and
will wair to see the new rankings after
last weekend's results are tallied. "You
want to say thatwe'll keep improving
over the next two weeks, bur then
again everyone else will too. We'll inst
have to see," she concluded.

awaits the Grinncll College track team.
