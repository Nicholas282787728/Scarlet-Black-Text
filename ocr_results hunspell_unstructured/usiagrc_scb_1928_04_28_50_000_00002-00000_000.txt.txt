STEIIEAVT CRITICISM.

The article hour the New Student printed in \vcdnes

day SCARLET AND BLACK is, no doubt, creating a

_ iuror in many colleges or the country. Certainly it is in

Grinncll. Thdt a group, representing thinking student

bodies keenly interested in the Nicaraguan problem,

should be treated with such n combination of scorn and
condescension seems unthinkable.

' It undergraduates have no right to thiiilr to meddle
in foreign aitaii-s as the president's secretary is reported
to have said, who has? It we are not expected to road,
form opinions, and attempt to makesorneuse or these
conclusions, what type of students would they wish us to
be? And what kind or citizens do they expectus to make?

“[2 think that interest in world problems shown by
college and university students is one of the most cars
tain signs oi the value of such institutions. That there
is developing a group who, whether their ideas are of
value or not, are suiiicicntly informed and active to have

' that the s uaticii here is more and more pitilnl.

ioi-lnulzltcd a thice-idld policy, scriiis in us commends
able,
And tllcsc thrcc objectives are or valuc. They show
cool thinking ililtl nlulcrstandlng. They ask [or nothing
more than the best thinkers of the country, whose opillr
ions are rcspcctcd it not accepted, are demanding. [l is
evident that: this student colniniitcc has ondiuilicd the
[acts and ltuows the three ni'ost important stcps in set
{ling the Nicaraguan question. That they should have

been treated as they were is most regrettable.

pliLillg threatens to become one ot the mo. popliinr oi
the spouts. w hal, our courts and equipment it any-
thiiig lidvo deteriorated, rather than licpl pace with en»
lnrged demand.

For the men we lune tonr‘courts, exposed to the
wind train all directions, surrounded by a tence through
which even bc u might escape at ltlmost any point.
The courts are. sandy, rolling, and poor market]. The
problem oi nets has worried more than one insigniiicnnt
beginner. But the woe or all woes is the scarcity oi
courts, themselves. Only tom-ill one is fortunate enough
to rind all oi' thcmnottcd and markcdiiu'e available
tor the use or as many as thirty or iorti people, all (127
sll'illg to pill) .it the some time.

The itnatiou may not be quite so dcploi-alilc on the
women s courts, tor in the main they seem to be in better-
shape than the men's. However, the women, too, distinct
ly need more courts, for with the increase in popularity
oi the grime tour courts are insuliicicnt to supply the
demand.

varsity tcniii is developing at Gi-iiincli into n. vcry at-
tractive sport. But how many like to circumnavigate the
courts, and maintain a standing position throughout the
two or three hours oi the matches? For the mutual
advantage oi players and observers it stand should be
constructed facing n group oi new courts, to be used for
varsity tennis mdtche

To be more speciiic, we advocate a program calling
for the construction or at least tour more tennis courts,
laced with an absel‘vers' stand. (Here we might also
suggest that a judge's seat be provided which is iiior
substantial than a dryrgods box mounted upon a time
table.) Nets should he available at all times tor all at
the courts. A new i-nll,ot fencing should be purchased
and used‘ to close the yawning gaps which at present are
the inspiration [or many an unnecessiiry excoriation or
the “powers then be.”

Tennis is ddmlttedly’hnd properly a popular game.
Griunell owes it to herself and her students to adopt a
policy tor the improvement oi tennis iaci ties.
