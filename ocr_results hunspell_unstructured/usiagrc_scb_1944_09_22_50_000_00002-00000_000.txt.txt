"Come Ye Back" - -

For ‘the past two September‘s students
have returned‘to Grinnell’s campus expect-
ing to have to readjust themselves to the
many and frequently disappointing changes
brought about by the war. The absence of
red—sweatered Honor “G" brawn prepping
freshmen men on the library steps first
made us Grinnell-traditioneis-walling—con—
scious. Then the dorms were closed to civil-
ian use. No more Friday night open house.
Nightly farewells were sung ‘n the dining
room as the remaining civilian men left
.sineg and in‘groups.

In the fall of ‘43, the army took posses-
sion of Read. The blue stars on the service
flag grew more numerous. The gold stars
made us wonder, “Is it worthwhile 7” A, R.
H and the White House were known to the
majority of students only as a name.lnter-
collegiate sports were definitely a figure of
Grinnell’s past. Yet, all of us know that no
matter how many or how drastic the
changes, we would have it no other way.
We are proud to have made this our part.

This fall, -for the first time since the
war began, most of the changes we find
give us hopeful expectation that Grinnell
will one day again be the traditional Grin-
nell that this year‘s seniors knew as fresh»
men. Though few as yet, the returning war
veterans are a most welcome sight. We‘re
glad you‘re here. Throughout the year, as
more of you return, we hope you’ll be
pleased with our attempt to keep the core
of Grinnell intact while changing outward
appearances to fit our needs.

This year’s freshmen have already im-

 

pressed us with their number. One has‘
only to glance at the array of red caps
filling almost half 01' the dining room at
noon to realize that a great many things
may be expected from the class of ’48.
Because you will be vital in keeping Grinnell,
for others to return to, we add to our wel—l
come, “We need every one of you.”

The most difficult of all campus jobs
has been given to the new faculty members
who have come to fill the places of some
of our bestrliked instructors. Frankly, we
didn’t think you could do it, but you’ve‘
scored a hit with us both in class and as a,
campus friend. If you‘re as happy to bet
here as we are to have you, no better be-
ginning fol‘ a successful year is needed.

The Bookworm Turns - -

Among the many innovations which re»
turning students found on the campus this‘
fall was a newly decorated and smoothly
functioning bookstore. It opens every morn-
ing on the dot, and as we crowd in we find
the mail distributed, the businesslike book»
keeping system methodically notillg our ex
penditures, and a general atmosphere of
efficiency permeating the air. We can sin-
cerely commend the new management on
the job that is being done, but we regret[
the change.

The book store has long been the heart
of college life . . . a before-class gathering
place, a convenient on—campus spot in which
to buy our classroom necessities. Not the
least of its attractions was its student man—
agement. We liked buying our supplies
from our friends, knowing that the profit,
helped to pay their college expenses. We
liked the informality and did not feel that
efficiency wassacrificed to achieve it,

Now another realm of student enter-
prise is gone. There is little left for the
student outside of college employment . . .
a fine institution to be sure, but admittedly
one making little allowance for any busi-
ness ability which a person may possess.

A great deal of emphasis has been placed
on “keeping Grinnell alive for the boys."
How about the boys who worked in the
bookstore, who had an eye on the manager-
ship for their senior year? We think that
they may be a little disappointed to find
the book store merely another college office.

We do not advocate that Grinnell stand
still. The entire world is changing too rap-
idly, the danger of stagnation is too great.
But we hope that wartime life has not com—
pletely deprived us of initiative. We would
like to keep, on as small a proving ground
as a college, campus, a studentrborn project
with a definite carry-over value to the busi»
ness world.
