nell's Pitcbcrs strong.

Two more games at the Grins
nelerAvcnport series have been
played off since the last issue of
SCARLET AND BLACK, both going
to the Leaguers, The play in
each has shown more speed than
was displayed in Tuesday’s ex.
hibition, and the good results of
the practice will undoubtedly be
seen in the later games. Milder
weather has also swelled the attcn
dance and assured the success of
the series trom a ﬁnancial point
of view. One noticeable and ex
tremely gratifying icature of the
week has been the strength dis
played by the varsity at the bat,
not in years has such general
sticking been observed in pracr
tice work, and there is every rea
son tor hope oi a successlul sear
son. With the inﬁeld strengthr
erred as seems probable, Grinnell
should put upon the diamond as
fast. and certainly a more even
nine than has represented it for
years. The pitching staff is even
stronger than tliatoflast year and
will undoubtly give a good ac
count of itself before the season’s
close.

\Vcdnesday’sgame proved the
closest of the series and was lost
purely through thc errors of the
locals. lnilic ﬁrst inning Ben-
son walked, was advanced to sec-
ond by Weisbiod’s neat sacrifice,
Schilling secured a single, and
Swalm brought in the two men
upon bases by‘a two bagger over
the center ﬁeld, Willett now
made his debut by putting the
spere tar. far out over the cinders
in lett ﬁeld and took an easy
Jaunt around the circuit in the
ﬁrst home run oi the year. With
thislcztd at four points Gi‘innell
seemed to hold a commanding
position and kept the Leagtrers
well in hand until the sixth
ing. Here thé varsity lost its
head and tour errors in rapid suc-
cession allowed as many iuns and
gave Davenport a lead that could
not be overcome. The game
ended, Grnnell 7, Davenport o.
Swalm’s work in the box in this
game deserves special commend-
ation.

Reports oi the previous day's
game and perfect weather attracb
ed on Thursday afternoon the

largest crowd of the week. The
diamond had been treslrly scraped
and conditions favored the fastest
game of the series. Grinnell was
weakened by the loss of Wilder
and an injury to B. Benson which
necessitated an exchange of posi»
lions with his brother. Weisbrod
went into the box for Grinnell and
Hughes, the strongest man upon
their staff, ofﬁctated for Davcn»
