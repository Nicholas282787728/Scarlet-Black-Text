Cooper Legend Still Discussed Today

By Riva Sharples

GRINNELLIANS who at

tended last week‘s Show
ing oleic Weslerncr had a
chance 10 see a famous Grinnell
alumni in action. In his one yC‘dI tit
Grinncll College, movie star Gary
Cooper or “Cowboy Cooper," as he
was popularly known at Grinncll
became one of the most popular mcn
oncnrnpus,gettingintoalotol'lrouble
while doing ll.

Even today, most Grinnell stu-
dents hear the legendary Iale about
the student who took a cow to the top
ofGates Tower, and then was unable
to get the animal down. As the Story
goes, the animal was finally slaugh-
tered(theonly meansofremovingit)
and the adventuresome student was

expelled. Although the incident (in
parently did not happen. the mytlt
was created during Cooper’s time at
Grinncll, and based on several inci-
dents he had with a horse on campus.

Cooper was born in Helena,
Montana, on May 7, 1901. The son
ofa rancher, Cooper rode horses and
”lived in thewrld \vcsl,"tiiitilcoming
to Grinnell in 1922.

At dial time, Grinnell College
had approximately SOOmale students
and 300 female students, The town
was small. wtth about 4,000 perma»
nent year-round residans, and was
described as a “farming community
of modest prosperity."

Coopcrlivedon thesecond floor
of Langan Hall and was considered
unusual because he came “all the
way from Montana." Most
Grinnellians at that time came from

small towns surrounding Grinrtcll.
International students were virtually
nonexistent.

For part of his year at Grinllell.
Cooper worked at the popular gather-
ing spot for students, the Powoslilck
Cafe. He also htid ajob picking and
pressulg apples for sweet Cider for a
Grinncll professor named Tullock.
Using knowledge gained from the use
of Tatlock's presses, Cooper and a
chemist friend made their own press
anddixtnbutcdtilcohol.dcspitcrts pro-
hibition. When they werediscovorcd.
the college “firmly reprininnttotl the
boys,” but did not throw them out.
Cooper and another lnontl then went
on to manufacture bathtub gin.

Cooper was busy during his year
at Grinnell. He took both Greek and
Spanish during his first scmcstcr,but
enjoyed his drzlwrng class the most.

He was Arts Editor of the ycarbor
and lost by one vote the title of“wi
terswecthcart,” Coopcrcnyoycdzi
work. and did several cartoons
ctlinpiislife for the Scarlciand Blur;
He was ‘4 member of the literary f
lmvship. tlic Ctircstomnthm Lil. b
was rejected direc times from tI
Club to which he rctilly wanted
belong, the drama society,

Cooper left Grinncll College
Mtly of 1923 with every intention
returning. He did come back lor t|
Fall 1923 semester, but meInCltIl d
flcultics forced him to leave. i
went to Montana for several mont
in hopes of saving up money to go
art school in Chicago. Instead,
moved to Los Angeles with his fat
ily and became involved in IJIC mo
it's. And the rest as they say
history.

Chenette's ”Soul" Has Something For Everyone

IN less than one week. a musical

Mr. Chcncttc started teaching
music at Grinncll about eleven years
ago, and now tcaches music compost
Lion and theory. He started composing
in 1985, which is wllcn he began work
on his opera. Almouglt he has written
seveial orchestral pieces over the ptist
eight years, the upcoming opera has
been his mam project.

This opera, based on a story of

the same name by Willa Cather. is
somewhat of a departure from what
mosl of us lhmk of when we hear the
word “opera." Unlike most sunilar
works, it is entirely in English, with
lots of dancing and themes that most
can relate to. It is a lively, energetic
story about a Norwegian immigrant
named Eric, whose love for life best
shows when he is playing his violin,
