human-Cuban Pact ls lypltal
0f Early Soviet Mtg In China '

by Steve Vatner l

Saturday, Feb. 13, the Ru iii
Foreign Minister, Anastas Mlkor
yan, and Cuba’s Premier Fidel
Castro consummated an agreee
mcnt oi vital signiﬁcance to the
United States. The Soviet Union
agreed to purchase 5 million
tons of Cuban sugar over a ﬁver
year period at the world market
price. Furthermore, Russia ex-
tended Cuba's credit of $100
million repayablc at an interest
rate oi two and alieelialf per»
cent over a period oi 12 years,
Approximately ionr-titths oi thci
sugar will be exchanged tor So—
viet exports, especially machine
cry and technical aid.

One of the inost«pei-tlnentl
problems that comes to the iore‘
is the possibility that Cuba may
secure Russian-built tighter
planes. it has been the policy
of both the United States and
Great Britain to deny Cuba's
wish for Jet aircraft on the bar
sis that if Castro does obtain
them, peace in the Caribbean
will not be lasting, So far Mi-
koyan‘ has denied even discuss-V
irig this subject with Castro, buLl
it is patent that this is a pri-‘
may interest at Cuba's premier,
and the possibility exists that it‘
may be fulﬁlled. )

According to a statement is- l
sued that weekend, relations
between Cuba and the Soviet
Union will be cultivated in
the areas oi economics, tech—
nology and culture. More she»
ciﬁcally, it was stated that
Cuba and the Soviet Union
would strive in the same
cause lor international peace,

Generally, what this means is
that ‘Russia will have greater
opportunity to involve lrerscli
in the chairs of the Caribbean
and South America. This would
facilitate more intense Soviet in-
iiltratien and would provide for
a less secure “back yard" tor
the United States.

More specifically, what is in-
herent in these statements is
the possible deterioration oi the
American bloc in the United
Nations. it would surely be a
mayor victory tor the U.S.S.R.
it this bloc could be broken and
the United States should 1052'
its dominant position in the UN.

Although Castro claims that l
Cuba wishes to be tree irom
either capitalism or commu-
nism, it is evident that thc
trend oi his government is
toward the latter, accompa—
nied by a developing reaction
against the iormer.

Castro is alienating the lniddl
Class, once supporters of his
revolution, with increasingly
more sociallstlc measures and
the coniii‘iued breakdown oi
Cuba's capitalistic system.

His trcouent attacks on the
United States and the desire or
some Cubans to expi'opi rate U S,,
interests in Cuba do little tol
cement u S,aCuban relational
This recent merger with Russia
may merely be an indication oi
Castro’s independent will, but it
seems to support Cuba‘s trcnd
away from capitalism,

The reaction at Cuba's larg—
est ncwspaper, “Diariu tie in
Marin,” to the Kussinanuhun
agreement is the one hopciul
aspect in the whole situation.
In two editorials, "Commu-
nism; Why?“ and “Thanks,
Senor Mikoynn," the paper-
expressed its abhorrencc OI
Communism and its dread oi
Soviet inﬁltration in South
America. it this sentiment is
characteristic iri Cuba, the ima
portance ot- the Russian sugar
purchase is minimized to a
great extent.

However, the of

this agreement cannot be mini-
mized on account oi a certain
coincidence, This pact was Signr

1950, a 30-year treaty of friend-

ship, alliance and mutual aid
was signed by the USS R. and
the Chinese People's Republic.

The similarity between the,
two pacts is striking. Both were
extremely proﬁtable tor .the So
vict Union diplomatically and
economically, in the Sine—Soviet
treaty Russia agreed to extend
$300 million credit to China
over a fivesyezlr period. which
would be repaid by China with

purchase oi Russian machinery,

The meaning of this treaty
was virtual dominance by tin

As a sidelight,
mentioned that both pacts were
not at all economically unfavorr

loans, not gifts, were extended,
and were to be repaid in part
by the purchase oi Soviet exe

stering home industry and the
general economy.

Secondly, it is interesting to
note that Russia, in paying Cu-
ba tor sugar at the world mar»
ket price of three cents per
pound, is paying merely 2%
cents per pound less than the,
United States. One doesn't have‘
to be a mathematician to real»
ice the tremendous differential
in cost over shipments ot twol
and three hundred thousand
tons.

The conclusion seems to be i
that through an aggressive,
dynamic foreign policy the
Soviet Union is enectiirg enorr
