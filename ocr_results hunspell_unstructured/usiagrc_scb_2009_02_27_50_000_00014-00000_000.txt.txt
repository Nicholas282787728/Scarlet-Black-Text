itvjnt Gmtc

With a new head coach, new assistant coach,
the loss of six players due to graduation, and sew
eral injuries, the women's softball team will have a
lot to contend \m‘rh this season.

Last year the team went 3-5 in MWC play,
but matching last season’s record may be a chal
lenge fot the team as most of the starters inll nor
be returning. ‘

“A lot of those girls we lost wcrc starters, so
it's just going to be dirrerent this year man it was
before," said Co-Captain Tess Cohen '09. “A lot
ot’people are stepping into new positions,”

Aside from the changes on the ﬁeld, of? the
ﬁeld the coaching stall is brand new. The new
coach, Sandra Faulkner. currently a coach at
Grinneu Community Senior High School, was
hired less than aweek ago.

“Softball is still sot’tball,"l-‘aulkner said.“But at
the college level you are trying to ﬁne tune every
thing so you can perform at the higher level,"

Despite being at rlrc helm for such a short
time, the coach said she believes that the team has
been well prepared tot this season.

“The assistant coach [Kate Gluckmin, the
head women's basketball coach] and the volunteer
coach [Craig Arondr] have done a ﬁne job ofprc-
paring them to be at the level they need to be at,"
Faulkner said. “So I do not feel like the team lost
anything from me not being there at the begin—
mn .

gFrom what the team has erpericnced so tar,
they are very excited to play for Coach Faulkner.

“She’s fantastic, we are really excited with the

MlCllELLE FoultNlElt

energy and expertise she brings to the game," said
ccrcuptain Darcy \Naid ’09 ”Front the ﬁrst moe
.ntat we met her, we were conﬁdent in her ability
to lead us.

In addition to the new coach, the team has
had to contend with numerous injuries that have
seriously constricted the team's options.

“We will have to try and till the positions the
best that we can," Faulkner said. “\Ve may have
to have plnyets maybe play positions they are not
used to so they may be outside their comfort zone
a little bit."

The team cuncntly practices in the PEG bce
cause of tho wintery lowa weather, which prcvcnrs
them doing many things they could do outside,
arch as hit ﬂy balls.

“Right now we have six weeks indoors, that's
when moral: is the lowest,"VVatd said. “We have
managed to be excited, stay focused, and get in
shape. Once we start to play terms it will got more
fun.

The team will begin their season by going to
California to {ace sortie tough competition, in-
cluding milked teams. .

“We have a pretty challenging schedule in
Califomia,"Cohcn said,“l think it will be good to
play against teams that are that good because we
will have to push ourselves early on."

Despite all the team has to contend with, the
coach is optimistic of what they can achieve.

"After a couple pracriecs underneath ray bell,
the girls they come in and work hard," Faulkner
said “They havc done ercrything l have asked
them to do, they are focused and determined."

Baseball hits the field

in' CHLOE MORYL

The end of the basketball season means
one thing: the baseball tcam is forced to trade
in their beer-estein hats and rhyming chants for
tight pants and metal spikes,

Though this past Wednesday was one of
the first days the weather has permit-ted outc
door play, the baseball team has been practicing
daily since Feb 1 in thc PEC, preparing for the
upcoming season.

“Practicing indoors on that PEC flool
doesn’t cornparc to cut grass
in real games."said pitchcr
Gary Kahn '0‘), “But we're
out there, always working
haid."

Kuhn will be rctutnr
ing to the mound this scuson,j0llicd by fellow
senior Rick Bordello '09, and juniors Marshall
Chavez’lO, Chad Chlistoff'lO, Ryan l‘lal‘i’ls '10
and Brian Sollo ’10.Also coming to the mound
will be fln’f’yCilYS. And lots of them.

With a huge hrsteycar class or 12 players.
which amounts to over a third of the team, the
Pioneers said they look forward to signiﬁcant
increases in the number of pitchers and cute
fieldels available. “Coach really needed to [6*
load players for the next four years," l<ahn said,
“We’ve got a really talented group of first years.
they'll be stepping up and making an impact
right avlmy.”

Despite having a large roster, Jason l<ernis
’12,outﬁeld. said that the team remains really

M
will each other and rea/ly dose” hard work to user as may

cohesive. “The upperelassrnen made everybody
feel involved." Kemis said. “We're all really
comfortable with caclt other and really close, it's
something that I definitely didn't have before in
high school."

As a result of this cohesion, the Pioneers CK-
pect this season to be full oi’success. “Our ﬁrst
gail to win coniercncc and-l fccl pretty good
about that," K s said. “The upperclassrncn
say it's looking Ii . a strong team, so everybody
has high etpectations."

The Pioneers will be
ablc to put their preseason

travel to play their lirst
game at the Menodome
in Minneapolis. “lt’s reauy
nice to get one game in bcforc we go play (lure
ing spring break in Florida," Kahrt said. “And
it’s cool to play on a major league ﬁeld."

Even though the players express excitement
about playing on a major league field. they’re
more excited to face competition in a game
situation. “I could really care less about where
it is," Kernis said. “Everybody is just sick of all
practice and no games It‘s going to be great to
actually play,"

Lucky for the Pioneetsi their ﬁrst game is
only days away They head to the Mettodomc
for a doubleheader against Carleton on Mon-
day, March 2. They then head to Florida on
March 15,befote returning to Grinnell for their
