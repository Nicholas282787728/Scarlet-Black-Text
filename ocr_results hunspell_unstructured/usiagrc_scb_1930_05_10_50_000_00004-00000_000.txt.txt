Grinnell Whips
Missouri 6 to 0
in Tennis Fray

Only One of Six Matches
Extends to Full Limit
of Three Sets.

Pioneer‘s’ First Win

Gharles DeLong Replaces Allen
in Number Four Singles;
Jones Wins, 6-2, 6-0.

The Drake-tirinncu teiuiis
match, which was scheduled to
he played on the local courts this
afternoon, has been postponed on
account of min and will take
place Monday afternoon at three
oclock.

Crinnell tennis players tasted vic-
tory for the first time this season by
trouncing the racquet wielders from
the University of Missouri here yes-
terday afternoon, 6 to o. The vi
ors were outclassed in every match
and only in the fourth singles was a
Crinnell man extended to more than
two sets. This is the second time
that a Pioneer net team has defeated
the Tigers this season, Jones and
Kent having won a 3-0 affair during
the spring recess.

Pioneer Captain Wins

Capt. Don Jones swept aside the
Missouri ace, Johnson, with his ac-
curate baseline drives and a decided-
ly improved service. Johnson did
put in an occasional good stroke. but
he was too erratic to give Jones
much competition. Lingle. playing
number two man for Missouri, seem-
ed unable to control his stroking the
first set and Kent won, 6-2. In the
second set the Tiger netster played
a more effective style of tennis to
force the Pioneer wielder to a 10-8
count in games before ﬁnally captur-
ing the set and match.

Thielieke proved no match for
Robert DeLong. losing. 6-2. 6-4. De-
Long’s driving and lobbi g was
much more accurate in h s match
yesterday than it has been so far
this season. Charles DeLong. re-
placing Allen in fourth singles, had
the only struggle of the meet when
he lost the ﬁrst set to Phelps of
Missouri. He staged a timely come-
back to outwit his opponent in the
next two sets, 6-4. 6-1.

Net Play Features

The brilliant net play and team-
work of the Pioneer ﬁrst doubles
team scored an easy win over the
Missouri couple, 6-2, 5-4. Jones and
Kent literally smashed their way
through the loose defense of the vis-

ing pair. Robert DeLong and
‘Allen scored their fourth consecutive
doubles win when they destroyed any
‘hopes that Missouri may have enter-
tained of preventing a shut-nut, by
defeating an unimpressive duo of
Johnson and Phelps in straight sets.
Allen's serve was registering quite
regularly and his backhand showed
improvement.

The summary:

Jones, Crinnell, defeated Johnson,
Missouri; 6-2. 6-0.

Kent, Crinnell,
Missouri; 6-2, 10-8.

Robert DeLong, Grinneil, defeated
Thieiieke, Missouri; 6-2. 6-4.

Charles Deng, Grinneil, defeated
Phelps, Missouri; 4-60. 6-4, 6-1.

Jones and Kent, Grinnell, defeated
Lingle and Thielieke, Missouri; 6-2,
6-4.

Robert DeLong and Allen, Crin-
nell. defeated Johnson and Phelps,
Missouri; 6-2, 6—3.

Among the many curiosities to be
found in Wimborne mlnster, in Dar-
set (England), is the quaint tomb 0!
Anthony Etricke, the first recorder of
Poole. He was for some reason 0!-
fendcd by the Wlmbornc people. and
so made a vow that he would not be
buried in their church or out, under
the ground or over. To carry this out
he cut a niche in the wall and placed
there his comn with the date 1693 in-
dcribed thereon, believing that he
Should die in that year. He did not
die, however, until 1703, when he was
buried in the chosen spot in such a
way that his body wns neither above
the ground or below, in the church
or out The date 1703 wlls then writ-
ten over the other in gold. He left
$5 a year for the tomb‘l upkeepl
which is Still paid.

Nest of Three Rooms

Required for Stork
A lllree~roomed tenement is bulir by
the hammer-headed stork for the hous-
ing of himself and family. He is a
native of Africa and in his construc-
tion work utilizes enormous sticks
which he lines between the branches
of a tree. Any ordinary boy could
creep into the lowest compartment.
From this a passage slopes up to un-
otter ﬁn! decorated with bright peb-
bles and bleached bones. Above this
is the nursery, the walls of which lire
lined with mud to keep out drafts. A
curious nest is the one the swifLie!
builds in Borneo, and which is known
in commerce as the edible nest of the
Chinese gourmet. The bird builds in
caverns around the coasts, rind nest-
scchcrs go with torches rind tear them
flown and export them. it is shit] ttnr
ruihlo hosts to the value of 51.500900
:ll‘c illlplll’ied into China every yeill’.
The nest is woven from n secretion
the bird produces—hence its food
wine.

Wood Speaks—

on ‘Humanism’

Professor Upholds Theory
of Literature Before
Liberal Club.

“The two chief objections brought,
against Humanism," Prof. Paul
Spencer Wood told the Liberal club
Thursday evening, “are that it is un-
American. and that it is just Plu-
itanism in disguise."

Mr. Wood disposed of the first of
these objections with a Smile and
to the second he remarked, “No-one
seems to know exactlywhata Puri-
tan is anyway, and what one would
look like in disguise is almost im-
possible to determine."

Humanism was explained chiefly
as a theory of literature by Profes-
sor Wood. it believes in reer or
and balance, as opposed to grotesque
developments like Congorism in
Spanish drama and certain features
of contemporary literature. The
speakers analyzed extreme features
of modern literature as the decadence
of the romanticism of the early
nineteenth century, not as the her-
alds of a new golden age of letters.

As a philosophy of life, Human-
ism emphasizes free and ethical
choice. and the Hellenic motto,
“Moderation in all things .. When
asked how free will is justified, Mr.
Wood declared that the opposite had
never been proved, and quoted a
leading humanist to the effect that
whatever one officially believes
about determination, he thinks in his
own mind as if he had free will.

Humanism sets itself squarely
against most of the modern gods,
Mr. Wood asserted. it denies that
our apparent progress has increased
the happiness of mankind. While
using the machine when it is exped-
ient to do so, the humanist mai -
tains that the world would be neith-
er better nor worse off without it.
He thinks the scientist is misled in
pressing forward to new inventions
before we have intellectually master-
ed the ones we have. The humanist
distrusts the test of utilita utiht,

Quail bio of Thin:

Dr. Joseph Grinueii, aruitboiogist, of
California, believes that lack of water
explains the disappearance of qunil in
many parts of that state. He has made
investigations uud finds that nrelis
formerly supplied with water lire now
dry owing to climatic changes and rec-
lamation work and have become un-
inhabited hs nesting grounds hr the
quail.

Doctor Grinnell does not believe
that vermin has accounted for the dis-
appearance o! the birds so much ll!
the lack of water, as the species of
wild birds and animals designated its
vermin also have become scorcer dur-
ing recent years in the slime area.
Young quail. which are hutched more
than 400 yards from water out] where
ruin does not fall or hehvy dews occur
shortly after they are botched will die
from thirst. says a bulletin of the
American Game Protective association
