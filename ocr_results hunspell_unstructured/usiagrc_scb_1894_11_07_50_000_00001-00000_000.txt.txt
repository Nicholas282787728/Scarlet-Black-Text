PROFESSIONALISM

Casper W. Whitney has an \*\r
tended artic ‘in the last [ﬂu-perk
Var/[v on some ol the evils now
threatening football. lle consid-
ers that the game will not be pro-
perly played until slugging is en.
tirely eliminated from the sport.
He suggests that the lincsman be
given seine power, instead of being
one whose opinion is only expressed
when asked lor. He could then
watch for foul plays, and immedi-
ately rule off the otiender, A few
penalties oi that kind would soon
stop that sort of work. Mr. \\'hitr
ney thinks also that too much time
and money is being spent on pre-
limiaary practice. The playing of
intercollegiate games on college
grounds only is strongly advocated.
