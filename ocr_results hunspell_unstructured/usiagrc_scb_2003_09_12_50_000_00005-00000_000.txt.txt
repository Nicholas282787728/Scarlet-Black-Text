The Soul Clinic Ambassadors
Saturday, September id at 7:30 pm. in Sebn'ng-lewis

last Monday, singers from around the world filled a
classroom in Grinnell College's fine arts building to
practice ror an unprecedented concert, rherr voices
intermingled with piano, drums and handclaps. The
sound was thick, unwavering and joyous,

This music resulted from the collaboration of Young
Black and Gifted (VGB), Grinnell's gospel choir, with The
Soul Clinic Ambassadors. This Saturday, VGB will perform
with The Soul Clinic Ambassadors, 2 group of Ghanaian
gospel singers who journeyed trom Ghana to spread
rriendship through their music and prayer.

Alum Joseph Oppong '03, who was part oi the
Ghanaian choir before he enrolled at Grinnell, was
instrumental in the Ambassadors' decision to Come to
Grinnell. ”1 organized this tour to foster an
understanding or the different styles of gospel music
and the way rt impacts the lives or people in difierent
places, This concert should be an excellent way for
students and others to appreciate Ghanaian gospel music
and have an opportunity to experience the joy, power
and peace that comes tron singing gospel music," he
said.

The Soul Clinic Ambassadors is the musical offshoot of
the Soul Clinic International Church, a
nondenominalional church in Ghana. ”Music plays a
central role at the Soul Clinic Church and the
Ambassadors are at the heart of this worship process,”
oppong said. The choir has over forty members,
including lawyers, pharmacists, and is led by director
Ace Antomah. The chorr has performed extensively in
Ghana, and recently launched an album

“For most or us, this is our first time out [of Ghana],
so it’s really an experience for us,” said Emmanuel
Anipa, a member of The Soul Clinic Ambassadors. ”We
are excited about the trip and we are hoping to share
fellowship. Apart from just ministering in music and
pumping the voice or God, we hope to share
fellowship— meet with you, have real life contact one
with another and have some fun as well.”

The Soul (linic Ambassadors set about accomplishing
this goal during the ﬁrst practice yea. William
ojangmah, the director of rhe Soul clinic Ambassadors,
established an immediate rapport with VGB singers, who
responded easily to his suggestions about the songs and
dances. ”We know that God’s word comes alive in all the
different styles of music," said YGB director Barry Jones,
who Spent much of Mondays practice dancing and
smiling encouragingly at the singers.

Members of Grinnell's gospel choir are enthusiastic
about the collabomtionr "1 have never done anything
like this before and I can't wait to see the outcome. I’m
excited," Mahi Demissie ’06 said, ”I never thought we

' would be singing with an international group”

Although the singers come from very,diverse
backgrounds, they are united by music. V68 member
Brandi Green '05 said, ”The music is universal: it makes
you feel good and it also inﬂuences many other genres
of music. Yes, it does have a message but it may apply
to you depending on your belrefs. However, it it doesn't
then people can still clap, sing and dance along to the
musics"

On Saturday: performance, The Soul Clinic
Ambassadors will sing most of the songs and Val! will
join them for two selection; "The chair from Ghana will
provide a new flavor to Gospel music as they sing their
renditions to some of the more popular gospel music
songs by artists iron the United States,” Jones
predicted The VGB student: “are ready to take this choir
to the next level," Jones said, ”All of them love to sing
and express themselves through the music... The energy
level of these students is top notch and I hope to utilize
all of that excitement as we sing our music.” The rich
song and dance combinations or Monday’s practice were
only a taste of what promises to he ”an experience you
will not forget,” Jones said.

Real Women Have Curves (PG~13)

Fun Swedish Fact; Swedes aren'l huge fans ofAmcrican independcnr
ﬁlms about the familial and Socicul sun as ofMexrunrAmerlcan women.

This welblcnown fact is probably why I can't ﬁnd a
copy of Real Womm Hui/e Corner or any video store here,
which in turn explains why the review as follows will be
primarily culled from rhe humor.

The rirular women are Ana, (America Ferrera) a first
generation Maxim-American high school gmduare wirb
ascl‘tolarship to Columbia, and her mother Carmen (Lupe
Onriveros), who would prefer rher her daughter followed
tire family business, woriong in z swelrering sewing ruc—
rory. They clash over Ana's goals, girth and abandonment
ofher family and heritager Director Parricio Cardoso spent
[an years rryrng to make this ﬁlm, and born Elvis Mitchell
and Roger Ebert say its pretty good, so [’1] go along with
them.
