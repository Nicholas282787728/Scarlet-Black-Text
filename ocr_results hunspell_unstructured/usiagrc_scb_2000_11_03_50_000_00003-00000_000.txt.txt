was a group orNcos in Kenya
that funded training for people

in making the government of

“The problem in many Af-

that often the church refuses to

To raise money rot
their organizations, they asked all the studenrs who
had studied abroad in Africa to donate items they had _
brought back. in all they received as items, including

Debating Union wins

two tourna

by Erik Gable
Staff Writer

The Grinnell college Debating
Union addcd two more impressive
performances to their record over Fall
Break, according to member Gabe
Rosenberg ‘03.

in tournaments at Minnesota
state university and Bethany
Lutheran College, Rosenberg and his
partner, Geoffrey swenson ‘03, com.
peted against schools rrom all over the
upper midwest. They posted a strong
performance, winning both tourna.
merits At Bethany Lutheran,
Grinnell (:amx closed out the come
petition: by the ﬁnal round, no other
seboalswere lettin the running. Mike
Taliercio ’04, and Sherman Willis ’01,
made up the other team that clinched
victory for Grinnell.

Earlier this semester, teams from
the Debating Union traveled to Clll'
forniaforatournamcnt in Clarcmont.
The tournament drew tcan‘is fiom all
over the west coast, including large
state universities lilte UCLA and UC-
Berleeley, both ofwhich were defeated
by the Grinncll debaters.

“We had a lot offun," Rosenberg
said, adding that one of dcbntc’s
uniqueehallengcs is that it sometimes
forces people to argue against their
own beliefs. For example, he said, “I
had to argue against more gun con.
trol.”

other topics debated at the
Claremont tournament, which fols
lowed a round—robin format (each
team debating another in turn), ins
cllldcd energy policy, United states
foreign policy in china, and sending
technology to the former soviet re.
publies.

merits

Grinnell didnt win the tourna.
ment, but was ranked in the top eight
when the debaters had to leave in or—
der to eareh their ﬂight Rosenberg
believes the debaters eould have won
irthey had stayed.

Going as far aﬁeld as Calirornia
is unusual, Rosenberg said. The
Grinncll college team usually drives
to competitions, “which unfortu-
narely limits the number ofdebares
we can attend,"

Rosenberg said that Grinnell's
budget for debate is dramatically
smaller than that or most other
schools, but “we always seem to be
holding our own, and we're proud or
that." ClztemontrMcKenna has a
$60 000 budget rot travel expenses
alone

The ormnell Debating union,
as at as its history or intercollegiate
debate, is unfortunately rather lim-
ited,” Rosenberg said.

Rosenberg argued that allotting
more funds to the debate team would
return tangible beneﬁts to the eollege.
Debaters often find that they have an
edge in lawschool admissions, forex-
ample.

“it’s invaluable," he said. “The
impaet or this cannot be underesti.
mated."

in a nation where publie speakr
ing is a number one test, Rosenberg
added, debate is useful beeause it
teaches eommunrearioa skills.

Finally, Rosenberg described de.
bate as a good way to inetease the
colleges name recognition. its a
wonderful way to get Grinncll’s name
out there," he said. “ittitey don't know
where Grinnell is, they certainly will
after we beat them."
