To Define Humanity Of Christ

by Howard B. Burklc
Acting Dean of the Chapel

In the Gates lectures of 1958, Albert C. Outler, pro-
fessor of historical theology at Southern Methodist univers-
ity, discussed the person of Jesus Christ by analyzing the
creeds of Nicaca and Cllalcedon. This analysis is one of the
fruits of the year which Dr. Outler recently spent in resi-
dence at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,
studying the minutes and accounts of the councils of the
Christian church from the second through the eighth cena

. in terms of tests, drop quizzes, papers and outside reading
has admittedly increased in the past two years As long as this in.
crease is in the realm of actual learning, it is good If it overlaps
into the categories of busy work or discipline, it is a direct refuta-
tion of the belief in independent work and student maturity which
is the basis of much of the college's curricular policy.

Perhaps we, as students, zlre incapable of evaluating what is
busy work and what is not. Perhaps this discrimination can be
made only by minds “older and wiser”——and more educated—than
our own. However, all—night sessions to do last-minute assignments
or to cram for impending drop quizzes are sapping much of the
student strength nnd vitality and hence lessening the amount of
independent thought and inquiry that should be so important in 3
part of the college—in fact, the life—environment.

Earlier this week one of my
.professors chanced to diverge
from his lecture for a momenti
and, in doing so, delivered a
mild condemnation of hunting.

He admitted that he did not
wholly understand the hunters
rationale, and that there might
well be something to the idea
of communion with nature; he
said, though, that he was puz-
zled by the rather paradoxical
reconciliation of pleasure with
killing 1 sympathize with that
gentleman, and grant that it is,
indeed, hard for the non-hunter
to understand. ButI wish he
could have gone out with us on
the opening, last Saturday.

1 hunted with my room-
mate and I biology professor
with whom I have opened
the season for three years;
that (act alone nude the day
pleasurable to anticipate: it
was deﬁnitely traditional, a
hollowed day, and in the
darkest hours of exams and
papers and tribulations it was
well Worth waiting for. By
the time the ﬁnal hours passed
we were all of us jumping up
and down in expectation, like
a trio of bounds straining at
the leash.

There was killing, to be sure:
in six or six and a half hours
of hunting We managed to
beg our birds; the pheasants
were plentiful, and we kicked
up perhaps a dozen of them in
our travels, Our shooting was
ragged, with a stiff wind blow-
ing. and we considered ourselves
luclw to bring home three mos
ters. Thus the hunt, from the
crassest material viewpoint, was
a success. ,

But there was much more
to our opening day than just
the shooting; there was the
golden grandeur of an lowa
fall, the tawny, crackling
oornﬁelds, and the amusing
sight of a party of hunters in
every weedpatch for 20 miles
around. There was the deli-
cious sense of freedom that
makes itself apparent upon
leaving Girinnell temporarily
behind, and the yeoman‘s
lunch packed by the good
professor's wile (sandwichesv
fruit, arid—marvelous thought!
—a quart of V8 juice). All
ﬁlls, combined with the con-
versation and Wﬁrmed by the
mysterious fellowship of the
hunt, made the opener a meme
arable one.

Nor did the hunt quite end
last Saturday: a couple days
later yet another professor and
his wife honored us with an
invitation to dinner, and we
dined heartily on creamed
pheasant, homemade bread, and
a mountainous lemon chiffon pie,
accompanied. again, by conver-

tul’y. ,

Dr. Cutler prefaced the final
lecture by listing the chief poian
of his argument up to that mo-
ment. In view of the abstruse
character of much of the ma
terial, this listing was helpful;
it assembled the stuff of the
first four lectures into ten intel—
lectually manageable units, and
gave us a concise picture of the
movement of the argument.

(1) For the Christian the
fundamental and controlling
datum of his religious reflec-
tion is Jesus Christ 25 'he is
presented in the New Tests-
ment.

(2) in the New Testament
Jesus Christ is presented as a
compound datu the manifes~
trtion of the living God, on the
one hand, and as a real human
being, ”one of our own kind,"
on the other hand.

(a) The affirmation that Jesus
Christ is fully human is the
basic belief which must be kept
"d view whatever else is affirm»
e .

(4) The attempt to describe
Jesus Christ to the Gentile
world raised the question of
his metaphysical status.

(5) The Council of Nicaea
settled the first half of the
metaphysical question by estab-
llshing that Christ is of the same
being as God.‘

(6) The Council of chalcedon
settled the other half of the
metaphysical question 'by estab—
lishing that Christ is fully man,
genuinely “one of our kind."

(7) Orthodox Christianity
has always manifested a ten-

sation that ran from hunting to
football to roses to the new li-
brary. it was a most enjoyable
evening, and a ﬁtting climax to
the preceding weekend. Whether
or not this serves as a declare-l
tion of the principles of hunt.‘
ing, it should, at least, affirm
that there is considerably more
to it than mere killing. In Eng-
land, after all, ”The Twelfth”
is virtually a national holiday!
. . .

I should like to extend to
the housekeeping department
the thanks of the entire sen
stall for putting up spanking
new drapes in our ofﬁce; the
innovation has made the place

considerably more hubitable,’

and it may, in time, even spur
us into cleaning it up . . .
though the contrast of vivid
curtains with rag-tag slovenll-
ness is almost worth preserv-
ing.

If this daysbysday grind is necessary at all, it would be better
integrated into the student schedule if the faculty member would
recognize the fact that not only he but four or fir/Hr even six—-
other professors urc also deciding what disciplines are necessary for
the growing mind. To each professor, his own subieot or field of
interest looms as all-important. Facing facts, this obviously cannot
be the case.

For these reasons, we suggest the following faculty legisla<
tion:

1. As a. corollary to the policy that hour exams be assigned a
week in advance, a rule stating that papers over two thousand.
words in length be assigned at least one week in advance, pre-
ferably two. nd that papers over five hundred words be announc-
ed with at least one class meeting intervening between the assign-
ment and the due date.

2. That quizzes be announced one class meeting in advance
,or be given upon a regular day each week. (Grades should not
depend upon when daily assignments are completed, but upon
the students’ understanding and total absorption. The “dropped"
factor is not necessary in gauging these criteria.

3. Thu! outside reading reports he cumulaﬂve in due dates
rather than falling due one at a time.

4. That semester assignment sheets, including due dates 0!
papers and exams, be recommended in all classes

We fully realize that the chance of the faculty discussing these
proposals is slight. The professors are correct in their contention
that such decisions should be made by each and every faculty
member. This belief. while idealistleally valid, is not practierlly
sound. As long as individual professors refuse to consider the pack-
ed student schedule, the work in all classes will suffer.
