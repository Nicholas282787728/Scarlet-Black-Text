Larix Decidua (European Larch)

I wish I were a tree.

Pine tree, of some sort,
Standing tall- ~

So tall that I can barely see
No I cannot see

the top

Framed within library windows
Frames which try to restrict my tree
And fail (Yesl-eiail) and i laugh

for my tree cannot be contained
(it bulges over into an adjacent window frame
and hides its top above the roof
so that i cannot see

my tree top)

old, old tree
with small brass label
mcked on brown recmngle of wood
fixed low down on the trunk
I can see this label from far away
it looks funny
_ and sad
And I cannot read it anyway
(But I might go down later on
to see my tree’s name)

Tree

of seasons and of colors
winter brown- study now

looking dark and dead Styes. dead.)
Rising in the tracked-up-snow- covered yard
Casting slender shadow of its form

Across the silent tracks
(of people, I suppose, no longer formse-justtracks)
Tree does not shout at all

And I have just noticed
(while some boys are walking- by
not making tracks
for the snow is hard and cold
frozen silent
snow will net record their passage)
Yes! just noticed now
that patch of brown
extending from the base
A mute brown carpet
protected from the snowfall by my tree’s
limbs

THE LAST CIRCUIT

In circling the camp

Jackson convinced him to expand
Their area

But the federals spoke of adams united
And a small empire

A long the wall

Mao built the ruin
Peasants to guard for
An imperial russia

To ward the hill
Teddy grabbed for his muslache
And cried
Rounds of freedom
J. Spell

Oh. tree
The Sun came out
(and you were there. i saw you, yesl i did)
Now 1 notice your aging gray
dark knots protuding
one 110' ’[WO
two broken stumps of bunches
softly now, you're wavingl
moving shadow into sun
wisperlng with dead, dangling leaves

i want to hear your secret I listen hard and long
so hard so long
so long.

the wind is only shaking you

often it will tear your leaves and limbs

the sun is only laughing

nelgher mu your mrpet speak or shout
aloud

old, old tree

your sun your SHOW

your colors and forms

remain

silent

i could never be a tree

(11, old tree
you're never mine
standing tall so tall
that windows fall to frame you
oh tree 1 seeyou're nodding Raw, Wt v. H.” ,
' silently again

DIGYERGLORY

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
ever wonder at you are

to a blot ascribe a medal
shower out of tag and jar

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
paper fickle, clay the lore
under do the clever teller
vaquery decided core

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
once declare the fringe along
tiny brittle space informing
distant fellow, winning fog

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
praising star and picture light
still between the rank and holy
quOte the drifty feather night

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
brake a snore the shoe unbound
grin the forest tired shadow
stirring few the humble found

Drive on wig, dig yer glory
up the morning vendor wall

Do you have a lethal edge Roger Fm“

Which may subtly be revealed

To those of us who disbelieve

Your glandular appeal7

Your puffy neck

Your thickset thighs

All humbly do reveal

Vibrations oi the deepest tones

Sent forth from your pineal.

Obese away! Volupt with us!

Eradicate the void.

Let’s worship well the only way:

Let’s pamper your thyroidi

Haunted houses

they hold a mystery too deep to know
held firm within twisted walls;
writhing minds which guard forever
hidden desires and untold secrets.
warped within themselves is life
cold and remote as stars,

but close, too close for us to hold
see, they come, beating at our doors.
