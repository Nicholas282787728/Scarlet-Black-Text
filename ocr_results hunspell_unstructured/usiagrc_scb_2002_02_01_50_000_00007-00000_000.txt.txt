3;; In late October, the Health Center
é: began offering Plan a, a form of the
; "morningsrter pill," to students for
35. Most doctors in town and the
- emergency room also received the drug
for distribution. Members oithe Femi-
nist Action Coalition, speciﬁcally Ben
Gold '01, had pushed for the Health
Center to provide the pill, especially
on weekends. Due to budgetary can,
straints, the Health Center is not
open—and thus does not provide Plan
Bion weekends, but Director of
Health Services Karen Cochran still
, identiﬁed the addition of Plan B to
' ‘ the Health Center’s services as a "posi-
tive step," saying the Health Center

, is "trying to progress.”

Residents of Grinnell voted down a
proposal to rund the construction or
a new library and public safety build-
ing. These buildings would have re—
placed the current structures, deemed
inadequate by the city. The library’s
size is a major problem. Library Di—
rector Lorna Caulkins explained that
the library ”needs to withdraw a book
for every new one [added]." A new
public safety building would have al-
lowed all fire equipment to be stored
in the same location and increased
training and storage space for both
the police and ﬁre departments. The
projects would have cost no mile
lion overall, raising property taxes
by 51. per $1,000 of taxable valua-
tion.
