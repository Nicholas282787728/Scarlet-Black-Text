Until very recently I was but
another sheep in the big herd of
ignorance. another person indulg-
ing in a puny battle between elcr
merits of myself that are no more

fellow Grinnellians the cosmic lib-
eration that my recent exposure to

ﬁeld if you will, munch quietly for
a moment, and KNOW.

But ﬁrst a dedication. I owe my
freedom entirely to a New York
City taxi driver, who for reasons

will soon discover, I never would
have ﬁgured l'l" out on my own. So
on with it. ,.

Human beings are, in utero, the
perfectest creature in the entire
universe and it is the meddling of
what we may call “space aliens"
that are to blame for everything
(EVERYTHING BAD that is).
Remember notwanting to leave the

when you did. you exposed your-
selfto (airbome) alien gasses, (For
theexceptionallydroidsheepishand

centa protects you from such stuff).

The ride from LaGuardia to

catogorization, computation. and

you with trivialities that may. in

“Born perfect” may seem vague,

people, 92 times as smart as you
thinkEinsteinwas.and withahigher
opinion of yourself than Michael
Kent. Alien (and inherently imperr
fect) cultures. as yet undiscovered
by the multitudes have their own
understanding of perfection.

A lot of things begin to make
sense now. huh? Take the almost
universal exploitation of women,
for example. No one knows why.
and yet we all do it now. don't we?
Don't bleat in agreement at once, I
know you do. Women kicked us all
out of the womb. Sheepwives and
ﬁshbots alike. Or so we think. The
guy with the blank slate idea was
really on to something. He was
probably done in by the space aliens

AGAINST THE GRAIN
Additional Truth

First off. apologies to all readers
for a certain incoherence in my last
column. Pre-submission, spacer
conscious editing destroyed most
of my transitions. Hopefully.
however, the idea of the Ideological
Equity Committee was adequately
communicated. This column is a
follow up.

The National Education
Association, in its
handbookprintsthc
Code of Ethics for
the Education
Profession. Under
Principle One.
Commitment to the
Student, the Code states. "2. The
educator shall not unreasonably
deny the student access to varying
points of view. 3, The educator
shall not deliberately suppress or
distortsubjectmatterrelevantmthe
student’s progress."

On Feb. 2. the idea of the
“President‘s Committee on Equity
in Ideological Instruction” was
presented to President Drake for
consideration. In a meeting with
this writer, the president expressed
that he was not willing to establish
such a committee. In addition, the
presidentwasnolWillingtoestablish
anad hoe committeetodetennineif
there was a need for such a
committee. Further yet. the
presidentwas unwtllingtoestablish
the committee on a trial basis. and
maintained that a student initiative
supporting theestablishmcntof such
a committee would not alter his
position.

The president‘sjustiﬁcation was
as follows: he did not feel that the
committee would be viewed
favorably by the faculty, and that
the establishment of such a
committee might interfere with
professors‘ “right to teach.“ In his
own words. thecommitlee “sounds
too much like a watchdog group."

The president maintained this
position despite being reminded that
the committee would have no
enforcement power. and could only
make recommendations. The
president also maintained his
position after being reminded that
no other campus organization
provides an outlet forcomplaintsof
bias. not the EPCs, not the SCC.
SGA has no structure to deal with
such complaints, nor is there any
facultyoradministrativccommittee
through whichastudentmayrequest
theinclusionofdiffetingidcologies
in a course, The President stated
that the absence of an outlet for
complaints of bias was probably
purposeful. The President
acknowledged the liberal slant of
the Grinnell experience, but stated
that students are free to use the

 

library as aresource if they disagree

By Mike Kent

with a particular textbook, or the
slant of a particular class.

Basically what it boils down to
is that yes. Grinnell is biased left.
but no. the administration will not
establish a committee to remedy
that problem. and students who
don’tlikeitcan gotothelibraryand
get their own damn educatton.

This writer does not feel that the
President has given
sufficient grounds
for disallowing this
committee. In the
ﬁrstplace.inregards
to the fact that the
faculty might not
like the fact that a committee such
as mis exists. that seems to imply
that this college is here for me sake
of the faculty. rather than the
students. Similarly. the “right to
teach" argument carries with it the
assertion that as students. our right
to information—the education
we're paying for is somehow
below the faculty‘s“t-ight" to tell us
whatever they want Apparently
the “right to ‘teach"’. is more
imponant titan even our right to
know if a bias exists, Apparently.
we as students do not even possess
the rightto makerecommendations
to faculty as to how they might
broaden our Grinnell Experience
through the introduction ofvarying
ideologies. We have to just trust
our teachers and hope that what
we're getting is something that
vaguely resembles the whole story.
Have faith, blind faith.

Of course, we always have the
option of going to the library and
researching a topic in more depth if
we suspect there is information we
are not being told. Though if we
have to go to the library and cross-
check every subject we’re
introduced to in class. why do we
need professors at all? We could
curl up in the city libraries of our
home towns and save $16,000 a
year.

This writer does not know if the
president‘s views on this committee
mirror the views of the faculty.
Certainly some departments will be
more concerned than others, but it
is this writer’s hope that the faculty
does not view this committee as a
threat. Thecommitieewould notbe
banning textbooks or advocating
the removal of instructors, merely
making recommendations. which
could either be accepted or
discarded.

Regardless. however. of the
administration or faculty‘s support
oropposition to this committee.itis

Board on Feb. 28. As it'does not
