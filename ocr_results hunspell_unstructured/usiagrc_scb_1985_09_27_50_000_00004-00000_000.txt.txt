Universities are places to think, right?

Finding myself alone on a warm, breezy
spring day at lowa State University. i
decided to brave the crowds and my own
ignorance. and explore the campus,

1 was surrounded by uniamitiar streets,
people, and other scenery. The campus
was busy, every sidewalk and building
teeming with a coloriul assortment of in-
dividuals. Eyes watched my every move,
it was an uncomfortable situation: lwas a
social pariah in a community oi people
who i didn't know. who didn't know me.
about me. or of me, and probably didn't
care. i was just another iaee, a shapeless
personality. bobbing in and out of the
multitude. an abstract of a person deiined
solely on iirst impressions. l was as it
made oi clay; the potters and craftsmen
were people l never knew, would never
know. who created a iigurine irom
judgmental perceptions and molded my
day with their smirk or smile

Ultimately, I would reflect my makers'
conception; ii they thought 1 was unusual,
unkempt. or unlit, my demeanor would
assume that guise; if they thought 1 was
normal, attractive. or special. my spirits
would rise to meet their expectations,

i checked my jeans and teershirt, fluifed
my hair. practiced a smile, and prepared
to throw myself amidst the throng of ar-
tists. at the mercy of their perceptions, I
ambled about the shops on campus. wat-
ching other people. Witnessing a herd of
pretty girls in the distance, i would casual
ly direct myself toward them, 1 imagined
that l could manipulate their
securities/insecurities with my own
evaluations. Acting accordingly to a law of
relativity. the closer i came. the less pret-
ty they appeared. My illusion was shot-
tered as the thick makeup, tawdry
clothes. and air at extreme attectation
struck me, I realized how similar l was to
what i believed they were

My mind was suddenly iilled with Vls

person was his own merchant and product.

To the editor:

I have heard. irom {acuity and
students. the statement “This article is
not professional.” or “The reporting is
not professional," or ”The paper didn't
look proiessional." in fact. l can safely
say that to percent oi the complaints to
which 1 have responded included the
word “professional" in conjunction
with the S and B.

The people who bring this charge
against a college newspaper are right,
it is not professional However. theyare
very wrong, by deiinition. to expect it to
be professional. According to Webster's
Third International New Dictionary
(1976). the word "professional" means
”Participating for gain or livelihood in
an activity or iield of endeavor often
engaged in by amateurs," As students.

on the paper were computed, and then

resultant figure would amount to less
than a dollar and a halt per hour. Then.

Not that I'm complaining. mind you.
The job is fine, however. I am an
amateur, I am not a proicssioilal
reporter or editor. nor do I ever intend
to he one Do not expect prolcssioiial
nork from me. Expect me to attempt
the best amateur uork possible. and

do we need to impress?

Pensive and disillusioned, I purchased a
sandwich to satiate one aspect of my
hunger and searched ior a place to dine
and think. I gravitated toward a quiet and
isolated bench placed centrally on the
grass between the triangular contigurac

llave you ever noticed hoiv ttiere are
hardly ever lootball players at the end oi a
line? This was perplexing to me at lirst.
but now it has become clear why this is.
They are trying to cnhalii -the iootball
reputation at Grinnell. 1; ping to the
head of the line. they s ve time. albeit at
the expense oi others in this way they
may devote more time to their studies. and
thereloi-c have more time to practice I
feel that this is really iniportantal a school

discoyci-ed is the vast .iinount tit friends
that football playci have, especially at

the trout of a line shows their confidence,

follow this truly remarkable example i

i trust the sludt‘ltl body realizes lion
much time the football players are spells
ding to enhance the spul'ls atmosphere at
this college. i only hope it proyides better
results than it has to date.

With slanted posture. a ridiculous grin,
and a hali~eaten sandwich resting numbly
in my raised hand. 1 sat. alienated on the
