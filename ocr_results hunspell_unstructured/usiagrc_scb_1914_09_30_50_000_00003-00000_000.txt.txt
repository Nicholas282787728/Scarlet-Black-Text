PRES, MAIN TALKS 0F
DREAMS AT VESPERS

Says Dreams Relieve Work of Its
Drudgery.

“This is the age ior dreams," said
President Main in the beginning or his
talk at Vespers Sunday. “We are apt
to lind a dreamer at the heart of every
nation, and at the bottom or this great
movement, democracy.

“A vision or the meaning or your
work will make it a joy," continued
ilr. liiain. “Work is a drudgery be
cause we do not dream out its means
iug. Dream because work is an every
day ueoessi ,_ it brings its own
i‘eward,~stl'ellgth, health, and, great-
est or all, the rision ot the meaning."

“College," the speaker pointed out,
“is otten called preparation. Do not
allow anions to persuade you that
dreams have no value in this preparn-
tion, Lite is lull or pel‘plexities, but
do not i'eltl to the weight or them
Nothing will destroy one's liio so
quickly as to surrender to real work
We are here to work, and to get capac-
ity or vision. Dreams always lend man
to a, higher place. There is no drenm
so great that there is nothing more
beyond it."

President Main closed his address
with the words, “May the world snv
oi you when you go from here, ‘Eellold
the dreamer and the worker.’ "

washer choir, and assisted in the rendi-:
