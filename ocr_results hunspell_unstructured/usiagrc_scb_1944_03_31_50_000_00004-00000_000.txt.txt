Drop Me a Plumb

can you pass the Plumb Line
test? We warn you, your whole
future depends upon it. Beside
it, the sinion-Binet takes a back
seat. Does your boy friend care
if you have an I. Q. of 135?
Nah. All he cares about is, can
you pass the Plum Line test.
That's oniiacouiita the Plum Line
test measures your glamor, zip,
urnpli. and other similar trite
phrases. Who ever heard of a
Powers model with a figure like
a question mark? Your back
has to be straightiso straight
that a plumb line could be
dropped from the back of your
gleaming mane to your grubby
heels.

Your correspondent dropped
over to the gym this afternoon
to see if we had anything to live
for. First we were weighed,
which we'll skip in this discus
sion because that's strictly bee
side the point and anyway evA

we were measured—haven't
grown an inch since we were
twelve. Then, oh then, we were
admitted to the inner sanctum,
(Creak. This is your hostino
that's something else). Anyway
after learning that we had lord-
osis curve, which unlike most
curves isn‘t good, we had to fill
out a questionnaire.

Thoughts while filling out

isimy gosh, a childvbrlde) Are
my parents healthy? (Should I
tell them about Dad’s arches?
No, it would be a permanent
black mark on my college record.
Things like that might be bored
itsry.) Do I have any brothers
or sisters? (Do I have to go into
all that? Are they healthy

Hats this time are smaller and
sillier but lotsa fun, Thcy have
even reached the point of creating
half-hats (cute as anything), os-
trich “froufs,” nosegays stitched
on a (singular) ribbon, and the
comparatively conservative oper
crown arrangements. Likewise
shoes, not to be outdone, have also
been done much with. The prev-
alent low lieels, both comfortable
’and serviceable, are offset by the
extremely flattering short vamp “
They come either streamlined orl
decorative, but the classic spectn-l

riotous play shoes will be big sell-

Congralulalions e -

l’r's a Band!
~ - for Cleveland

student council conventions have
produced a lot of thin‘gsiusually
bitter {curls and student council
presidents, But this is a year of
remarkable events and the 1944
convention was the first ever to
produce a fullrgmwn band.

The Cleveland Cuddle Cats,
originally known as “that band,"
who made their initial appear
once at the convention, are fast
becoming a Grinnell institution,
as anyone ever walking up the
loggia after lunch can testify.
Last Saturday at the faculty-
student party the band played
their way into the hearts ofGrlne
nellians. “All rumors that it was
the Virginia reel. not us, that
they liked. are entirely talse,"
testified .band members. “We
were good and we have the shake
guns to prove it."

Already the band has grown

to include ten pieces. “We can
play more than ten pieces
though,” said Marjorie Blumen-
schein, conductor of the local
branch of the Philadelphia symr’
phony. "We can play anything
you want and practically any
type of music you want. In fact,‘
if you ask us to, we will."
The Cuddle Cats have already
become a campus success. More
than that. having played at two
functions, they have become a
Grinnell tradition. “We did it.
all for Grinnell,” the Cleveland
musicians stated. ”As soon as
we get our union cards we’ll give
a concert in Carnegie Hall and
then Grinnelll will remember us
and be proud."
