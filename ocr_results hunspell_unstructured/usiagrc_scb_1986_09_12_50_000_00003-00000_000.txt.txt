Before any changes can be effected,
Perri said the first order of business will
be to hire “within the various language
departments additional staff in order to
iree up time so the instructors can begin to
develop courses, components of courses,
ireshen up language skills, [and/or] ac-
quire language skills."

Thereiore, according to Perri, the tirst
year of the grant will be spent with the
issue of hiring as well as student and facul~
ty profiles in languages. Consultants will
also be invited to examine current
language programs and talk about dit-
ferent methodologies and approaches.

The College was one of 15 undergraduate
colleges invited to apply ior one of the 15
grants. The $500,000 grant awarded is part
of the Pew Liberal Arts Enrichment Pro-
gram designed to encourage the revitaliza»
tion and strengthening oi traditional
liberal arts disciplines,

In addition to Perri, Professors Jan
Berkowitz, French, and Don Smith,

drug arrest. He said that when the oiiicer
saw the marijuana. itwas within his power
to arrest Fulmcr ior possession,

As ior the issue oi drug arrest on cam»
pus, Tom Crady, acting Dean oi Students,
said that the police do not need permission
to come on campus. yet they tend to avoid
it. Crady said “the college and the local
police have a very good working relation
ship." In terms oi drug problems, the col-
lege tries to handle the issue internally
before going to the police, But Crady
stresses, “we will not turn our heads to any
violation oi the law."

Way Out
in London

By Shelley Reid ton location in London,
England)

There must be some trick to convincing
one’s body that what it distinctly believes
is four in the morning is acutally eleven
o’clock and nearly lunchtime. Simply
listening to an airline stewardess mumble
something about Greenwich Meridian
Time and moving your watch ahead seven
hours doesn’t work. The brain begins to
catch on, but the body refuses to come
prehend anything except that it has been
rudely awakened from a shallow, disturb-
ed sleep, and that the neck and back
muscles are permanently cramped toward
the window ot the airplane.

After two cups of coilee and some cold
water on my face, i was finally able to
open my window shade and deal with the
niiddav sunshine illuminating the English
countryside bclow, England! I don’t know
why it surprised me; perhaps it's just that
no American who has never left the States
rcally believes that other countries exist.
It's all a hoax put over on us by the media
using scenic backdrops and people from
central Wyoming, backwoods Tennessee,
or downtown Newark who haven't learned
to speak English correctly. Regardless or
how vividly Mr. Smith lectures about
medieval villains and cotholders scrambl»
ing for every inch of their land, it’s not un1
til one actually sees the fields carved like
jigsaw puzzles out or the rolling coun~
tryside that it begins to seem real, As we
ilew into Gatwick over villages, small
castles and forests where the trees were
planted in neat, regular rows. my caiieine—
prodded brain began to comprehend the in
comprehensible: i was no longer in the
States.

After a train and a short tube ride from
the airport, I was in London. You have to
see it to believe it, but since you’ll ash the
questions anyway, I’ll just answer a few of
them now. There are red doublerdecker
buses. The English really do drive on the

wrong side of the street. except in London,
where they drive anywhere they can
squeeze their little cars (a good reason to
take the tube). The bobbies really do wear
these domed caps, and don’t seem to find it
embarrassing at all. The English really do
address each other as "dear,” “luv,” and
‘mum” even when they're paying their
electric bills. They can even leave the
public lawn chairs sitting out in Kense
ington Gardens Withrlut juvenile delins
quents removing them. Yes, the vending
machines in ordinary tube stations sell
Cadbury chocolate bars, Believe it or not,
there is such a thing as a “Portrasloo,”

When you're a part of Grinnellsin- ’
London, you get to iind your own ilat. Flat
hunting is nothing to panic about;
everyone finds a ilat Right now, however,
the memory oi those two utterly panic
stricken days is much too fresh. If you are
by nature very calm, t; have lived on your
own in a large city (Grinnell doesn’t count)
before, searching the classifieds in the
Standard is a good way to find a flat. lfyou
have even the Shadow of an idea that you
don't know what you're doing, glance
through the Standard once (just to say you
tried it), and then throw your pride out the
ivindow and get a ilat agent.

Either way; you still have to do all the
walking, all the tube-riding all the climb-
ing up and down endless ilights of stairs.
You will still come out oi any given tube
station, glance at your London A~Z map,
and head confidently off in What turns out
|o be the wrong direction, Most important
ly, you still have to lower your standards to
the point where a shower becomes a lux-
ury and raise your price range. Seventy
five dollars per person, per week is
reasonable by London standards, But
there is nothing quite like the jubilation
that hits when you‘ve finally settled on a
Hat. paid the money, signed the papers,
and gotten the keys, I simply can‘t find
words to describe how we felt when we ar-
rived at our very own ilat, in London,
England, unloaded our Suitcases from the
taxi, inserted the key in the front door, and
read the message scrawled on the wall
next to it, "Fuck Americans."

It was so lovely to be home.
