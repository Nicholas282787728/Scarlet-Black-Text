HAVE AN ACTIVITY

Freshmen who are athletes, debaters, or mus-
icians, while in high or prep school need not feel
that they are out of such things now.

Grinncll offers excellent opportunities to new
students who want to go on with the outside ac-
tivity or activities, which particularly strikes their
fancies, ' w n i’ .K(

The yearling athlete méy show his prowess by
trying out for the freshman football, cross country,
basketball, and track teams, or he may prefer to
help win a cup of plaque for his building, in some
intramural sport, Freshman women are urged to
select some sport such as basketball, archery, or
tennis

In the debate line, the Merrill debates often
bringr to light freshman talent which may be used
on the varsity team the following years.

Aspiring journalists may tly for staff positions
on The Scarlet and Black, the Malteaser, or the Cy-
clone, or if they are inclined to write essays and
stories, they may try for the Tanager staff, or the
Steiner prizes. ‘ iii

If they are musicians, positions are open for
them in the college orchestra, the band, or glee
clubs.

Too many people come to college solely for
What they learn out of books. This should not he
the case. There is much to be learned in college
which cannot be gleaned from printed word —
through contacts with other students, responsibilia
ties, no matter how small, mental or physical exer-
cise, and many other things.

Every student should have some Sort of activi-
ty. He should get into as many. as he can handle—
without hampering him in the scholastic work—but
at least one.

HOOVER vs ROOSEVELT IN IOWA

splurge the donkc s assets at Sioux City.

chcr before in the history of presidential
campaigning have both pal-tics sent their stalwarts

THE SILENT WITNESSES

Eleven men, the coaches, two agile ycll Icad-
crh. and about 15 spectators, helped win Grilinoll's
first football game last night. Many more spotter
tors showed their Pionecr spirit by keeping “quiet
hours” throughout the entire game,

A Stranger who saw last night’s fracus would
have been astounded (0 hein- that the Grillncll Sills
dent hotly takes an active interest in seeing its
athletic, team win, There has been more enthus-
iasm shown at some, important ping pong matches.

All indications point toward another strong
Grilulcll team this year. But the Pioneers will meet
a number of other strong teams before completing
their schedule. That’s where the Grinnell spirit
will have *to come in.

Grinncll has always believed in its traditions
and tricd to live up to them. One of them has been
the strong support it has given to its athletic teams.
Lot’s revive it, and bring it back to life.

Two more homc games remain on the Scarlet

andelack schedule, Cornell, and the homecoming
tilt with Creighton. Let’s make enough concerted
noise at those two to carry Grafluntl and hisi war-
riors through the entire out of town scheduler
Michigan State included.
TRIBUTE

Although this is a bad year all around, to find
means to come to college, and niany institutions

have shown sharp decreases in attendance, unof-
ficial reports show that Griinlcll will probably
have almost, if not, as many students enrolled this
year as last. A small increase was shown last year.
Recently, Nicholas V rray Butler, president
of Columbia university, in pointing out the out-
standing colleges of the country, chose Grilmcll, as
the leading college in Iowa. For a long time, she
has been known as the “Harvard of the Wes r”

Grinuell ranks high scholastically in the na-
Crcdits sent from here are accepted, almost
universally, because of the high caliber of the fac-

tion.

ulty and students.

Athletically, the Pioneers are ranked as one of
the four leading schools in the state, although the

enrollment here is by for the smallest oh the four.

Iowa, Iowa State, and Drake, are the other threat

After thinking it over, there is small doubt
that Grinnell has been able to weather the depres-
sion comparatively easily, while other institutions

have had to close their doors.
