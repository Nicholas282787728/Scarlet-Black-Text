The S&B’s Kenneth Yeung talks to visiting scholar—in—residenoe Tissa Jayatilaka during his last week in Grinnell

5&3: Professor Jayatilaka, thank you for taking the time to talk
to us. I think many of us who haven’t gotten a chance to talk to
you or take yaur class would be curious to know more about you.

Jayatilaka: I was born in Columbo, the capital city of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is a very small island across the southern tip of India,
and it‘s just a bit bigger than West Virginia at about 25,000
square miles. I came from what I would call a middlerclass
family. I came from a rather large family. I have four brothers
and two sisters, which makes seven of us total. My father was a
postmaster and a civil servant. My father was not a very rich

man, but a postmaster was a very respected figure in the com- '

munity, like a teacher would be. We were comfortable but we
were neither wealthy nor poor. My father was able to give us a
good education and provide the basics in terms of material like
clothes.

5&3: I know you grew up in the ’50: and '50:, Has anything
changed in Sn lonka since then?

J: When [grew up, life was much less hectic than it is today.
Sri Lanka was a very peaceful and calm place. But Sri Lanka
today is a total contrast to what it used to be. It is a very
violent society because ofthe terrible insurrections in both the
North and the south of the country. The ones in the northern
part of the country are still continuing arter almost 20 years
now. 1 can give you one example to illustrate how much things
have changed. Back in the ‘505 and ‘503, if someone found a
dog’s dead body on the side of the road, probably been hit by a
careless motorist, people would be terribly shocked and drs-
turbed. Most of the people would take care and bury the dead
body.

5&3: That’s one ofthe virtues you could ﬁnd in many Buddhist
cauntn'es like 5n lanko, isn’t it?

J: res, and Sri lanka is still a predominantly Buddhist country,
where 3uddhists make up about 70 percent of today's popula-
tion. They used to treat animals and all the things around them
with a kindness and gentleness. But today, 30 or 40 years later,
you see human dead on the road and people would just look
the other way. It’s not that they don’t Care, but'they’re so
frightened. Thats how terrorism has ripped my country and we
have one of the most horrible terron'st groups in 5n lanka, the
Tamil Tigers. We have lost more than 60,000 of our citizens in
the last 13 years of war. Can you imagine that? Parts of my
country has become so exceedingly violent that it’s something
none of us could have imagined or believed possible years ago.

5&3: When did this unrest begin and how has the 5n lanko
government reacted?

J: The wars Started in about 1953 and before that there were
sporadic incidents of violence. When there is violence in soci-
ety, the government, and in this case my government in Sri
Lanka, tries to counter that and becomes violent as well,
[doesn't] it? So we do have terrorism on the one side and we
have antirterron'sm on the other side. Sometimes I am torn
between trying to find out which is the greater terror, you
know? Is the terrorism of the state to be totally excused or

condoned? or do you also have to condemn the state’s terrore
ism as well? tspeciallyin my country, the tragedy is that we’re
killing our fellow citizens. As they say it’s like brothers killing
brothers and sisters killing sisters. This tragedy is made so
much worse when the state army of Sri Lanka is righting with
some of it own citizens, and them killing each other.

5&3: What doyoll see in thefuture as to the unrest in Sn' Lanka?

J: I don’t know. In fairness 1 am a very world-weaned person,
soIam probably a little more skeptical than others. ican'tsee
an end in sight but most of my peers think that I am too
negative and i should be more optimistic. But given what I’ve
seen, 1 could only be pessimistic. I can’t see an end in sightc

5&3: Let's change the topic a little. Would you share with us
something about your college life?

J: I entered the University of Ceylon in 1970 and I had four of
the most wonderful years there. 5n lanka was called Ceylon up
until 1372. I had fabulous teachers and I receive an honors
degree in English there. In Sri Lanka, there are two major
languages, Sinhala and Tamil. 3ut English is usually the lane
guage of instruction at the postcsecondary level. The school
had about some students and it was a residential college. In
many ways, rt was very much like Grinnell. It was located in an
isolated part of the country and the town was very much a
college town so during the summer it wasn't very alive. After
graduation I started out as an assistant professor in English
literature atthe University of Ceylon. And subsequently I moved
on and did graduate work in the United States at Smith College
in Northampton, Mass, It‘s a women's college butthey do have
a few men in their graduate departments.

5&3: Eeing the one of very few men in a women’s college like
Smith must have been very interesting for you.

J: Ves, indeed, it was a wonderful experience. It is a great
institution and Northampton, Mass. is a nice place. There were
about 75 men in the graduate level. And in this one American
studies class, 20 of us we were from 15 different countries. 50
it was like the United Nations. Ishared a flat with three other
students from the UK, Israel, and Switzerland. We used to have
all sorts of arguments and we tried to solve all the problems of
the world, like a lot of college Students do. It was wonderful.

5&3: What made you decide to study at Smith, or in the United
States?

J: Actually 1 was looking to go anywhere in the world outside
of sn Lanka for my graduate studies. But the United states
was the only place that was offered financial aid to foreign
students. There is another reason I decided to come to the
United States. Iworked as the director ofan American culture
centerin 5n tanka from 1977-1982. So in that capacity I had
close contacts with American professors and government ofri-
cials. I had also traveled to the States in 1981 and gave talks.

5&3: Would you say that working as the director of the American
Cultural [enter in 5n Lanka led you to your current work with the

Fulbright Commission?

J: I think so. I began my work with the United States-Sr] Lanka
Fulbright Commission at 1989. And from 1984 up untilthen I
worked as the special assistant to the director of an organizae
tion called the Colurnlw Plan for Economic and Social Develop
ment in the Asia Paciﬁc Region, which is headquartered in
Columbo. I think all my previous experience with working for
these international organizations would have contributed to
my present position.

5&8: What is the purpose and function of the United States-Sri
tonka Fulbright Commission?

J: The United States-Sr} Lanka Fulbright Commission adminis-
ters the Fulhn'ght Mutual Academic Exchange Program between
States and Sri Lanka. This is a program founded by former
Senator William Fulbright from Arkansas. Senator Fulbright was
also at one time Chair of Foreign Relations Committee in the
Senate. The whole idea started when he came back from 0x—
ford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1946 and he thought it would be a
good idea to establish a similar program with other countries
as well. So he proposed the Fulbright-Hayes Act which in time
became the Fulbright commission. There are currently 118 coun~
tries in the world participating in this exchange.

5&3: How didyoll choose Grinnell?

J: I had been interested in taking a Short break to come to
teach‘for some time. Since I host American students when
they come to Sn' Lanka and I keep close contacts with the
program directors in the States, I am constantly in touch with
the academic community here. So when I looked around and
wondered where I would go, a very good rnend of mine and a
professor in religion at Bowdoin College, John Holt, suggested
that I come to Grinnell College. We had been friends over the
years and he's the founderand direclor of the Intercollegiate
Sri Lanka Exchange program (ISLE). So he got into contact
with Gn'nnell and they had everything arranged.

5&3: What was your first impression of the town and the Col
lege?

J: My first impression was that Grinnell was very quiet, small,
leisurely-paced where nothing overly dramatic happens. It was
what I expected it to be because I had known central Iowa to
be mostly a peaceful and rural farming community.

5&3: What was your impression of the students here at Grinnell?

3: I found them eager, intelligent, receptive, and very courte-
ous, I am not saying this to flatteryou or some ofyour fellow
students, but I must say that I really enjoyed my contact with
them both in and out of classroom. I always found people
walking down the hallway and they would say helloiin gene
eral very friendly and polite. That made me felt pretty much at
home and I didn’t feel like I was an outsider.

5&3: Do you feel that Grinnell is any different from other America
colleges you’ve been to?
