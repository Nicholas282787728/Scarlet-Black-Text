SMPMNH NWDURM:
SUB-FREE
IN SMITH

Frankly, my subrfree firsteyear self
was scared of10/10. Everything I’d heard
sounded Bacchanalian. That reputation
also made rhe party sound exciting and
highly entertaining, but my friends andl
decided to take the safe route. We orga-
nizcd a party of our own in Smith, next
door to the action. We bought food and
thought up acriviries that weren't entirely
lame. When the day arrived, the only dif-
ference from other Saturdays seemed to be
how early the sirepaclts came out.
Initially, we were all content to sit in
the Smith 2nd lounge watching Sixlml
Card/er and playing with bubble-wrap.
By the time 10/10 reached Younker, the
movie was halfway over and curiositywas
taking over. The amount ofpeople in the
lounge at any time kept getting smaller,
and how often the movie needed to be
paused increased. The breaking point in
our little getrtogether was the moment
one friend looked out a window and said,
“Halfofcampus is on Younkci‘ beach!"
For the experienced Grinncllian, that
may not seem novel, but our freshman
eyes had never seen so mliny people do

one may ﬁnd covering the logs as in late Sep -

témher to promote 10/10. It can ens y be called the‘ ‘«

largest party oflhe year, and after this pastwcelcend's r
debauchery, even the ﬁrst- years have been clued in to
its nature. But while students may understand the way
the party operates, many may not know the origins
of the party.

Sadly, the story oflU/lo has been muddled and
lost over time. Alum james Oliver ’06, a former or-
gnnizct of the party, has returned to the party every
year since his first 10/10, when he was a prosple in
2001. Last year Oliver made an attempt at the all»
campus shot to tell the tale of10/10,but to no avail.
“My friend Rick and I attempted to revive the spirit
lost by talking about campus unity at the all-campus
shot but the belligerence and [alcohol] consumerism
of todays students didnt allow for such a speech, '
said Oliver.

Founded by Nate White '00, 10/10 began in 1998.
There is no deﬁnitive account of how it started, as
different alumni remember various reasons. "Apparr
ently a couple guys wanted to throw a birthday party
for their buddy in the “905.32 idea behind it was to
throw not only a birthday party, but a huge blowrout
the entire campus could enjoy," said Oliver.

organizet,r=mcmbers the pnrry existing for a different
purpose. "From what i remember it began as a Came
pus unity party to bring North and South Campus
together," said Pearson.

Another reason that has been cited for why 10/ 10
is thrown at this time of year is that before this year, the
10th ofOctobu was the date when Grinncll students
received their ﬁrst paychecks. And what do nil good

THE PARTY STARTED

Grinnell students do with their ﬁrst paycheck?

One thing' is certain: this' is a party intended for all
of the college to attend. For the entire campus toérrjoy
this party, the original o‘rghnizets decided that instead
of one mainlocation, a progressive partywould be; -
order. A progressive party, much as the name imp re ,
requires students to move from dorm to dorm as soon
as the alcohol runs out.

“Starting at Norris, the party moved from Gates to
Mac Field to Younker to the forum for the all-campus
shot, which happened precisely at midnight, followed
by parties in Loose and Gardner, said Oliver. .

With the additions to campus, such as the c
of East Campus and theft): Rosenﬁ' ’
path of10/10 has changed slightly,mbving some orthe .
kegs into East Citmpus dorms, and the campus shot *
has shifted to Mac Field .

The location of the party is not the only change
since the ﬁrst 10/10. Though 10/10 began, as the braint ,
child ofa few zealous partgying students, the party has
come under the care of the Frisbee team. Members,
