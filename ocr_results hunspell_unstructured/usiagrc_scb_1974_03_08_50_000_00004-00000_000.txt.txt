If a tree falls in a forest devoid of human life, is there any sound'.7

lf tour students run for the top oiilce in student government and
less than half the student body votes, is there representative

' _ government at Grinnell College?

Monday, every Grinnell Couege student can make his or her mark
on the shape of Grinnell for the year to come by marking their

ballot for SGA President.

in addition to being the recognized spokesperson for the Grin»
nell student body, the SGA president, because of the wide-ranging
appointment powers available to him, will have a marked enect

on the Grinnell Experience.

Both the Social Coordinator and the Student Coordinator are
appointed by a committee of which the incoming SGA president
is a member. Traditionally, however, the committees defer to
his wishes, because he must work with the new appointees.

These two officers have a tremendous impact on the lives of
each student. The Student Coordinator is the student ombudsman,

one way
solved,

a student can cut through red tape or havea problem

The Social Coordinator will determine what kind of entertain-

ment comes to Grinnell next year.

Working with a sizeable

committee, the Coordinator will allocate more than $20,000 in

student funds.

Thus, when voting for sea president, a student is actually casts
ing a vote on who he wants in many key positions. At this point,
even the candidates can’t say who they will name. But their stands
are clearly delineated, and their goals should give a clear indica-
tion of the kinds of appointments they will make,

Last year, the students advocating the end DI SGA ran their own
write in candidate u Frosty Coldspot. Frosty was the resident
refrigerator of a floor in Read Hall, and he ran for president
to represent those students who felt a refrigerator could do just
as good a job as anybody else in running SGA.

This year, no writerin campaigns have developed. Apparently,
some people have given up completely.

We have written editorials in the past about sinking ships needing
captains. But, SGA elections do need votersi

Whether you think SGA is an amusing three ring circus (which
it has been at times) oratraining ground for future Richard Nixons,

its effects touch us all.

John F. Kennedy once quipped that his lather had offered to buy
him the election, but had told him not to buy a single vote more

than he needed.

At Grinnell, when beer sales and sea elections coincide, one
could conceivably buy the whole election lor 99:; (plus tax),

Well: Vole Hansen

To the Editors: ,

The program which John Hansen
has set forth is both straightfor-
ward and innovative. Hansen him-
self is an independent, critical the
latter, a fellow who will not be
easily taken in by the bureaucra-
tic vocabulary which at times is
employed by the Executive Coun-
cil and the administration to put
students off,

As chairman of the Iomt Board,
I have seen HansenrepresentNorris
Hall with the serious commitment

- that every house president oughtidr
eally to display. He has the intellr
ectual confidence to press strongly
for the proposals he believes in.

Although he has been involved in St-

and any underling causes for the
problem come out. You will for-
give me if I am not optimistic that
the administration and CBS. can

to a public forumYourletterseems

I think that Dean Walker was less
than candid with the Grinnell stUr
dents at that Thursday night C.B.S.

disappointment with him when I
read his and your letter the next
day. The letter provided more than
its share of disappointments for me
-r a full list would run too long for
this letter, but I will deliver one
to you if you like. Considering your
statement was two pages Iong,there
were a lot of disappointments.

SPEAKING OUT

studens during last week’s CBS Sponsored open forum in South Lounge.

Anonymous: Decries Execulive Council ‘lllreals'

To the Editors:

We are two Grinnell students who
feel compelled to comment on the
response of the Executive Council
to the grievances expressed by
(3.5.3. Admittedly, the CBS state-
ment was in some ways misleading,
and could have been worded in a
more diplomatic manner, However,
we feel that the response of the
Executive Council was no more
diplomatic in its implications.

The reaction of the Executive COA
uncil, as expressed in their letter
of March 2, 1974, demonstrates th-
eir concern over the C.B.S. grier

vances. The Executive Council
seems, however. to be concernedfor
the wrong reasons, They appear to
be more concerned over the proof
or disproof of the charges made by
(2.8.3. than over the far reaching
implications of their letter. C.H,S.
believed that several members of
the black community of Grinnell
College had been discriminated ag-
ainst by certain members of the
faculty, Whether or not the asser—
tions can be proven or disproven
is only a part of the issue. What
is very important is the fact that
black students are concerned with
their survival on this campus. And,
they were concerned enough to voice

their dissatisfaction to the campus
community as a Whole. The Execu-
tive Council, in its response to
C,B.S. seems to have treated the
matter as a mere misdemeanor.
In the words of the council, “in
future anyone contemplating public
allegations will call in question that
person’s continued membership in
the college." This implies that a
student at Grinnell can no longer
feel free to voice his grievances
to the campus community without
the risk of expulsion from the coir
iege, Instead, students are cautions
ed to take their concerns through
"due process," where the issue is
likely to be quickly dismissed.

In a couege where a sense olcom-
munity is an important part of the

overall experience, it is of utmost
importance that the concerns of the
students be the concerns of the fac-
ulty and the faculty and administra-
tion cannot treat such concerns as
punishable ottenses.

C,B.S. called for the resignation
of two members of the faculty be
cause they felt that they had been
discriminated against by these pro—
fessors. Yet the administration se-
ems to think that the ”Grinnell
Experience” has been jeopardized
by these allegations of cos. But
certainly the spirit of the campus
community is not uplifted by the th-
inly veiled threats of the Execu—
tive Council,

Dunn: Ulllmalums Do llol Work

To the Editors:

If there is anything that is not
needed in the current situation res
gardlng Concerned Black Students
and the Sociology Department, it
is the issuing of more ultimatums,

Douglas: Withdraws llama From Race

To the Editors:

I would like to explain the circum-
stances surrounding my candidacy
for the office of SGA President,
and my'reasons for subsequently
requesting that my name be with
drawn. ,

The impetus for my campaigncame
from a group of fellow students
sincerely interested in the future
of student government at Grinnell.
The publicity on campus is the re-
sult of their labors. At their urg-
ing I allowed my name to be placed
on the ballot, This took placeshort»
1y before the filing deadline.

Afterwards I spent several days
reconsidering and evaluating that
decision. Numerous individualsur—
ged me to stay in the race and exr
pressed their support for my candr
idacy. Against these pressures and

my own desires to run were per-
sonal and academic considerations.
My decision was by no means easy.
Finally I concluded that the office
which I sought was incompatible
with my academic goals and per
sonal interests. After a careful
look at my rationale for studying
at Grinnell and my philosophy of a
liberal arts education, I concluded
that my time would be better spent
in work on the Political Science
Edu ﬁqhal Policy Committee and
acti es closer to my intellectual
interests.

My deepest thanks go to those who
spent time on my campaign and to
those that expressed their confi-
dence in my abilities to fill the offs
ice. I hope that they understand my
decision.

aCk students at Grinnell, and to ans
tagomze a number of people on this
campus who, it appears, have been
looking for an excuse to venftheir
frustrations at the Black students
for various and sundry reasons,
some of them, I suspect, dating
back to Reconstruction times.

The “fight fire with fire" strat-
egy put forth in the statement by
the Faculty Members of the Elle,-
cutive Council was astounding inthr
at it seemed calculated, even more
so than the statement by CBS, to
provoke a confrontation rather than
a Situation where these problems
can be resolved, and to equally
obscure the many legitimate poi-
uts brought forth in the statement.

I ceminly would hope that mem-
bers of this college, be they stu—
dents or faculty, have been aware
enough 01' the ”real world" in the
last few years to realize that poli-
cies of ultimatum, threat, and con-
frontation can only spawn ultima-
tums, threats, and confrontations.
Can this be what the Faculty Meme
bers of the Executive Council are
trying to achieve?

In short, I think your letter reflr
sets an effort on vour part to dis-
credit C,B.S. It reﬂects an ap-
parent attitude on your part to
fully integrate Grinnell. It reﬂects
an attitude on your part of “to hell
with Black students »-lettbemleave
if they don’t like it," Your off—hand
manner in dealing with white stu—
dent grievances saddens me. Pei-s
haps the problems Grinnell now far
ces can now be traced to your gen:
eral attitude. But, white students
grievances are small compuredwith
the grievances or Black Students.
The whites wantan attitudinal change
which is perhaps utopic. The Blacks
want to change an attitude which is
ubiquitous and undocumentable.
Perhaps all changes areimpossible.
By ignoring white students you mir
ght seal Grinnell‘s late and could
insure lts demise. By apparently
ignoring Black students you may be
contributing to the racial problems
of our society, In one case you
hurt Grinnell, In the other, the

entire country.

Your remark is especiauy callous:
“If any person is unable to par-
ticipate within the terms of Such
an educational venture “(one run by,
your discretionary power overcom-
mlttee and faculty decisions) “then
that person needs to ask ifGrinnell
College is adequately suited to his
or her needs." Telling Blacks to
quit Grinnell is about as much of a
cop-out as saying that your incredr
ible committee system is theproper
channel for anything. I sincerely
hope, for Grinnell’s sake, that you
don't take this school into bankrupr
tcy on a platlorm of “Iowanness”
and permanently besmirch its good
name.

PS, The Executive Council’s lett-
er ni March second obligates me to
expand my letter.

in the first point of the,faculty’s

letter, they fail to provide the pose

sibility of public disclosure of the
facts. In their second pointthey pre—
sume to set themselves above pub
lic opinion. And, in theirthird point,
they threaten to expel anyone who
voices complaint against their perr
sons: “We affirm that in the future
anyone” (the entire membership of
05.5.7) ”contemplating public 31»
legations of this nature should
understand that such allegations
will call into question that per—
son’s continued membership in
the college,” (Whether the alle-
gations are true or not?) it appears
the acuity has found a new way to
“pressure” students outofGrinnell,
I was not aware that the Execu-
tive Council could vote my expul»
sion -- perhaps I should not he wri—
ting this p.s. \
I hope, Mr. President, won't tur

this entire matter over to these
senior faculty members with the
idea that they will Settle honors
ably with C.E,S. and inform the
students of their findings.
