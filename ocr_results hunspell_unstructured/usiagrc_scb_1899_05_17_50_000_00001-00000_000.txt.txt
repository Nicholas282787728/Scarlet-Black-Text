The Ball Trip.

was

As expected, Grinnell
found the teams on tlle‘lllinois
trip in much better condition than
when they played at Grinneil,
Monmouth. though shut out,
played a very good class ot hall,
and Knox held the Griniiell team
in suspense until the ﬁfth inning.

Fair weather and lair attendance
accompanied the good success of
the team, and the management
and team are mutually well satis
lied,

On Friday atternoon Grinnell
played the ﬁrst game at the trip
with Monmouth College. Grin-
nell started the ball to rolling with
two scores iii the ﬁrst inning, and
added two earned runs in the RCA
otid, Doe contributing to the cause,
a “two bagger." Rawson a single
and Fisk a single. In the third in.
ning Grinnell failed to score; out
in the fourth another “two bag-
ger" by Doe. a sacriﬁce hit by
Rawson. and a steal for home
scored another run.

In the ﬁlth and sixth Grinnell
failed to cross the plate. In the
seventh. on a hit by I-Iiggs, two
bases on balls, and an error, two
more runs were added, and iii the
eighth another. Grinnell failed
to score in the ninth, leavtng ﬁnal
score. Giinnell 8, Monmouth 0.

Clark was in the box [or Grin»
nell and pitched a ﬁne game, hold-
ing the Monmouth team down to
one hit, and walking but one man.
In the seventh, Doe kept the team
troni scoring by a running catch

ol Gibson‘s long drive into right
ﬁeld. One or the good teatures
of the game was Higg's catch ot
a toul ﬂy attei a long 1un in the
second inning. Following is the

Knox's ball fans were out in
goodly number and ivere repaid
with a line game. Lucas was in
the box tor the locals, and Higgs
tossed for Grinnell.

Attairs took on a serious aspect
in the ﬁrst inning when neither
side scored. and things looked
still more interesting for Grtitnell
when at the end of the second.
Knox had crossed the pan, and
Grinnell was shut out again. Nei~
ther side scoied again tintil the
ﬁlth, when Grinnell bunched hits
fora stiin of nine runs. A base
on balls, an error, and seven hits-
ea single by Talt, thrcc hagger
by I'Iiggs, a single by Wheeler.
another three hagger and asin-
gle by Cog, two singles by Herr
did the worlt. A sltut out for
both sides came in the sixth. In
the seventh, a single by Talt, a
three bagger by Higgs, and a sac-
i'iﬁct' hit by Wheeler, scored two
earned inns. Neither side scored
in the eighth, but Knox scored one
in the ninth on aim and an error,

On Monday the ball team were
at Peoria where they met with ex-
cellent treatment from the Shit
dents and taculty or Bradley In-
stitute, They were invited to the
Institute for lunch and were serv-
ed in elegant style by the yoting
ladies of the cooking department.
The game in the alternoon was
exciting, -nradley having the lead

 

ol 6 to i at one time. About the
sixth inning however, Gilnnell by
bttncliing hits and aided by errors
made several runs. On account
of some close decisions there was
a little wrangling but it ended a-
greeahly. The score at the end
of the game was [277 tor Grinnell.

Tuesday Gririnell again met
Monmouth and here met with
her ﬁrst defeat this season, Monr

On Saturday evening, May 13.
the meeting was called to order at
the usual time by Arthur Rlsser.
the vice-president, who occupied
the chair in the absence of tin?
president. The attendance has
hardly as large as usual for the so»
ciety. The scheduled program
was followed out, tvith the excep-
tion of the debate, which, in the
absence ot the assigned speakers.
Risser and Velin, was given ex-
teniporaneotisly.

The ﬁrst number on the pro-
giam was a humorous lecture by
Quaire, Choosing tor his ilieine
”Insomnia,” he gave a fairly well-
pi-epaied discourse, which was
characterized by ahurnorousstrain
throughout,

The second number was a care-
tully-prepared paper by Moller, a
synopsis and criticism ot the
drama Cyrano de Bergerac, by
Edmond Rostand. In addition
to the synopsis. lie illustrated the
style of the author by quoting
some of the more striking and int»
poitatit passages lioni an English
translation. This is a very in-
structive and interesting feature
or the society work, and is, per
traps. hardly as prominent as it
should be. , '

Then came the extcmporaneous
work proper, consisting, as usual,
of the threcrniinute speeches. HP-

ordinary wasthe eulogy on Chrcs-
tomatltia, presented by Mr. Mc»
