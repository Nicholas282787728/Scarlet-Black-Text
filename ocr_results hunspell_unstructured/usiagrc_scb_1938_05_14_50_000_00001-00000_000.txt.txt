Paper Makes Campus

Unsightly Spectacle

A light wind blew long strips
of tissue paper over the campus
last nightipaper which clut-
tered up the shrubbery around
the library and Alumni Reci—
tation hall, paper which clung
to the trunks of trees, paper
which tangled in one's feet as
he walked along the campus
sidewalks, paper which com-
pletely whitened the men's in—
tramural field and hung from
radio aerial wires and from
tree limbs.

Pride in the college campus
caused Louis v, Phelps, treas—
urer, two weeks ago to order
the grounds about the library
and Alumni Recitation hall re—
landscaped.

For the past week men have
been working in front of those
buildings planting 170 young
Berberis Thunberg plants along
the inside of the sidewalk in
front of the buildings.

Last night the campus was
"decorated" by many feet of
"streamers," the second project
in the “landscaping" program!

Lloyd Pierce, president of the

Room Deposit Plan
Still Favored by
Sophomores

By Arthur Goshom

A special chapel on the pro—
posed year book for next spring,
consisting of an explanation of
the plans, open discussion, and a
student vote on the subject, will
be held Monday during regular
chapel period, it was learned tea
day from Helen Kolyn, president
of the sophomore class, sponsors
of the proposed publication.

The executive committee ofthe
class has been working on the
chapel program as well as the
plan for financing part of the an-
nual out of the students room
deposits, Miss Kolyn said.

Spence to Speak

John Spence, former president
of the Student Council, will give
a short talk on the annual to
open the chapel Monday morning.

His talk will be followed by a
discussion of plans led by a group
on the platform. Those who will
lead the discussion are Spence,
Margaret Hale, president-elect of
the League Board; Robert Whit-
ley, temporary business manager
of the year book; and Miss Kolyn.

Students Will Vote

At the close of the program,
students will be given ballots on
which they will state their inter-
ests in the annual, and whether
they would financially support
such a proposition,

According to Miss Kolyn, the
executive committee believes the
room deposit plan the most desir-
able way of financing the annual.
The committee, working on this
belief, has made a more detailed
study of the room deposit situa-
tion.

44 Exceed Room Deposit
0f the total number of students
paying room deposits last year, it
was found that only 44 exceeded
the 10 dollai deposit and that only
74 exceeded eight dollars,
Present plans for such a finan-
cial support of the year book call
for two dollars to be taken from
the room deposit to make half the
payment on the annual. The other
two dollars would be paid direct-
ly by the student purchasing the
book, one when the order is
taken and the other dollar upon
receipt of the annual.
A thumb nail sketch of a 175-
page annual was received this
morning from the Oliver and Dit—
son publishing company, one of
the prospective printers of the
book.
