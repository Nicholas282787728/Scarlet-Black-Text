New Horizons
clariﬁcation

Dear Ediror,

1 was very pleased ro see coverage of New Horirons Alternative
High school in rho Feb. 22 issue ofthc 5&3. I have cerrainly learned
a lor from rhe srudenrs and sraiirhrough volunreering ar rhe sehool.
and I believe rhar rhe program will only improve as more people
learn abour and undersond rhe school and us mission.

I did nor feel, however, rhar my opinion of New Horimns was
adequarely represenred in rhe srory. While we have ccrrainly eome
across many ehallenges in rhe process of purring rogcrher a newspa.
per, rhe pmcm lm been largely rewarding. The scli-dimcted phi.
losophy ofNew Horizons means rhar, for rhe rnosr parr, we are work.
ing wirh srudenrs who have chosen to parricipare in rhe projecr and

who are commirred ro making lr succeed. indeed. working wirh rhese
sordenrs and gerring ro know rlrem as people ha been one oirhe
highlighrs orrhe whole experience.

Funhermorr. rlae llexibiliry ofthc schedule and rhe eurnculum
ar New Horirons has helped ro make rhis projecr possible. While rhis
may make dadljncs and scheduling more ofachzllcngt ar New Ho
rirons rhan at mosr mime-15.1! some wirh irs own rewards, which 1
duly mmgniu and appreeiare. I do nor believe “die alrernarive high
school is even more of: challenge" rhan anyrhing else, although 1
was quoted as saying so in rhe Feb. 22 issue. I do believe rhar every
sinaarion and every experienoe comes wirh irs rewards and challenges.
some aspeeo ofproducinga newspaper are more diallenging ar New
Horizons rhan rhey mighr have been elsewhere, bur many ispects are
also more rewarding.

The srudeno and she sralr ar New Horizons, rhe freedom we
have ro pursue our goals, and die assurance rhar I will learn as much
as I reach are only some omie many aspects ofNew Horizons rhar I
have come ro value. These aspeers, more rhan rhe challenges, are
whar I dooeiare wirh New Horimns. They are rhe reesons l wanred
ro work wirh the srudeno on a journalism proieer. and rhey are rhe
reasons I keep going back.

I hope rhis tlmiﬁcs my opinion orNcw Horimns.

Budget committee

in his Feb. 22 arricle “Student parriciparion in budger process
approved," Michael Andersen reporred rhar presidenr Osgood will
allowone smdenr ro sir upon rhe college's budger sreering commirree
next year. Narurally, rhis should be a poinr oieelebrarion for all rhose
eurrenrly concerned abour ruirion increases and ocher college ﬁmn»
eial marrers; as I argued in a Feb. 8 guesr column, I do nor believe
rhar rhe commirree could honesrly supporr minimum 5 pereenr tu-
rrion increases each yearwirh srudenr voices decrying die "inequaliry
ofsacririce." Whar is lacking from Osgood's (and duly Jonarhan
Brand’s) reeenr dederarion is a rzenrly valid retzmn why studenLS were
nor placed on the commirree in rhis, irs inaugural year.

Andersen menrions rhree possible reasons: ﬁrsr. rharsrudenrs and
SGA don’r eonrrol “huge budget[s]”; second, rhar rhe rime commit-

menr may have been roo large- and mud, rhar soadenrs me abour
rhe college only in rhe shorr.rerm.

To rlae ruse concern, I argue rhar srudenrs, as rhe “customcrs” or
rhe college, eonrrol $36,790,000 (1300 srudenrs x 523.300 tuition)
ofrhe college's hudger by deciding ro attcnd—ox nor. Wish rhis large
ﬁnancial eonoiburion, smdenrs should have rhe righr ro decide how
rheir money isspenr. lr's rlearfrom che college'swebsirerhar Henry
Cornell ’76. who donared 31,500,000 (no small change, bur only 4
percenr ofrhe ruirion roral above), had very clear inrenrions for how
his money should be spent; 1300 smdenrs are no 1m picky.

To rhe second concern. I argue rhar rhe “illusory" nine hours per
week rhar Osgood eired is nor an unusual conrrihurion for a srudenr
ro make ro a campus group orcause. Asa member oisGA cabiner.
I spend a minimum of 10 hours per week fulﬁlling myduricsgedirors
on rhe 5m; srafr spend anywhere from 15 re 25 hours per issue.
Many srudanrs on campus addirionally work eampus jobs 8720 hours
or more per week in order ro meer rhe worksrudy porrion ofthclr
ﬁnancial aid package. In raer, rhe budger sreering commincc prob.
ably never had more rhan rhree hours ofmeerings per week—which
is abour rhc same rime eornmirmenr as being an SGA senaror.

To the rhird concern, 1 echo Osgood-s senrirnenr rhar ir depends
on rho srudenr or faculty member, bur also argue rhar shorr.rcrm
perspeerives on issues such as ruirion increases and orhers rhar di.
recrly aiieer rhe daily “cusromers” ofthc college (and, mayl nore, rhe
furore disgrunrled alumni given) ere imporranr ro balmcc the rrusr.
ccs' longarorm visions. Whereas on paper it may seem asolid decision
ro decrease reliance on rheendowmenr while increasing rurrion ro 9o
pereenr ofour pccrx’, a srudenr on rhc commirree would undersrand
how rhnr affect: her and orher srudenrs during rheir four years in
arrendancc in realeworld, microeeonornie rcrms.

son eabiner, nor her Paul Ford '02 and Gabe Rosenberg '03,
roughr ro realize srudenr represenrerion on rhe commirree, despire
Osgood'x sronewalling. We were given rhe clear indieanon rhar if“all
wenr well,” srudcno would sir on she commrrrec in coming years.
Who was nor clear was why rhe oommirrec could porennally fail and
why ir would be a misrake ro have a srudcnr be parr ofthzt Failure as
well. Though 1 am rhankrul for rhe srudenr represenrarion inroads
made in rhe pasr rwo yerrs, on case wirh whieh srudeno were denied
an equal voice in rhis use leads me ro question rho morives ofuppcr—
level edminisrrarors for borh srudeur inclusion and exdmion.
