Dibble A, Clark A 14

In the best battle of the intramural
cage series, Dibble hall, last years’
basketball‘champs, defeated Clark hall
for the title Saturday afternoon, 20-14.
Good basketball was played by both
teams and on several occasions the
bdsket shooting by both teams Verg/ed
on the Spectacular.

After running the score to 14-5 at
the end of the first half, mainly
through brilliant shooting of Russ
Gray, who looped four long shots
through the ring, Dibble was held
scoreless during the third quarter,
while the Clark team ritn their total
to thirteen. McLain end Mellrath
played good ball during this period,
time and again penetrating the
Judges’ defense for counters.

The fourth quarter proved a repeti-
tion of the first, however, with the
Court house team annexing enough
points to clinch the battle. Lovejoy,
Building One, officiated.

Should we have inter hours on Fri-
day llllll Saturday nights?

Elizabeth Campbell “Yes, We
should—at least until 11:30 or 12, 0,
Almost every other school has later
hours than we do."

Theodore Peterson—"1 believe that
there are times when later hours
would prove advantageous and provi-
sions should be made for such occur
sions. By ‘such occasions' I mean
house parties, and so forth,"

nose Gcr0~“YeS! I think we should
have later hours. Because oi Satur-
day classes, though, I think the suge
gestion to have limo hours on Friday
and 11:30 hours on Saturday is a good
idea."

Elton Folletk‘it all depends on the
girl.”

‘L‘Drilllle Scllwﬂrzm‘Eleven o’clock
hours on Friday and Saturday nights
are all right, but I do think we should
have an extension oi time on nights
when we have formals and house par
ties." ,

Bernice Stocki‘umu might as \well

have now are late enough in the win-
ter but not nearly late enough in the
spring."

Julilt Jenselli'That would depend
on the date you had." _

Hill llood~“Sure, I think later
hours would be fine. i think it would
he a good idea to have 10:30 hours
on Friday because of Saturday class-

Correcting of Defective Speech

 

it,» Laurence l.uudcn

"One of the most important dercloo-
specrlr tod
tiliit of correcting the one who Stut-
ters, stammcrs. lisps, or otherwise has
defective vocal organs," said

, Charles Hem-y Woolbert in answer to
the question of the Intel-\iewer,
“What are the latest developments in
the field of speech?” Dr. Woolbert
will he remembered as being the out-
standing authori in speech engaged
in actual laborato ,v experunents to
correct the abnormal speaker through
Scientific cure.

“The studying or these persons
carriers around the study of fear cour
moses. Alter all, the conditions of
stuttering or stammering are due to
either too lo strain or too high a
strain in the ervous system. We at.
tempt to approach the core from a
psychol n‘ al standpoint, from the pc-
haviorist', viewpoint, However, we‘
also study the body in order to locate
the tension and strain."

In reply to the question of whether
speaking ability is inherent or Speakc
cl's\ "born" so to sneak, Dr. \Voolbert
laughingly replied, “Wind 'ammers are
born; speakers are mad . The iiip~
pant. glib. talkative persons 'are live
i clocks. They do a lot of talking with—
l out saying anything. in other words
they just run on until they run down.
That ability to feel at home on the
platform may be inherent, but only
work and training can make a
ccssful speaker."

Iiilllils Informal Debate

Dl Woolhert expressed himself
ve_ forcibly on the difference be.
tween the so-called English style or
debating and that prevalent in Am~
erican colleges. He said, "We must
come to realize that we must iimber
up, interest the audience, and human-
ize the debate. The old practice of
brow-beating the judge into a decision
has passed." Acase in point is llluse
trated in the University of lowa. Pal--

Tilke,‘ Third Place in 410.

Although Rinefort was on the hos?
pital list with a sprained ankle in
curred the night before in the Kansas
game, Grinnell garnered a place in
the K. C. A. C. indoor track meet at
Kansas City, Saturday. when Warner
Taylor, ’30, competing unattached,
placed third in the till yard run, in
competition against an experienced
field,

Taylor lead the race for practically
the whole way, only in the last few
yards relinquishing his lead to Ryan:
ot Kansas. An unattached runner won-
the other section of the pace thereby
placing Taylor in third place.

Taylor ran the low hurdles, but was
nosed out in his heat by- Dooruhos,
Jayhawker captain. With the comingi
of this boy into his eligible status.
hurdle and middle distance wins for
the Maltese cross seem highly prom—
ising.

Rinefort and dleeter competed in thei
the shot but neither placed, Itinefort
was unable to do more than throw the
ball from a stationary position. Meet
or did not place in the final rating.

 

, benefit of the audience.

Most important, Says Woolbert

liculnr stress is laid on making the
debate human and debating for the
or course, the
ailcctod speech and manner-ism of the
English teams were condemned as
ridiculous by Mr. Woolbert, How-
ever, in actual thought content and
eiiectivcness, the English style is
much to he preferred Mr, Woolbert
congratulated Grillneil in its effort to
promote this style.

The reporter happened to be inter»
cstcd in Dr. Woolbcrt's statement that
speech and philosophy were one
study, taught by the same man as one
field. The question of whether speech
wui‘e still regarded as speech and
philosophy combined drew the char»
acteristic answer from Dr. Woolbcrt;
“Need I answer your question since
you haves such splendid eyamples of
the art ol speech and philosophy com-
bined in the persons of John P. Ryan
and Mr, Knight?" In enlarging on
that point, the speaker said that to be

a successful teacher or speech one‘

had to be a philosopher.
English null Speech Are Ono

Dr. Woolhert was very emphatic in
his opinion that English should be
studied as a part of speech and speech
as a part of English. He cited the
case of a young man entering high
school as an instructor in speech with
an A. B, degree. That some young man
can obtain a very lucrative position
and still study for his Doctor of Phile
nphy degree.

In personal contact Dr.
has the smile pleasing personality
that won his audience last night. He
is a brilliant conversnﬁonalist and
successfully lives his text book, which

lilo-albeit

is so commonly known in Grinnell. At
present Dr. \Voolbert is given llnlilnit~

cd opportunities to engage in research

work in the department oilsneecn at

the University of low‘n, a department
that owes its present excellence to Dr.
Woolbert.

STUDENT COUNCIL

TO DISCUSS

SATURDAY CLASSES, IN CH PEL

 

The Student council will have
charge of chapel tomorrow morning at
which time Dean Nollen will explain
the proposed plan for Saturday classes,
The problem was brought before the
Student counell Sunday and it was de-
elded to have the studénts vote upon
the plan after it had been thoroughly
discussed in the various buildings and
cottages.

it was brought out in the meeting
Sunday that the existing system has
proved unsatisfactory due to the exten-
sion of courses in the various depart-
ments of the college, New courses have
been introduced into the curriculum
necessitating more hours in order to ilt
them into the schedule. The neces.
city of thklnl; required work, for ma-
lors and minors, together with the
many electives causes numerous con-
fllcts in the Student’s schedule under
the present system. The purpose of
Saturday classes is to eliminate this
difficulty. Most of the three hour

 

courses can be taken care of on Mon»
day, Wednesday and Friday but the re
mainder must, of necessity, lid]! on
Tuesday and Thursday with the extra,
hour to be’squeezed in where convert!»
ent.

It was further pointed out that the
present Saturday classes have proved
unsuccessful because most students do
not consider it a regular class day,
These classes are not attended regu-
larly and the lessons are not well pre
pared, There has been no attempt on
the part or the students to
ptke them seriously or to adapt them-
selves to the system.

in voting the students will determ-
ine whether they wish to have Satur<
day a regular class day, making a
total of six, or to have afternoon
classes with only ilve regular class
days. If Saturday is adopted as a.
regular class day afternoons will be
reserved for study, laboratory and red.
rertlon only.

According to the-plans, every

Weight and speed areadomiualiug
characteristic of the frosh cagers, who
have in their midst a liberal sprink-
ling of first year football luminaries.
These attributes are along the line oi‘
rcouisitcs that Coach Hayes deems
necessary, the lack at which has caus-
ed an important part of the varsity
slump this season.

Rose Show: Vitrsiry Class

Perhaps foremost among the embryo
Pioneers is Rose of Orient, husky
guard. Rose gives pron-rise of de-
veloping into a good varsity guard,
and will be able to call a good deal of
speed into play, along with his weight.

Wilhelm, Rock Island prep star, is
holding down a forward berth, but is
equally adept‘at the jump position.
‘Wililelm is of the rangy type, and
packs a mean eye for the basket. De—
Long has been performing opposite
Wilhelm at forward, and shows a good
deal of ability.- Perhaps the fastest
man on the squad, and endowed with
more than his share of fight. DeLonE
should be able to step into fast com<
pany when next cage season ’rolls
around. In addition, he has been the
most consistent scorer for’tlle fresh in
their Scrimmages with the varsity.

Grillnell Boy lit Gllln'll

Corrough, a local boy, is performing
at running guard. and plays a nice
floor game, being especially adept at
advancin the ball, He is on the shoot-
ing e'nd of a nice basket tossing eye,
and frequently leads the fresh in scor-
lug.

Rice, Flint, Michigan husky, has
been playing center during most Of’the
practice sessions, and may develop
varsity ability. Having the necessary
height, Rice generally can be counted
on to get the tip-off, but as yet he
lacks ability to work the floor. Dee
iensive work lies in the big fellows
line, and this may be the task picked
out for him by Coach Hayes.

McIntyre, Audubon, has been per-
forming well’ at or forward position.
and Liedtke, Ruck island, irosh grid
star, shows the making of a classy
defensive player. Dawson, Mnrshnll—
town, Turner, Grinncll, and Sharp-
burg, Bellevllo. all are reporting, and
may he heard from in future seasons,

Coggeshnll Ties For Phlnt Holmrs As
National Amateur chumps Win
Over Grinnell.

Minus the services of Chase and
Rinefort, Who were bothykent in Kim-
sas City because of injuries incurred
in the Jayhawker struggle, the Pin-
neer cage artists lost a fast game to
the Hillyards, at St. Joseph Saturday
evening by a 38 to 22 count, The
battle Was fast throughout, the Hill»-
Yitrds keeping II rather Safe margin
over Hayes' team all the way.‘

The Hillyards, national amateur
championship team of last winter,
played remarkable ball. The work
of DeBernztrdi, who was tied for high
score honors with} Coggeshall, Plo<
ncer forward, was the real high light
of the game, In addition to playing
a wonderiul floor game, the Hillyard
leader tossed the ball through the
hoop [our times from the field
and once from the foul line.

Coggesnall played well for the Pio-
llcers, scoring four times from the
court, and after entering the battle
performed an important part in ad-
vancing the ball. The Grinnell de—
fense was not strong enough to With-
stand the rushes Oi the opposing for-
wards, however, the ex-coilegians
scoring sixteen goals from the field
to ten for the Pioneer‘s.

McLain was the only player on the
Gl‘innell squad who did not break in-
to the scoring column. Fish, chemist

yards.
