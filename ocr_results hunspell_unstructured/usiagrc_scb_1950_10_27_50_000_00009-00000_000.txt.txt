Pioneers Face Coe in HC‘Til—

Not since 1936 has Grinnell
lost a grid contest to Coe, its
,traditionel Iowa rival, and al-
though rated a one to two touch
down underdog the
have no intentions of starting
tomorrow.

. l
Pointing for this game since

the start of the season, the
Scarlet and Black is definitely
capable of the upset of the
week. Looking at comparative
scores, the Cedar Rapids’ boys
only beat Monmouth one more
touchdown than Grinnell did
Saturday. Coe narrowly escaped

last week, just nipping last place‘

Cornell 14.12.

Mentally the Pioneers have as
much determination,
spirit as they will ever have
this year. and physically, with
the exception of senior end,
Chet Lacy, and sophomore cen»

ter, .iohn McClintock, out with‘

a shoulder injury contracted in
Wednesday afternoon’s practice,
the Pioneers will be at practicale
ly full strength, Backs Blougli
and Slocum will see limited 307
tion, but the rest of the team is
ready for 60 minutes service if
need be.

Reiiivenated by the Monmouth
success the Pioneers will face
Coe’s toughest grid outfit in ten
years, The Crimson and Gold,
perched atop the loop heap, are
unbeaten in conference play,
having downed Ripon, Mon-
mouth, and Cornell.

Coe runs from a regular split
T, popularized and currently
used by two big seven schools,
Missouri and Oklahoma, This
formation necessitates plenty of
speed in the backfield, a re.
quirement the Crimson and
Gold meet with several very
speedy backs. The Kohawks can
score equally well from the
ground as in the air. Quarter»
hack Leland Sclimitt has a fine
throwing arm, tossing most of
his touchdown heaves to his
backlicld mates. Wall Ford,
Coe’s tirst string iullback, hurt
in the first pcriod of thc Cor-
nell game, will not face the
Pioneers. \

Offense drills, were the order
at this Week’s Pioneer practices.
Particular attention was given
to down iield blocking, a much
needed area tor improvement

Named conceptalns tor the
game are senior lettermen, Boo
Bigelow and Bud Gregg.
