This should he undertaken as a
Grittnell proposition, rather than by
individuals. The local Red Cr‘ so and
the girls in the dittercut cottages at
the Quadrangle, have already made up
packages \0 send to American soldiers
in France. Can't we now devote some
time an: ﬁtting up pachages to send to
our own Grinnellianst ,

The houses at the men's dormitti ‘
could troll take tip the matter, Each
building could send packages to a Cel'r
