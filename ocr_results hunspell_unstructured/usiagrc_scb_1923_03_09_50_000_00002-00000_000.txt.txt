A JOB FOR. THE SENATE.

In a recent issue of the New Repllhr
_iic we find the following statement
made, "Now it may be that the {mm-i
ers of our state constitutions and
lawshavs gone too far in protecung‘
the rights of the individual citizen.”
The writer then goes on to point-out
that one man is often supported by
the law in actions which cause in-
convenien‘ce ahd often Suffering to a
great many people.
that article no doubt set it down as

any the matter.

The Situation is this. In the city
of Grinnell there are some sixty—rive
radio receiving sets, Somewhere on?
the campus there is located a sending
outiit'which when in operation makes
it impossible to receive anything other
than the trivial dot and dash messages

out by this station which

Although it is not right Lhitt the law
should allow sender: or airy nothings
(literally) the some. privileges that
are accorded the stations which really
send out important messages, Still it
is so. And if the government will
not stipulate that amateur stations

send only during the hours when
pr grams are not being brocdcasted
for the enjoyment or thousands or
people, then it is up to the towns to
make mics which will protect the
liberties ol‘ its Cltlzens.

in the case in question the seat of
the trouble seems to be located on
the college grounds so it so matter-
tor the college to settle and not the
town. It would seem that it rests
with the Men’s Senate to settle this
difiiculty in a way that will be shtlsA
factory to all concerned] Since the
owners of the sending Scis not. a
right to send and need the practice
it would not be advisiable nor inst to
prohibit the use of any broadcasting
apparatus on the campus. But it
wmlld‘be advisable to restrict the use
of such sets to the hours when no pl'oA
grams are broadcasted. Since there
are some sixty-five or more people
being inconvenienced and only two or
three getting the great joy of doing

that the best programs are broadcast—
ed, This would give the sparking
stations all the rest of the day in
which to rehearse the dot and dash
code.

An opportunity is now presented for
the Senate to prove whether or not
it is going to live up to its aim to pro—
motc better relations between the
town and college.

CENSORSIIII’.

Some years ago a gentleman by
the name or Upton Sinclair aroused
considerable feeling against himself
when he wrote a book called “The
Brass Check” in which he atmeked
‘tlle newspapers of the country for
allowing Capital to dictate to them
what they should not
print, Mr. Sinclair made no men-

should and

book; but this was not because they

that power which is to the college

world—the administration or "Board
of Control of Student Publications."

'ncner.

As a result of strict censorship we
hear of many cases where student
editors rebel. These cases usually
end by the publication being put out
or business‘ior a time or by the expulr

cases the editor is in the Wrong; but

The edito s or the paper can hardly
be blamed for resigning their pos-

Perhaps this situation is anomalous
