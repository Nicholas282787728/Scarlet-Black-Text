or a proiessor “I think that
students are not hesitant to come
see an RA here," says Frumkln.
She explains, “Because we're ad-
visers. not directors, there's no
punitive possibility there." Fellow
resident adviser Julie Frascr says
that the iunetion oi the RA is to
outline all the student's options.
For some students. Fraser thinks
taking a semester oii can be
beneiicial. “They can work on
things and get their locus back,"
she says, “I would not recommend
it ior every student but ior some,
taking a personal leave is a very
positive experience.” Adds
rrumkin, “if you have a problem
and you iall behind in your work,
you can't just catch up in one week
at a school like Grinnell.”

Resident adviser Steve
Langerud says that burnout oiten
results irom "11’ mg your hands in
too many pots. There are so many
things to be involved in when you
come to Grinnell There are
students who take lots oi classes,
have social commitments.
athletics, and extracurricular
groups. You put all oi those
together and sometimes it's really
overwhelming," he says.
Langerud advises students to
break down their day according to
which activitia are more wor-
thwhile to them.

Langerud remembers a woman
who came to see him at the end oi
the iirst semester oi her ireshman
year. “She had been very involved
and successiul in high school. She
iound that she wasn't doing that
well here." in tact, he says, there
was a chance that the student
would be put on academic probar
tion. Langerud helped the woman
improve her study skills, schedul-
ing. and time management.

For Mark, 'a ‘senior, the demands

great. and he elected to drop out

back at Grinnell and with a new
major. Mark comments that “I
really didn’t have a choice about
taking time off. My classes were so
demanding that i couldn’t concen-
trate on anything. »i hit a point
where I couldn‘t work at all,"
Mark remembers that he was often
unable to eat or sleep. “I was just
kind oi living on the fringe," he
says.

Mark cites the intense cams
petitivencss and drive to succeed
among many Grinnell students as
a contributing iaetor to his ieelings
oi depression. ”There's this suc-
cess ethic here, with people telling
you that oiings have to be done in a
certain way, that you have to get a
certain GPA. It can be really hard
ii you’re not doing well. I just ielt
like a failure,” he says.

Although Grinncll does not have
a mentalrhealth facility on cam-
pus, the college does have a con-
tract with the Grinnell Mental
Health Center lGMHC) which pm,
vides ﬁve tree counseling sessions
per year ior each student. ii the
student or counselor believes that
additional counseling is necessary,
sessions are arranged at a rate
agreeable to both parties.

Counselor Lisa Bard of the
GMHC makes a clear distinction
between cases ol burnout and
cases oi clinical depression, with
all its attendant symptoms. “With
burnout, it’s more a case of a stu-
dent not enjoying the advantages
of college student life." Bard
states that this incapacitation com-
bined with such symptoms as in-
somnia, changes in routine pat
terns, and unusual eating and
sleeping habits generally indicates
a case oi clinical depression. ,

Bard says, that problems with
coping otten rive from students'

realization that they have yet to .

t'orm their own values, to decide
what is oi importance in their
lives. "Students oiten come out to
college without having developed

what works lor them. They have
their parents‘ values. especially
about success. It takes a while [0
come around to what works for
them." asserts Bard. Bard
believes this process entails learn
ing how to handle both academics
ahd academic competition. She
snys the latter can be as “subtle as
someone asking, ‘What did you get
in your last paper?‘ “

College students are particularly
lulnerahle to stress and burnout
)ecause their traditional support
iystem — their iamily 7 is at a
geographic and, occasionally,
tmoticnal distance. “We have this
llusion oi college students being
:ompletely independent adults, but
nany are oiten using their iamily
as support." says Bard.

Bard reiers to the examples oi
students whose parents have
divorced, “Often one parent will
leave the home. The problem is
that the whole support system is
removed,” says Bard.

Bard points to a number oi warn»
iiig signals ior roommates. “If
your roommate was an early riser,
then sLarts getting up later and
later. ii he's skipping meals and
classes and is more withdrawni
then there's cause (or alarm,"
says Bard. She says the GMHC
aims at helping students build cop-
ing strategies through reducing
classload. learning relaxation
techniques. and developing new
social relationships, Bard believes
that a ‘small percentage" oi
studean use alcohol and drugs as a
coping mt chanism. “Most Of the
students me get here [who are
abusing dmgsl are using alcohol."
sht‘ says. “You can hide drug use

drinking."

Sonic stress can be an incentive
for students to work harder and to
perform to [hair capabilities.
However, Bard warns that ihere is
always the possibility oi becoming
tversstressed. “Stress is a bell-
shapeit curve and when you reach
the peak. the next place is down.”
cautions Bard, She says that some
students manage to ride out par-
ticularly strossiul periods oi
academics by devoting their time
exclusively to studying. and plann-
ing to socialize alter that period is
complete. The danger with this
routine. according to Bard, is that
students may become too concern-
cd with academics. She explains.
“They sometimes Can't get back
into the swing oi their relationships
quickly "

in the past two years. the
number tit college students using
the GMHJ has increased from 141
in 1985-36 to 163 in 1936787. Grady
attributes this to ”the more open
attitude people have now about
counseling and depression."
Although :Ihc could not reveal the
numbers. Bard said that each year
there are students Who are
hospitalized in the mental-health
ward ol 2 hospital in Newton. She
said that most of these students are
ones who are so depressed as to be
unable to periorm everyday lune»
tions, but some are suicidal. The
warning signs ior suicide corres-
pond almost exactly to those oi
clinical depression. ”In counseling
we call it a tlat aiiect." says Bard,
"The person doesn't get excited or
upset about anything, and doesn't
show anything,"
