Fire. is not unlike condoms

“in many wlys are is like yellow fever,“
writes an uncredited Icllmtcr in the April 8,
1949 edition otrhe $313. “It is a plague, a pos-
tilence, and must he treated as such." Why is
he so down on the hot stuff) The writer was
concerned because a recent
investigation of ﬁre safety
conditions exposed serious
shortcomings on campus.

The wrirer proposcd that
we deal with ﬁre 1i wc dealt
with yellow (ever. "This same
method, prophylaxis, can he the answer as
well to the dicnd horror of fire here on the
Grinnell campus and everywhere, We must
make a concerted assault on our sink-holes of
potential disaster," No, he is nor talking ahour
condoms or concrete, but a rather more cons
ventional method of fire prevention: carefulr

The writer believes that

Last issue, the .9558 got a kick out of making
fun ofBob’srTl-iat’s cooland all, but a couple of
things should be noted about Bob‘s. First, Bob’s
is a studentsrun business, as in those same people
who have mid-terms ..,or massive rcadingassign-
moms. Second, Bob's is run by students who are
fabulous people hur lack cars. This shortage is a
problem considering most ufBob’s supply comes
from Des Moincs. That nasty storm prevented
supplies from reaching Bob‘s, and then the next
weekend everyone was afraid the same thing
would happen, so wt; couldn't get food? Third,
iris widely noted around campus rliar Bob's was
the only place that made money last semester,
so even though it may not have the glamour or
consis ncy the Grill has, Bob’s has them dollas,
and, f‘
any kind or bagel and then serves it with salsa.
Eat that.‘

More guns needed on cdmpus

I really hate how people are so wimpy and
afmid nomdays. Someone gets shot by a pellet
gun and there's a campus-wide memo? Squirt

guns are banned and cops will come ifsotncon: is’

caughtplayingAssassinat-ion? Please, Before the
hip ies took over' this school, there was ROTC
an a shooting range. This fear of playful nor
lcnce is a manifestation ofour unfamiliarity with
the world around us. It used to be parents would
just send their kids outside to play where they
would learn a healthy respeer for risk through
trial and error. Now parents treat their kids like
they’re made ufglliss s appears to have caused

Random locking is infuriating
Whyrhe hell are random doors into the JRC
locked on the weekends? It’s no big deal,1 guess,
hut every Sunday morning, dragging myself to-
ward delicious brunch puff, 1 make a fool of myself
pulling on doors until I find the one that's'opcn.
It makes no sense. There are four doors. 1 want
rhem all to he open all day long so 1 pick doors as

l ehoosel In fact, why are any doors to building on'

campus locked during the day at all? Every time I
try to cut through the Harris Center, it‘s lock/3d!
And, alas! Eastst'acing entrance to the new Darby!
i wish I could open you. ,
