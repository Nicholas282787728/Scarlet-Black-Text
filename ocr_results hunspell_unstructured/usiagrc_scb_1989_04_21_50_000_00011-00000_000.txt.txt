The men‘s tennis team is
now 6-4 after last weekend’s
play. On Friday, Grinnell hosted
Ripon, perennially the best team
in con ference.

Conditions were windy and
cool, something both teams were
used to. The visitors, however,
appeared lnore at home, winning
eastly 9-0 despite some tough
play from the Pioneers. In
singles, for example, No. 1 Bill
Campus and No. 3 Alan Jeffers
took tltetr opponents to three
sets, while the No. 3 doubles
team of Jeffers-Ara Bulbulian
also went the distance before
succumbing to tlte superior visir
tors.

On Saturday, Grinnell
travelled to Des Moines to play
Grand View and Simpson. The
Pioneers eventually bowed 5-4 to
a strong Grand View squad, only
to rebound against Simpson,
crushing their opponents 8-1.

Against the Vikings, No. 3
Rich Pearce, Campos, and Ieffers
each won their singles matches,
along with the No. 2 doubles
team of Pearce-Campos. The
tight match unfortunately marked
the end of Ben Lezin’s season
long winning streak.

Grinnelt coach Jeff Westlund
cited a lack of concentration and
mental preparation against Ripon
and Grand View, “I felt we could
