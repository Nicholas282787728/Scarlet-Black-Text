RELATIONS “'1'1‘11 GRINNELL.

The Carletonia: The students
regret very much that athletic re—
lations between the two colleges
have been severed, tor the contests
in the past have been very«pleas-
ant and it is generally understand
that the students oi the lowa col-
lege were good sportsmen. We be-
lieve that the management at Grinr
hell is to blame tor the present sits
tuition and not the sentiment oi the
students themselves. We are not in
a position to criticize the athletic
system there, but we understand
that it ls not directly under faculty
control,

In the years ot 1914 and 1915.
Grinnell and Carleton played in foot
ball under a two-year contract, on
March 19, 1915, the presidents and
coaches of Grinnell, Beiiot, Knox
and Carleton met in a conlercnce
at Chicago and drew up a set or
regulations which were to govern
the iuture athletic relations be-
tween the four colleges, which re-
lations were understood to be per»
manent. it was understood, how—
ever. that Knox was to come in
only at times during the following
years.

Before Christmas or 1915, Coach
Hunt had been assured oi a foot-
ball game with the lows college to
be played at Northiield on Novem-
ber 18, 1916. Late in Jannary.
1916, Crinnell iniormed him that
this game would not be played and
gave no reason for the action. As a
result, the two teams did not meet
in 1916.

About January 16 or the present
year Carleton received an olfer irom
Crinnell to play tootball in Novem-
ber, 1917. The otter made Grinnell
the scene or the game altho Grin-

nell should have come to Northoeld.
Coach Hunt agreed to accept the of—
ler on the condition that a return
game be played in 1913. G- nell
would not agree to this until she
had completed her schedule with
her opponents in lowa and so Carle-
ton postponed the signing oi the
two-year contract until this sched-
ule could be ﬁnished. At the time
oi the conierence, Grinncll did not
mention that it was to her advan-
tage to play the lows colleges ﬁrst.
when the attention or Crinneli was
recently called to the matter, she
refused to sign a contract which
involved a return game. This was
the cause or the breaking oit ot
negotiations.

it is Carleton's policy to com-
pete with colleges that are willing
to continue the contests year alter
year, regardless ot the strength oi
the two teams at any given time or
or other temporary conditions

The dates made vacant by the
tailure of the two colleges to sign
a contract are already being ﬁlled
at Carleton. Many other colleges-
have the same policy regarding a
year after year contract and we
hope that Carleton's position on this
matter will appeal fair to those who
may have been attracted to the sit-
nationi

GRINNELL‘S sum 0F 1T.

Gi'innell has been very much sur-
prised that the Carletonia should
make such an attack upon the lathe
letic management at Crinnell. it
does not sound like Carleton and
we doubt if it represents the sent?

cut at the northern college.

Students at Crinneli, too, regret
that athletic relations have been
broken ott, 1n tact, it was not
‘supposed here that relations “had
,heen severed” but that plans were
already being wurked out tor con-
tests next year. The Carletonia
,editorial, however, brings the news
that relations have deﬁnitely “been
severed."

While we do not wish to ques—
tion the Carietonia’s sincerity we do
wish to point out the Grinnell side
of some of the “facts" in the above
,editoriali
l Blame is placed upon the ath-
letic management in Grinnell and
the thought that the faculty have
not been behind Grinnell athletics.
This is a mistaken impression be—
cause the iaculty does pass on the
plans oi the athletic director.

Probably the students. too, are
behind the athletic director in this
case Alter an agreement had been
reached regarding the game next
year "Doc” Hull says that the Carl~
eton authorities decided they want
ed a return game the following
year. Griunell students will not
question Carleton’s policy in this
respect for it may be a good one
to want two year contracts But
this return game would leave the
Grinn‘ell schedule with only one con-
test at home. What Grinnell stu»
dent wants a schedule in which he
will see his team play at home only
once during the whole seasonl Very
iew, in our opinion Sn probably
each college has some reason for
its wants in this matter.

When shown the above editorial
“Doc“ Huff expressed the same sur-
prise that Grinncll students have
ielt. one point which he emphasiz-
ed was that it was Carleton, not
Grinnell, which cancelled existing
contracts. Consequently, it his
statement is correct, the Carletonie
is blaming Grinnell ior Carleton's
own action. According to Mr. rind,

would play Carleton in iootball next
November. The Northncld coach's
telegram sent in reply accepted the
date. in our minds this mutual
agreement was a contract after the
custom or carrying on athletic ne—
gotiations. Yet later Coach Hunt
sent word by Coach Carney that
he wanted a game at Carleton tor
the following year. This could not
be agreed to here and Carleton can-
celled the contract already made.

According to “Doc" Hurt the santel
is true in case at the track meet
scheduled for this- spring. The rec-l
ords show that Carleton cancelled
that. Arrangements had been made
tor the one [meet in Crinnell this,
month. Then word canie irom Carl<
eton that the iaculty there would
not meet other institutions in ath-
letic contest without having a two
year agreement, This, oi course,
was a cancellation oi the scheduled
meet. , ‘

When both contests were cancelled
by Carleton as the records seem to
show, it is a big surprise to Grind
nellians to have the Carletonia
place blame on the local athletio‘
management for ”severed reiations.’ l
We hesitate to think that the Carl-
eton student body and iacutly are
behind the editorial, and we suspect
that it is probably the eitort oi
some one who has been somewhat
misinlormed on the subject, possi-
bly oi an inexperienced editorial,
writer, Crinnell holds no grudges
against Carleton students for what
is- said above.

Grinnell is sorry Carleton has
seen ﬁt to "sever relations.n Re-
lations with the northern college
have always been satistactory and,
much beneﬁt has resulted from ath-
letic contests between the two
schools. it is hoped in spite oi
what the Carleton paper has said
that contests can be scheduled in
the luture with the Mlnnesota ln-
stltution.
