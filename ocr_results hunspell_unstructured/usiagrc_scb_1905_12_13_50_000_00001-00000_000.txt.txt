CHAMBER MUSIC CONCERTS.
runny EVENING.

TheGril-lnellStringQuartette which
last year won a secure place in the
hearts of Iowa College and Grinnel]
music lovers as one of their favorite
permanent musical institutions gave
their ﬁrst Chamber music concert of
the present season, at the chapel last
Friday evening

The audience st somewhat smaller
than usual owing to the ignorancein
regard to the date for the concert,
on the part oi town patrons or the re-
cital course. Those who were present
however, were rewarded with a very
enjoyable program,

The personnel or the quartette is
the same as it. was part or the time
last year, as follows: L’iura A. Raw,
violin Dudley L. Smith, violin and
plunoi'orte: David E. Peck, viola;
Wendell Heighwn, Violoncello.

if one were to resort to odious coup
parisons he Would probably have to ad-
mit that Friday night’s concert failed
to reach the high quality of some of
those during the latter part of last
season. This was natural however,
and when circumstances are consid-
ered it was a concert Worthy or praise.

Perhaps the most enjoyable elfort
was the Schubert “Quartette in E“,
{or pianoforte and Strings. The sweet
adcgio and lightly tripping rondo
movements were pleasingly rendered.
Had it seemed best to place this selec-
tion at the end of the program instead
of the longer Haydn “Quart/ewe in C ”
perhaps the general effecton the audi-
ence would have been improved. But
the whole program was thoroughly en-
Joyed by all. Iulenuthltseemed that
the happy medium for such an outer-
tainment had been successiully reach-
ed, the entire program consuming
about one hour.

On Monday evening a second pro
gram was given by the Quartette which
was in every way superior to the pre-

cedingone. The ensemble Work was
smoother, there wasa spirit in the
work which had been somewhat miss~
lug on Friday evening, and the play-
ers seemed to work With a. greater
unanimity of purpose and action.

Collectively and individually the
work was more oua par with their
former skill and it is doubtful if at
any time last. season they exceeded
the ﬁne quality or musicianship which
was to be found in the ﬁrst movement
or the opening number, Beethoven’s
“Quartette in F.” The program also
was more attuned to the layman's ear
and was received with greater en-
thusidsm than that oi Friday nights

The Beethoven selection was par-
ticularly interesting, the adngio illus
crating especially well how a great
composer will build up it whole beauti-
ful movement from a single litlle
theme. The Scherzo which was rcallV
it ronrlo lllm‘emeilr. was very delicately
played.

accompaniment. The culnbiilaliun or
cello, violin and piano made a very
pleasing eifect. their tones blending
harmoniously throughout.

But without doubt the feature of
the evening was the Andante move
ment from the brilliant ”Concerto in
D ilat" by the giired Norwegian colu-
poser. Sindinz, played on the piano
(for the ﬁrst time here unless We are
mistaken) by John Ross Frampton
with the orchestral parts on the pipe

BASKET BALL

Freshmen Lead in Contest for
Championship.

Saturday's games brought out the
best playing up to that date. As the
games progress, the playing becomes
more open and there is more chalice
(or team work. The Seniors and Jun-
lors especially showed improvement.
The Academy did not show up as well
as in the game with the Sophomores.
The Freshmen played their same
steady game, defeated the Juniors,
and are still leading in the race for
championship.

1n the Senior-Academy game the
Seniors toulr the lead immediately, by
Graham tin-owing two baskets, and
kept it throughout the ﬁrst half. The
llalf ended with the score standing 1'2
mum favor of the Seniors. In the
second half both teams played faster
and the honors were about evenly di—
vided, each side scoring 15 points,
though the Academy threw more
baskets.

MR. TOWLE'S LECTURE.

Tclls oi an Empire Where Absolutism
Still Holds sway.

A number or students and citizens
oi lowa College and Grinuell were
present at the Congregational church
last evening to hear a well presented
and interestinglccture by Mr. It, A,
Towle ’96, on the subject ”A Mon
archy or the Soils." The speaker was
introduced by Proiessor Parker who
explained in brief llls career since
graduation and welcomed him back to
speckin the interests or the Bethel
Sunday school uhich he was interest-
ed in rounding while here in College.

Mr. Towle as he stated in his intro-
ductory words is not a lecturer by
profession. His interests are with
the Bureau or University Travel or
Boston. nutin the capacity of this
relation he has visited Europe several
timesand last nightiil turning aside
from his regular field, under the title
above mentioned, he gave an interest
ing account of some ofthe experiences
one must undergo in a trip across the
waves, “The days or absolu‘eism and
monarchial governments have passed
away on land“ he said,“but there will
always be empires where monarchs will
have their sway. Each snip is an abso-
lutegoverninentwiththeccptdinosits
king. ills word is lztw which all obey
{rpm the humble workman to the blue
blood aristocracy. But it is a despot

cord and when he becomes a member
or the monarchy he expects to obey
his ruler.”

He gave an idea of the size or an
ordinary passenger steamer: and the
diirerence in the cost or ﬁrst, second,
third and iourth class passages. He
mentioned the ucommedations while
aboard including the Marconi tele-
graph, the daily newspaper, the turk-
isn bath and gymnasium, and discus-
sed various amusements employed in
passing the time away. Society life is
