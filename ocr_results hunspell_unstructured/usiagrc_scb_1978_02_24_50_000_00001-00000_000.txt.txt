Illness invades campus

by Trena Cleland

Unofficial reports indicate that
around one-third of the Grinnell
student body has suffered from
either a respiratory infection or
stomach flu, or both, within the
past several weeks,

A variety of illnesses, most of
which appear to be categorizable
under one of two headings, have hit
the campus recently. The two main
ailments, according to Dr. B.G,
Wiltfang of the WiltfangrPaulson
Clinic in Grinnell, are pulmonary
inﬂuenza and viral gastro-

vintestinal disorders, more com»

monly known as a severe head cold
and the flu. The first has been by
far the more common of the two at
Grinnell Few students have ac!
tually reported-flu sym toms.
THE TWO illnesses, w ich strike
indiscriminately, have apparently
hit every floor of every dorm at the
college. An informal poll taken by
Resident Advisers Gerald Gurney
and Debra Stuart of Younker and
Smith Halls last Sunday indicated
that approximately 45 out of 150
students in the two halls had sufr

Solar development heats up

by Doug Schultz

Businesses, private citizens,
industries and governmean in

wa and across the nation seem to

e rapidly Warming up to solar
energy as an alternative way to
heat homes and buildings.

The number of solar heated
homes in the us. has quadrupled

the past two years. One
manufacturer of heating systems
in Marshalltown reports that
although he has only been
producing solar collecting panels
ﬁr two years, already he can't
ep up with the nationwide

_ demand,

THE NUMBER and amount of
state and federal grants for
research and development is

yrocketing. With state

- sistance, Scott Community
College in Bettendorf, lowa
currently offers a two-year Solar
Energetics Technician major, the
first and only one of its kind in the
.untry.

Grinnell College and the
Grinnell community got into the
act this semester.

AT THE invitation of the
Grinnell Service Corporation, a
$velopment organization run
under the auspices of Grinnell
Federal Savings and Loan Co.,
several faculty members and a
score of students have organized a
inject to assist in the design and
c nstruction of an energy efficient
home in northwest Grinnell.

The role or the group is to
provide analyses of alternative
components and design features

the house which will include
solar heating elements. The group
will consider site selection, design
features. such as landscaping and
insulation materials, multiple
energy sources (solarf cons
.ntional, woodrburning. etc.) and
monitoring capability. Included in
the analyses will be estimates of

relative costs of alternative
systems.

COORDINATOR for the faculty-
student group is physics instructor
Lambert Murray.

The project was the brainchild
of Al Elsenman, trustee of the
college and president of Grinnell
Federal Savings.

Since Eisenman’s business is
concerned with home investment
and savings, he felt it only ap
propriate that he and his corn
poration be able to inform people
about alternative forms of energy

and ways to heat their homes,
ElSENMAN said he hopes to
develop a plan fora house that can
be constructed at a cost of around
Sat-60,000. Since it is going to be
sold, it has to be built at a com-
petitive price. The only profit in—
volved. Eisenman said, is the in-
formation and education gained
from the experience and the house
itself, which will be a demon—
stration model.
Several students noted that the
project is limited by stipulations

CSL policy rejected

by Eric Berry

After nearly two hours of
parliamentary wrangling Joint
Boards rejected by a vote of 10 to 12
a statement of food service policy,
approved earlier this month by the
Committee on Student Life (CSL),
which would have redefined the
Food Service's boycott policy.

The statement now goes back to
the CSL for probable revision.

The CSL proposal stated that
there would be no absolute boycott
of any food item, that there must
be an SGA referendum involving
board students which would
specify the issue of cost. and that
while the Food Service would at
tempt. to provide an alternative
food, it Would limit expenditures to
the amount spent on the item prior
to the boycott.

According to the CSL policy. for
an alternative item to be offered,
at least 20 per cent of the students
must vote in favor of the boycott by
the end of September, The per!
centage of expeditures on

 

boycotted and alternative food
items would be governed initiallyl
by percentages in the referendum
vote. Thereafter, purchases of the

 

 

boycotted item and alternative
foods will be determined by actual
consumption levels. Had the policy
passed, all boycotts would have
terminated at the end of the year.

AFTER TWO minor amend-
ments altering the language of the
CSL proposal, Jim Stuart proposed
a substitute policy as an amend-
ment. His proposal differed lrom
the original in that it provided for
an absolute boycott if a majority of
students voted to boycott a food
and that a referendum would be
held at any time during the school
year if 50 students petitioned for
the. referendum.

Stuartk off-campus represenr
tative, stated, “it is important that
students be able to boycott a food if
something is going on like the
situation with California farm-
workers. Because of the boycott,
the farmworkels have won fair
labor Standards, better living
conditions. etc. . .The college is
taking a political stand either way,
whether it supports the buyers or
the boycotters. It is important that
the college acts as a whole if the
students want to boycott."

lered from some sickness that
week. Jim Behrens, RA. for Loose l
and Read Halls, estimates that
one-third of the inhabitants of
Loose have been sick and that
many of them are “just crashing"
in an effort to get well.

01“ ill people on Dibble third,
nine had been sick as of thisi
Tuesday. Only two of the nine had
had the symptoms of intestinal flu.
Eleven people of 20 on Smith
second had also suffered from sore
throats, slight fevers, coughs, head“
colds, stuffy noses, and body
aches. The sickness appeared to be
peaking for most students early
this week, and showed signs of
abating rather than growing in the [
near future.

Stuart Gilman, student adviser
in James pit, where seven of nine
students have been sick, said
however, that the outbreak “still
seems to be rolling along" in
James. A common symptom of the

, lsickness seems to be acute fatiguei

Gilman said that he has been
falling asleep “even more than
usual" in his classes. Although
some have consulted the Health
Center, most people in James,
according to Gilman, “are just
relying on care from friends. In
fact, one of lny most useful S.A. j
tools this semester has been a,
thermometer.”

STEVEN Brull, a North Younker l
sophomore, is a typical victim.’
Brull, who admits that “smoking‘
dope from a communal bong on
Friday nightwas a mistake,” woke
up Saturday feeling sick and “took
things easy” that day. Sunday he
felt better. but after staying up late
that night he suffered a relapse and
felt “absolutely horrible" on
Monday.

According to Health Center
supervisor Ms. In'na Hall, 170

argoyle keeps watch on

This placid fellow sccn'ls undistu

people visited the center and 40
tpeople called her complainlng of
{illness on Monday and Tuesday
lalone.

"LAST year we had an increase
about this time in upper
respiratory infections, although
whether it was greater (than this
years) or not i don’t know. We are
treating the symptoms as best we
can, We’re advocating ‘The Big
Three': fluids, aspirin, and bed
rest," she said.

There is no established policy for
closing down the school in case of
epidemic, according to Hall. The
decision to close would rest with
Dean Walker, who would only do so
on recommendation of the town
doctors. However, Stated Hall, “it
hasn’t even been discussed.”

Rumors that other Iowa colleges
have been dramatically crippled or
even quarantined are false. Cornell
College, in Mt. Vernon, has
reported no significant increase in
recent illnesses on campus. At Coe
College, a school of 1100 students,
about 200 cases of ﬂu or colds, a
fairly normal number, have been
reported. Drake University, in Des
Mnines, had its peak in illnesses
several weeks ago. Officials there
,reported a higher proportion than
usual of upper respiratory in-
fections, but nothing approaching
an epidemic level.

THE town of Grinnell itself.

according to Dr. Wiltfang, went
through a similar stage oi sickness
in mid-January. Wiltfang
speculated that when students
returned to campus in late January
they picked up viruses from the
town.
. It appears that the widely-
.pllblicized “Russian flu” has not
spread to Iowa, as no cases of it
have been reported.
