Stevenson, Spraguc arid Flanagan sang

contributed a duet which was tiie vocal

were the order of the evening, and the
howls of mirth (mm the audience tes-

some clever dancing, and Pleasaiits arid

Put On Clever Farce.

The last part ot the program was a
truce called "High Finance." This
drama concerned itself with two dar-lc
ies who, in order to bridge over a
ﬁnancial stringency, decided to pass
themselves oit as Jack Johnson and
his manager. Tile deception worked
but suspicion rose until the pseudo
Johnson had to consent to a scrap. In
the ﬁrst two rounds he was knocked
out, but made good in the third.
Greenwood, who played the part at
Johnson, decided to have some tun on
his own account: so when it came time
tor him to knock out the skeptical
’I‘ilff. he did it with a thoroness which
was startling in its realism, and then
play-hilly "knocked the tar" oit nulnr
ei-ous bystanders. Following is the

match was tllc fact that not a ﬂy ball
was hit to the outﬁeld. This accounts
for the lack of crrors by the dciellders
oi the outposts.

Although a squint at the box score
would seem to an outside observer to
indicate that Griniicll's chances at doc

ed, the truth is that most of the poor
ﬁelding was due to a lack oi precision,
