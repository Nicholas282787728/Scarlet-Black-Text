I from the editor

452 nays m camivim

The media and the government assure us the hostages were
released after 444 days in captivity, but have they really been
set free't7 Have we really allowed them to come home to their
lives and families or did they walk out of one form of captivity
and into another'.7 If they are indeed serving their 452nd day of
captivity, how much longer will we ask them to serve?

In actuality, the American people now hold the hostages cap-
tivel In our desperate search for national unity, a search we
began after World War II and intensified during the
devisiveness of the Vietnam era, we have re-taken the hostages
captive, holding them bound on our TV sets, in our newspapers,
magazines, etc., etc., etc

Of course we could argue the 52 Americans have a great
amount of information vital to our “national interests,” But
just how vital is this information? How much can the human
nervous system handle? We’ve seen incredible displays of emo—
tion on the part of the hostages and their families; how much
more hounding can they take'.7 Does that small Persian Gulf
country pose such a threat mat we can’t allow the captives to
run free for a few weeks, to regain their equilibrium, to see
their families?

The facts are we‘ve limped along for many weeks without
Iranian oil or assets, we‘re probably not going to re-open trade
with Iran for sometime to come regardless, and we certainly
can‘t argue the Iranians possess any dangerous “first strike"
capabilities In fact, sources close to the Iran-Iraq conflict say,
and the Algerians would certainly concur, that nobody really
heads the Iranian government at this point, and disorganization
is the rule rather than the exception. How big a threat is a coun7
try such as this?

The hostages have proven their loyalty to their country and
they‘ll continue to answer questions when called upon, but we
must allow them to heal their mental wounds first. We must
“call off the dogs” by turning to other pressing issues as our
40th president begins shaping our country‘s next four years and

Scarlet and Work,
