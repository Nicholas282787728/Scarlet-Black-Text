THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Ellen Karlson Tells Ot Cuba

by George Shybut

One year ago, 687 North Ame
ericans visited Cuba to view
life in the revolutionary state
and to help with the sugar cane
harvest. Among those on this
trip was Ellen Karlson, who
spoke in the South Lounge
Monday night.

Ellen presented a series of
slides taken while she was in
Cuba and gave her impresr
sions of what she had seen,
felt, and done in the country.
The program was initiated by
a previous visit of North Am-
ericans who hoped to inform
people of the upper hemisplr
ere as to the actualconditions
of life under Castro’s regime.

Each individual submitted an
application and was interview-
ed by a selection committee,
which then forwarded all the
gathered information to Cuba.
The 687 selected were then
transported to Cuba either via
freighter from Canada or by
airplane from Mexico. Upon
arriving, the group next tooka
sinweek work period and a
two-week travel period.

The large group was divided
into smaller brigades, cone
sisting of 25 North Americans
and three to five Cubans. Men
and women worked side by side
in the field harvesting cane.
Women were initially given the
lighter work of stacking the
cut stalks, but with time were
allowed to cut wne with the
men. An average day during
this work session consisted
of waking up at 5:00 A.M. to

Students

The music department will
present three student concerts
this weekend, featuringmboth‘
soloists and ensembles.

Friday night at 8 in Roberts,
Francis Gray on piano and
Carla Coffey on cello, both
senior music majors, will
perform a strictly classical
concert It will include Granr
ados-Piatigorsky‘s ”Ori
tale, Spanish Dance No. ,
Debussy's "Senate Pour Vio-
loncello et Piano", Boccher-
in s ”Concerto in Brflat Mar
jor for Cello and OrcheStra",
accompanied by-a Student ch»
amber orchestra, "Sonata in

Rhapsody".

have breakfast; working two
periods, 7:00‘11IUU A.M. and
3:00-6:30 P.M. with a break
during the hottest part of the
day, followed by dinner and
sleep.

The final two Weeks, the
group traveled by bus through
out the country, talking to
people, visiting schools, and
observing life styles. While
working, the groups received
a visit from Fidel Castro,
who helped cut cane and later
had dinner with the visiting
group. A group of Vietnamese
students, five from the North
and five from the NFL of the
South, studying in Havana,also
spent time with the visiting
groups in the field.

Ellen found the Vietnamese
did not express any hostility
either toward the youngworkr
are or the AmEriaan people,
but they had a distaste for the
U.S. government. The Vietna-
mese understood that the Am»
erican soldiers in Vietnam
were forced to carry out gov-
ernmental policy, and thus
were also victims of U.S. im~
perialism. Ellen furthernoted
that the Vietnamesewere con
sidered to be allies of the
Cubans in their fight against
U.S. aggression.

Unlike earlier visits to Cuba,
this group sufferedno censors
ship, and all pictures taken
were allowed to be kept. The
only difficulty arose in return-
ing to the U.S., which did not
want subversive materials
crossing its borders.

To Present

The Grinnell College Orchr
estra will present its third
concert of the year Saturday
night at 8 inRobertsLThe coni"
cert will be fairly short, con-
sisting of only three numbers:
the prelude to Debussy's "Af—
ternoon of a Farm", with Debs
hie Conard as soloflute; Beets
hoven‘s "Violin Concerto in
Demajor", with David Abel;
and a symphonicpoem entitled
“The Island of the Dead" by
Rachmaninoff.

Floyd Slotterback, baritone,
with Clara Denny, piano, will
perform Sunday night at 8 in
Herrick Chapel. The program
will consist of two arias,
“Shall I in Mamre's Fertile
Plain" from “Joshua", by

The Alvin Ailey Dancers, a black dance troupe, will
perform at Grinnell Saturday, February 27 at 8 p.m.
and 9:30 in Roberts. Tickets may be obtained at the
Forum desk on Wednesday and Thursday.

Ellen reported three basic
changes in Oiba since the res
volution. First of all, a sense
of national unity existed. This
was evident from the workers
in the fields, many ofwhom had
come from surrounding towns
to help. Doctors, lawyers,and
teachers worked along side
farmers to harvest the largest
crop of cane in Cuban history.

Second, women had gained a
more equal position in society.
Though they still enjoyed
maintaining their physical
appearances, they had been
given the right to work, learn,
and share in society along
with their men.

Finally, there has been a
general increase in the Stand‘
ard of living for the majority
of the population. The entire
population has access to edu-
cation, utilities, clothing, food
and even such luxuries as
beauty parlors.

Ellen summed up her exper-
ience as ”the most tremendr
ous of my life." She further
stated, ”I never worked so
hard before, andnever thought
i could stand it. But working
with other people for the come
mon good gave everyone the
energy to overcome the fati—
gue, pain, and exhaustian that
accompanied suchheavy work.
Through such hard work and
common ideals, the Cuban
people have been able to
bring up their standard oflivr
ing and form a stable social
structure."

Recitals

Handel, and "His Sceptre is
the Rod" from ”The Occasr
ional Oratorio", also by Han-
del. Three songs by Gabriel
Faure and three songs by
Claude Debussy will follow,
with Robert Schumann's "Lids
derkreis” ending the perfor-
mance.

Watercolor Exhibit Features
Several Outstanding Paintings

by Ellen Schiferl

An exhibition of the Cali-
fornia National Watercolor
Society is appearing in
Shaeffer Gallery. The exhibir
tion includEs paintings ranging
from abstracts to realistic
scenes in which the medium
is used in a variety ofways.
One criticism of the show:
some of the artists have trea-
ted watercolor like oil and
have not taken advantage of
the particular properties of
watercolor. Although some of
the paintings resemble past
styles, several merit special
attention.

First is William R. Sugars
"Reservoir and Root". Sug-
ar’s roots have a compelling,
almost threatening quality
about them. The fusion of
roots into the background
lends a certain mystery to the
picture which is emphasized
by eerie light caston theirunk
of the largestroot.To easethe
contraSt between the dark
ground and lightabove, Sugars
draws a flat uneven line
through the white area. Un-
fortunately, he distracts the
eye in this crucial area by

cutting out the areas between
the plant and the background
to form a puzzle.

Explosive, vibrant forms
Chara cterize Ruth Ann Goold's
“Wood's Edge”. A harmony
of color and organic shapes
produce a unified, dynamicef~
fect that keeps the eye flour
ing throughout the picture.
Despite the immediate impact
on the eye, the effect is not
violent or harsh, but one of
positive energy.

Ralph Hulett's painting “Into
the Light" is on first sight
impressive, particularly in its
ability to evoke mood. How-
ever, although it is well con-
ceived, the theme and subject
are not particularly original.
Perhaps the painting would be
more meaningful if the figure
were omitted.

Finally, Gene Mobley's
”Tomb of Forgotten Heroes"
can best be described as
strange. Somber coloring
echoes the grim stare of the
central head. 01closeinspec-
tion, another face and a
screaming eagle an be dis-
cerned. While the message
is clear, its effectisnot dulled
by insistalce.
