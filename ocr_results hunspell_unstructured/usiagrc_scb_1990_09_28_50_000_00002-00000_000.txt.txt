president too much power, They
felt it was inappropriate for SGA to
take a stand on political on moral
issues based on majority student
vote and then present these as the
opinions of the Grinnell College
student body. One student felt that
this would be putting labels on the
college which would not be repre-
sentative of each indiVidual Grin-
nell student.

“It’s not in the interests of any
students to promote homogeneity
on this campus," said Mike Kent.

Several members of SGA
agreed. stating that SGA‘s adopt-
ingofthemajorityviewpointweuld
violate the rights of minorities on
this campus, Many students felt
that SGA‘S role should merely be a
bureaucmli one, to selcctand fund
student activities.

Others students insisted that
SGA should lake a moreactivemle
in polling and representing student

political opinion on campus.

“Ilourreprescntativesdon’tlakc

“The wholepomtofreprcscnta-

Students then discussed several
means by which to improve SGA'S
effectivenesswilhout“politicizing“
it, including using student initia-
lives more effectively, increasing

Some students have felt that
police motivation in patrolling lhe
campus is to search for underage
drinkers. Lamb disagrees.

“We’re not up there to watch
them.“ Lamb added that when 110,
licemen stop to interact with slur
dents, they are doing itout of cone
eemi'eruieirsafetyandnotwilhthc
intent to find alcohol.

Crady agreed with this sentie
merit. According to Crady, there
are two major instances in which
police will infiltrate dorms to look
for illegal substances or underaged
drinkers. The first is when there
appears to be commotion inside
one of the dormitories. Theother is
if a student calls the police with a
complaint. Crady added that the
police accord the dormitories no
special status. The hallways are
considered publicterritory. Rooms
may be searched ifthere are articles
presentwhich warrantasearch. The
campus does not have to be warned
of an oncoming police presence.

”We (the police department)
enjoy our relations wilh llle col-
lege." added Lamb.
