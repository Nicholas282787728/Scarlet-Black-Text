ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES

Varsity vs Des Moines. Reserves to Mar.
shalltnwn. Fail Handicap Meet.

This afternoon the Varsity plays
the ﬁrst college game or the season
on the home grounds against Des
Moines college. In past years the
Des Moines games have been very in-
teresting ones and the scores close and
the one this year promises to term
exceptionnotwithstanding the ”bear
stories” which have come ii‘om
both camps ‘

Tile home team will be seriously
handicapped by the absence item the
game of several men who are kept out
by sickness or injury. Turner is suf-
rerlng from trichina poisoning. Flar-
agan is nursing a bad knee. Campbell,
who was hurt in the East High game
willbeused and it is very probable
that Bleamaster will not play as ho is
troubled with a stiiI knee, and Hamil-
ton is taking no chances with his crip—
ples but trying to get them incon-
dltien for the Drake game.

The Des Moines team arrived in the
city this morning and are a. tit looking
bunch notwithstanding the fact that
they have left Moyel', Elliott and sev-
eral other oi their good men at
home with injuries. The squad of
sixteen men is‘ in charge of Capt.
Corey and Coach Sherman, an old
Indiana player. .

The game will be called at 3 o‘clock,
The following willolliclate: Referee,
Byres: umpire, Guile; head linesman,

- Campbell, Des Moines.

The Reserve squad left on the early
morning train for Marshalltown
Where they meet the High School
team of that plaoe this afternoon.
The two teams played an interesting
game last week, and with Marshall»
town on her home grounds, an even
closer contest may be expected. The
Reserve team is strengthened this
Week by the addition of Loos, ’09, an
old Beloit man who |is ineligible
ier Varsity and has only gotten out
this Week. The men who went are:
Clark, Hull, Miller, Long, Orvls, Ev.
Ins, Hammond, Carter, Morrison,
Laos, Muir, MacEachron, Runkle and
Lyman. A. L. Risser, ’08, accom-

panied the team as an oriiclal.

This aiternoon also occurs the an
nual handicap meet, which will begin
at 2 o‘clock and be run or: as rapidly
as possible. in connection with this
the Glass Relay races will also be run.
This icarure or athletics has not been
so well supported as usual this year,
due, mainly, to the large number or
new men who are tying out ior root»
hat, but the list oi entries. while
small is of excellent quality.

FRIDAY MORNING CHAPEL.

The Friday chapel exercises were
conducted by President Main. He
ﬁrst impressed upon the students
that the nurnose of the Friday chapel
talk was not to be a formal address
nor a sermon but an informal talk on
matters of common interest The
su him of the address was ”Freedom”.
The aim or the college is to allow each
student the largest amount or in
dividual ireedom that is possible and
yet preserve the ideals and the tradi-
tions 0! the college. VVlth the in-
croaseln attendance and the new
buildings the problems of ill“. college
are beinK constantly enlarged and
chlelamong these is the chapel st-
venrlance. Iowa College stands for
voluntary chapel attendance. For
manyyearsthls policy has been fol-
lowed with very good results, but Pre-
sident Main stated that with our new
chapel the attendance had not been
what it ought tn be The advisability
oi changing the chapel hour to 1‘2
o’clock was suggested as a possible
means'of improving the situation.
The opportunity or gathering as one
body every morning is a privilege-
which every student ought. to cherish

as one of best things or college life.
Many graduates have given expression

of the great influence and enobllng
power or the chapel exercises in their
after years,
