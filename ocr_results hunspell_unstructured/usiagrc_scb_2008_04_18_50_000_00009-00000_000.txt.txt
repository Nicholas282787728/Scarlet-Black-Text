uch has been said about the United Church of
Christ in recent weeks, much of it hurtful for
many in our country, including members of the
Trinity UCC in Chicago. That is Why we are
eager to share the broad and diverse story of
the United Church of Christ, one that we cel-
ebrate.

With all Christians, we rest in God’s amazing

grace and hear God’s voice in the words of
Scripture. Yet, the UCC is unique to some because we do not
require uniformity of belief. We are a church of open ideas,
extravagant welcome and evangelical courage,

Our passion for democracy extends to both government and
church, where decison-making rests within each congregation.
We support liberty in our pulpits, just as we afﬁrm the indi—
vidual conscience of our 1.2-million members to agree, dis-
agree, and wrestle with life’s biggest questions in a spirit of
love.

Our story is this nation’s story. We are the people who arrived
in the New World on the Mayflower. More than 600 of our
5,700 congregations were formed before 1776. Eleven signers
of the Declaration of Independence were members of UCC pre-
decessor bodies.

As early abolitionists, we came to the aid of the Amistad cap-
tives and founded hundreds of schools across the South after
the Civil War We were the first mainline church to ordain an
African American (1785), a woman (1853) and an openly gay
pastor (1972). We were also the first to form a foreign mission
society (1810). Our multi—ethnic membership includes persons
from every immigrant group, as well as native peoples and
descendents of freed slaves.

Our unity is not dependent upon uniform agreement, but in
our shared allegiance to Jesus Christ. Ours is a risk-taking
church, because ours is a risk' taking God.

God is still speaking, ®

on chncsday, April 23, Stars otthc Lid will psttonn in
SchringrLcwis Conccrt Hall,

Thc long-time collaborators Brian McBridc and Adam
VViltzic arr largely rccognizcd as thc ptcnucr amhicnt music
group working today. Ivo Watts—Russell, ths toundcr otthc in-
dtc lahcl 4AD, has stated his belief that the group’s members
“arc making (ht: most important music orthc 21st ccntuty,”

For first»timc lislcncts, it tnighr not be readily itppatcnt why
the subtle wells and contractions of the pdir’s music should
warrant such strong praisc. Ambient pioneer Brian Eno deﬁnes
the gent: as music that can "accommodatc many levels of he
tening attention without cnforcing one in pnrriculnr,"rtnd Stars
ofthc Lid’s mustc doesjust that.

lfyou wish to usc it to create a worm and tmnquil rumor
sphcrc, wondcrtully conducivc to studying, it will not resist, But
if you instcod choose to Lie on your bed, close your oycs, and
gtvc their music your full attention, it will toward you with an
experience as emotionally nch and tommunicariyo as can be
provided by any genre otmusic.

Stars of thc Lid have made their considerable reputation
on their skill at selection and discernment. In their work cvcry
sound has its plucc and function,

Attor a tow minutcs otclosc engagement with their music,
your sensitivity will adjust to tho group's rcstraincd palatc and
small shifts in sound will take on grant emotional resonance;
you Will ﬁnd yourself enthralled by our nots’s slow fade into
silcncc,

sound implausrhlc? I would cncourogc you to try it out tor
youtsclton wcdncsday night.

Christophcr Willits will be opening with his work using
proctsscd guitar, and projected visuals likely to be as scusitivc
and thoughtful as man music will accompany stars ottho Lid's
performance.

And if you do make it to tho show,t recommend spending
at lcast a {cw minutcs torsalung tho provided visuals and, in
the spirit ofrlic group's name, ntrcnding to what thc pair calls
"your own pcrsonal cinema," thc space bctwccn youl eyes and
their lids.
