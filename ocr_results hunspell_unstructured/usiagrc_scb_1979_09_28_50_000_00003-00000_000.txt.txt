Era of scarcity— part two

“The era of scarcityz” a convenient catch-phrase that sums up
the historical epoch we are now entering. Let's face it, the days

of cheap, abundant fuel are over. OPEC may have speeded
things up a bit, but our past energy consumption habits dictated

that such an era was inevitable,

The effects of decreased fuel supplies cannot be ignored.
Even in the quiet, pastoral setting of Grinnell Collegerra place
that often escapes the harsh realities of the world-one cannot
hide from the era of scarcity.

Last spring, the 5&8 took an indepth look at the ramifications
of living in a world of decreased fuel supplies. This issue, we
again return to the energy problem, though now sharpening the
focus on the Grinnell community. .

Within the next months and years, the realities of the energy
situation will play heavily in major decisions about the future of
the college. The components of these considerations, and the
ideas being considered, make for interesting reading.
