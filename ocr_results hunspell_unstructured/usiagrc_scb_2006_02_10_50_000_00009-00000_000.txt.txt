intervene to stop genocide in Sudan

This week’s Rosenﬁeld symposlllm on genocide raises a pa»
rennltllly reoccurring dilemma ofAmerican foreign policy in the
post Cold War cm: should we intervene to stop extreme human
rights violations that occur within sovereign states?

The most pressing case is the potential genocid in the Darfur
iegion of SudanTherc an Arab in' do with implicit government
sllppolt hrs ravaged the local population, killing (ens oirhousrnds
and forcing nvo million to ﬂee their homes. Currently. the Arri—
can Union force in the region is too weak to intervene against the

militia. Some think that a larger force ofwcll-equippcd military

forces—perhaps under the UN. mantlkcould stave off a par
tcntlal genocide in the region Many would argue that. with the
possibility for success, it is both it mural necessity and it is in its
national interest for the U. S. to prevent further mass bloodshed' in
Darfur through force.

First, the argument for the
moral ml'i'etliltn of a massive
peacekeeping mission is busi—
cally sound: if we agree to the
inherent value of human life,'
and many human Lives are in
danger. it isjust to act with vio»
lence to protect those individua
315 against those wishing them
harm. However, assuming that
moral action is deﬁned by the
values ofindividuals and groups
who act. to claim that U.S. ins
tervenr'ion in Darfur is a moral
necessity is an impractical view
of morality .Such a claim as»

sumcs that the preservation on human life in Darfur l5 ofgrcater
value to Americans than other possible conflicting valuesisuch
as national strength through mulntuinlng ﬁscal discipline in gov-
ernment. While many agree with this assumed principle, others
do not. and many it") ambivalent as evidenced by our confused
reactions to humanitarian crises in other countries. All this tells us
is that we are under no moral imperative to intervene to prevent
mass murder.

Second. to claim that intervention in Sudan is compatible with
national interests requires nctlrrsupcrhumlln rhetorical agility. A

Asians don’t look the same

There are mrny times when l srlll wonder what
makes people different.Yes,some cfus have reached it
place where we no longer care about race und/or ell-r
n'ic origin of others. yet we are still able to distiguish
one person from another one. Let‘s say for instance:
you would be able to distinguish Britney Spears from
Christina Aguilcra, or Salim Hayek from Jennifer
Lopez. right? Ofcoursc, this would not happen if you
had been hiding under a rock for all your life ls that
why I want to point our to you that Korean Japanese,
Chinese and Hawaiian people do NOT look rhe
same It' is still bothering me the fact that you can ac-
cuse someone. and when they ask you to give a name,
all you do' is look rtr StalkerNet and choose from a
