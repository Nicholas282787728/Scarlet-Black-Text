Cardinals’ bandwagon and Jordan’s gambling habits

Nobody needs to tell you who to root for on super Bowl
sunday. ltyou have any sort othcatt, any feelings orsentimen-
tality when it comes to sports, yon will know who to cheer on,
Unless you were born loving Andy van Slyke you will be root-
ing for [he Buzzsaw that is the Arizona cardinals ltyou didn't
grow up a Steelers ran and you are jumping on their bandwagon
I just have a few questions to ask you. Did you root for Ihe
Hawks? Did you cry when the Russians lost? Are you sexually
aroused when someone screams “get him a body bag, yeahl"?
Where do you keep your Claude Lemieiix autographed puck.>
Do you love Gunner Stahl? (Did you really think I was going
to let this go on without iet'eiencing the Mighty Ducks at least
twice?) Have you no decency?

This might be a bit haish,bur the Caldinals are an CXUCl‘nt’
ly likable team. Laiiy Fitzgerald has already had the gieatcst
postseason otany wide receiver ever, the Arizona defense is cie»
ating excitement through turnovers, and, I might be the only
one, but 1 want to see Edgeriin James get a legitimate ting. To
think that just seven weeks ago Tarvatis jackson was scotch-
ing them for tour touchdowns. The same Tarvatis jacksou that,
while playing the Eagles, got body slammed with such violent
force that the young quarterback was so addled the next drive
he led the Vikings downﬂeld for a touchdown, Poor thingihe
didn't know what he was doing.

Now that I’ve decided who you're going to root for. it's imr

' celebrate

pottant that you aie ahead ofthe curve on the most enteitain-
ing aspeet or~the game: prop bets. sure you ean wager money
on prop bets throughout the season, but that would require a
gambling addiction so severe youd have to serve an 18 - month
super secret suspension. so kick back and relax because I’m not
finished here until I've made my classic ironclad predictions
and you've lost copious amounts otrnoney.

Winner of the coin toss:Arizona Cardinals
it's fairly widely known that the Cardinals have never
lost a coin toss while being more than ﬁve point underdogs,
away from home at a stadium that features a pirate ship while
the wind is blowing between 10 and 20 miles per hour from
a non-cardinal direction And what, pray tell, is the National
Weather service predicting? That's right, the winds going to
be blowing out ofrhc Northeast at 13 MPH. Locke
