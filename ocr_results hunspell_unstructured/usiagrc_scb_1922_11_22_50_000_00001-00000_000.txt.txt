The Pioneers suffered defeat at the
hands of Drake last Saturday by c.
score of 214). The game, which was
the last for the Pioneers this season.
was featured by long runs on the
part of both teams, Grinnell was out-
played by her ancient rivals in the
ﬁrst and third and last quarters, Drake
securing a touchdown in each of these
periods.

The Pioneers lost their best chance
to score in the second quarter when
Critchctt returned 'a punt sixty-ﬁve
yards to the Drake twelvc yard line.
Here a fumble proved costly and
Drake forced the ball into safer terri-
tor-y.

Crinnell received the ﬁrst kicksuff.
and after printing to Drake the latter
marched down the ﬁeld for the ﬁrst
touchdown in thc ﬁrst five minutes of
play. lifter that the Pioneers braced
themselves and battled evenly with the
Bulldogs for the remainder of the
half, having a slight advantage in the
second quarter.

Ames Wins Activity Clip at Sigma
Delta Chi Convention—Don
Clank Alumni Sec.

The G nnell chapter of Sigmal
Delta Chi ranked ﬁfth in the chapter
activity contest at ilic eighth national
convention of the fraternity hold at
Manhattan, Kansas, last week, Amcs
won the cup, which was awarded to
the most active chapter. North
Dakota was rated second. Michigan
third, and Indiana fourth. Oklahoma.
Cornell Unive sily and Marquette Uni»
rcrsity received honorablo mention.
The ranking of Crinnell is highly
satisfactory to the local chapter,
since there arc thirty-eight chaptcrs

of the fraternity, located in the‘ lead-p

ing colleges and universities of the
country, and all the other ranking
Chapters in the contest were in the
university class.

The points upon which the Chap-
ters were judged were: acti as fol-
the promotion of jnumalistic interest
outside the immediate college or

the general public. The occasion is
the big allscollege carnival being put
on by the r. M. and Y. W. c. As. A
variety of novel entertainments,i
booths, features and cllts are promised
by the committee in charge.

While it is exceedingly difficult to
learn anything deﬁnite as to the ar-
rangements for the evening, one hit
of information has slipped out There
will he a post office, the accommoda-
tions of which will be most exception—
e1 at remarkably low prices. No charge
for postage will be over ﬁve cents.
Those attending the carnival are his
structcd to Write letters, special dc-,
liverics and telegrams, address aDdL
stamp them. Packages of all sizes will
likewise be personally delivered by
the messengers especially provided for
that purpose.

it is suggested that one might write
to a girl for a. oats—a girl whom one,
has admired but doesn't know very‘
well. You might iot a friendly line
,to your pet prof on any little friendly
subject. You might write to your room
mate and tell him just what you think
of him. He might like it for a permit—
vnsnt souvcnir. There is a severe pen~
ally for forging names, although the
letters nocd not he signed.

a member of the committee told usl
,the following: "Hero is another ad—1
‘Lvantage. Suppose you have an article
which you borrowed so long ago mat
'you lack the courage to return it.
‘The solution is easy. Mail it back on
Saturday evening. Perhaps your best,

cumstanccs you might give her ani
Arrow collar just your size so she
could loan it to you. The collar
would thus sciwc a double purpose."
We also heard the following:

"You will never recognize
handsome curves of that gymnasium
when you slip surreptitiously within
those massive portals upon that Sat—L
urolay night. Nut-stained gypsies
will occupy one secluded nook and
banners will hire within those sccklng

those unnerved by the lorecasted
shadows in their lives, diverse re~
frcshmcnts will be served. Out of
consideration for those so unused to
plain confection, chop suey and other
exotic foods will be prepared.

“As for the dramatic attractions of
the evening, wellilllese will so sur—
pass all of the takers of Barnum and
Bailey that the latter have rciircd in—
to hibernation. There will be clowns
on the outside, garbling and gabbling

Says Pragmatism Brings Positive
Justiﬁcation for Belief in
Purpose of World.

lSEOOND LECTURE WAS 0N
“TYPES OF PHILOSOPHY”

Professor Hocking S_ays That the
Philosophy of Naturalism is
’ Very Inadequate.

Pragmatism was the subject of the
third chapel lecture by Prof. William
Ernest Hocking, Harvard Exchange
professor, in Pierrick Chapel Monday
morning.

Professor Hooking defined Prams-
tism as the doctn'ne that we adopt
our beliefs on the grounds of their
efficiency. He then went on to point
out the negative side of this subject
as presented in the philosophies of
Naturalism and Agnosticism which
were considered in an earlier lecture!

in presenting the positive side of
Pragmatism, Professor Hocking called
attention to the fact that beliefs can-
not alwuys he proved by test. Again
suspension of judgement defeats its
own purpose because the adoption of
a belief is sometimes the means of
determining its tmth. in the ﬁnal
.analysis scientiﬁc ideas are very simi-
lar to religious and moral ideas since
there is no absolute proof that nature
is uniform. In the light of these facts
the Pragmatlsts would go slow in on
cluding purpose and God from the uni-
vei-sc as the philosophy of Naturalism
has attempted to do.

According to Professor Hocking,
‘there are three tests of truth which
are the basis of the Pragmatic be»
Ilief. These are veriﬁcation by sense,
'consistency. and utility. He dwelt up-
on the utility test which holds, if the
belief in God gives comfort, security

‘president Lee A. White, both of the
Detroit Ncws. Mr. Player is consider-
cd_onc of the best journalists and
ahlsst stylists in the country and

Teams Now Organizing and Sched.
ule for Practice on Floor Has
Been Draw-n Up.

‘ With the close of the football season
at Drake last Saturday, the Grinncll
sport fans are commenting on the pros—
pects of Elle basketball season, which
is to be initiated by the class. series
on or about December fourth. Con-—

supremacy of the classes and this year
promises to ho no excoption,to the
rule.

The Senior and Junior classes are
the favorites in this year’s contests by
reason of their victories of former
years, although the class of '25 may
figure in the ﬁnal results. Their,
strength, however, is as yet an
unknown quantity. The sophomores
are not considered as especially
strong because of the failure of sev-
eral of their best performers to re-‘
turn to school. A schedule has been
posted of the periods in which the
respective classes may have the gym
floor for practice. .Thc freshmen
have the floor from 3:05 until moor
p. m,, tho sophomores from 4:00 to
4:40, thc‘ juniors from 4:40 to 5:15 and
the seniors from 5:15 to 5:50. l

The material from which the seniorsl
have to draw is found in Whitchill,
Fearing, Janssen, Datesman, Ty Smith
and Watson. The Juniors have an
abundance of material in Benz, Crit-
chctt, McLain, Baker, Johnston,
Prelim, Stock, Edwards and Cushman.

The sopliomorc team will be picked
from Gclvin, Winter, Taylor, Bunnell,
hi. Bogs, and Wilson. The promising
men of the freshman class are un<
known now but a line on thclr ma—
terial may be gained before the ser—
ies commence.
