M. Brown Reads
‘Bighead’ Paper
at Sunday Club

“Can America create a distinctive
culture?, was the subject of dis»
cussion at the meeting of the Sunday
Evening club, held on the second
floor of the Associations building
at 7:30 pm. Sunday.

The discussion was led by Manuel
Brown. who introduced the topic by
reading the paper of a ficticious
character, Professor Bighead of the
University of Absolute Knowledge,
Pekin, china, The paper was a retros
spective survey of the professor’s
work in which he criticized various
phases of contemporary life and
was supposedly written 5,000 years
A.T. (after Technucl‘acy), looking
back on present times.

Prof. Bighead's paper on icizcd the
”Ancient American" Civilization ad-
versely as to lack of freedom of op.
pm‘tunlty, lack of scientific politi
and lock of rational economy.

Some of the conclusions reached
by the 35 persons present, during the
discussion, were the following: “The
present dominance of the Sex motif
in literature will lend to a more
wholesome attitude toward sex.
“From 1929 onward thc American
culture will be-decrcosingly a burn
ncss man's civilization”; and “Sci-
ence should be socialized more than
it has in the past."

Marion Frickcn, ex~’32, of Grundy
Center was recently named private
secretary to Mrs. Alex Miller, SCCI‘EV
tary of state, She is employed in Mrs.
