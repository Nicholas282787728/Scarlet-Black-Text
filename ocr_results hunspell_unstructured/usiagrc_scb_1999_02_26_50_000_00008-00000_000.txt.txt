Get an inside view of the candidates. so I can vote wisely.

Senator (Dibble Hall): .

committee work has provided me with a knowledge of Grinnell students academic concerns. whereas being a
Senator has forced me to consider students needs outside the classroom. I have learned that Grinnell is a community of
bright and ambitious individuals who have diverse, and perhaps opposing, views on the world. One of my goals as President
would be to encourage diversity of thought among Grinnell students and, at the same time, inspire solidarity and conﬁdence
in the community as a whole.

 

', in a world that values only the final product, we often lose track of the process. Last year. i got my ass kicked and
began seif-medicating. .
i thought winning was the only value in the whole thing. This year my candidacy is all about the act cfmnning for SGA
President. However, it will not be in an intelligent artsy way. In all honesty. I would not be perfect for the job because I have
more pressing things in my life. Like painting. Not that i do not value or respect the people here. but I can'see that there
may better people for the job. Myself as the President wouldn't help me much in life, and most importantly it wouldn’t help
you. 50. sit back and Watch the Candidates parading around and see who really wants thejob. With any luck. the best Will
rise to the top, and I will have a good time being right in the middle of it.

slrccessfully carry out the responsibilities ofthis position. i

t In my capacity as International Strident Organization President, 9899, I have had the chance to work on a number of
issues that affect the campus. 1 am an active member ofthe SPACE committee, which deals with the issue ofMulii.Cultuial
Space on campus, and represented 150 in the DiVCO/SGA forum. I also conducted a retreat with the ISO cabinet where we
discussed the mission statement ofISo, goals to be accomplished and what we felt bad to be done to improve 150. Some of
the goals that we discussed included increasing awareness and promoting the cultures of International Students in Grinnell,
developing relations with the town and increasing publicity oflso events on campus. We met all these goals this year. We

working with the lniemational Student Organization of Grinnell High School and hope to cooperate with them on a larger

scale in the near future. As President 1 have worked with the cabinet to hold a number of successful all campus events that
dealt with international issues or had international themes. i helped organize participation in the annual “Students for
international .ynderstandjng pnference", that brings together smpelrtg from different colleges in town. As the male Over-
night l-tost Coordinator I hav worked closely with Admissiorrs grid the College Administration, giving me a good under-
standing of how these sections of the college function.. V’ .. l ' ‘t ‘ i l

9 Being a member ofa variety of campus organizations and groups such as ISO, ASIA, son, CBS, Chalutzim, the UC
Corps, the Grinnell Singers, and VISA, I feel that i would be able to represent a large section of the campus community
effectively.

‘ As a candidate there are a number ofissues that I feel need to be dealt with:

Finance Commirte . .

My work on the finance committee has taught me about the details of Student Government. As a member of this
committee, I realize that successful management of SGA’s ﬁnances determines the type and number of activities available to
students. I have also learned about the expectations and regulations set forth in the SGA constitution that the President is
obligated to uphold.

Who am 17 I am a junior who just returned from a semester abroad in Costa Rica & Belize with the tCADS program. I am an
excellent yo-yoer. and am currently teaching the Yo-yoing for Pleasure ExCo class for the second time. I enjoy singing with
the Grinncll Singers. and my newest hobby is scuba diving. Dreams and dreaming, panioularly lucid dreaming, have
fascinated me for years; lately I've been dreaming about the Caribbean a lot. 1 am in the process ofdeclaring a Technology at
Culture independent major, and one of my primary academic interests is the ethics of technology. l’ve had many relevant
experiences to prepare me to be SGA president, and possess the personal qualities to be effective in that role. Currently I am
the senator of Cleveland Hall, and am serving on the Student Academic Computing Committee. My sophomore year at
Grinnell i coordinated the VISA program, requiring patience, perseverance, and organizational skills to house all the
pmspcctives; part of my role was also to act as a liaison between the admissions staff and the stude'r'rts.'A few years'back,1
was president ofmy high school and led a project where we rewrote the student council constitution to further empower the
student body. 1 am diplomatic, easy—going, and approachable, and welcome you to talk to me at any time about SGA or
whatever...l live on Cleveland second floor, room 22 lo, and my phone number is x3455.

o, Increasing Diversity and Multicultural Awareness within and outside the Grinnell College Community.
I believe that the college needs to use all the resources available in order to increase diversity both within the
Student Body as well as the Faculty. Globalization ofthe curriculum and an increase in the retention rate of
multi-cultuml students are also issues that need to be addressed.

vision: As SGA president, i want to ﬁght apathy, try to get more voices involved in campus issues, and encourage more
community at Grinnell. 1 hope to participate in and critically consider the structure ofSGA, searching for ways to incorporate
a more uniﬁed student voice into the future of the college. Why in a college largely critical oftraditronrl strucnrres of
govemrnent does every student group and all campus event have to be sanctioned by the bureaucracy ofSGA, and why does
SGA model our own democratic system? Utilizing technology in positive ways, i would like to create dynamic message
bonds easily accessible on the web for discussion of campus issues, speculation on the future, and the public expression of
all sordent voices. To achieve positive, student—centered change, it is also important to address the increasing communication
split between the trustees and that ofthe students One goal 1 have as SGA president next year is to create a student trustee
position, which would contribute to more effective studenvtrustee communication. Academically. Grinnell should not be
afraid to stray from the traditional canon...or the conﬁnes ofthe campus. increased consultation with students should help .
guide the shape of new academic programs. In particular, I think programs in intematronal relations should be expanded, as
should opportunities to engage in ﬁeld practice in the community and the world. In order to help students more effectively
face the future, the recruitment of increasingly diverse faculty should be pursued 7 it is important that we take steps to
reduce class sizes and instill in students knowledge informed from a variety of perspectives. Internships and class trips. to
apply what is teamed in Grinnell to the actual world, should be encouraged and further funded. The recent fund for excel-
lence program to enrich the CDO has made steps, but more resources are needed. Emerging into the new millennium, I think
it is important to cultivate a coherent, creative community at Grinnell that is not afraid to push the limits and imagine new
possibilities.

Continuing Advancement ofthe Career Development Ofﬁce.
This past year a lot of work has gone into developing the CDO as a better resource for students studying in
Grinnell College, I intend to continue the work and further develop the CDO as i feel that it is one of the most
valuable resources that Grinnell College has to offer.

Student Publications and Radio Communications.
1 hope to support SPARC and assist it in meeting its needs.

Computing Priorities.
1 intend to address the difficulties that the campus is facing regarding computers and availability ofprinters,
computing staff, etc. As a UC l have had direct experience with GCCS and the unavailability of staff to respond
promptly to higher—level computer difficulties. ,

Promoting Town-Gown Relations. .
Promoting relations with the Grinnell Community is a major issue. There is a lot that Grinnell College can give (it
town and vice Velsa. The [own needs to be made more aware of the resources available to them through the college “III!" ill VIII! llllll III III I“ lllﬂl'lllﬂl' II IIIO Ill ﬂllfcha

Thank you for considering my candidacy for this position.

offices on campus. In my sophomore year, I served as the Student Servlces Coordrnaeor on the son cabinet. ln that. role, I learned the importance of the cabinet as a cooperative unit, as
well as the procedures that seat has used in the past. 111 working with the administration and community co accomplish goals efficiently. l marnrained a highly organized and effective
program of student services. and improved the communicacron between son and other service enelcles on campus and in the community. 1 also founded the College's Friends of Literacy
program. recognizing the need for a comprehensive program of service in this area. I am also familiar with SPARC, and l have co-edleed The Freehand Press for three semesters. where l
have been responsible for the Elnancial marcers, Each of these experiences has exposed me to a variety of aspects of the workings of campus organazaeions as well as the variety of
qualities needed in a leadership position of ehe magnitude of Presldent. I have participated in several committees and focus groups on campus as well, and whenever I have had a complaint
about: something on campus. I have taken the crme to investigate and improve the slcuaeion whenever possible. I also like making creative conerrbuelons to the campus Conuuunltyi such as
designing the decoratlve scheme for Sprlng Waltz lasc year. aach of these experiences enhanced my ability to serve in the role of Presrdent, a job which requires knowledge of the lnner-
workings of sch. a dedication to servrce and active improvement. organizational and Communication skills. and the creacrvlcy to find new ways to utilize our syscem so that our goals wlll

reach frulelon.
Now that: I have shared with the campu

the Grit-men community: > ‘
dusnx'n; The success of the future depends upon the stablllty of the past. This statement is especially true of German College. Some lssues do hoe currently recelve much campus-

wide decentson, such as exisLlng programs and the Space lssue. true they are nonetheless vital to cut fueure. Ie ls still lmportai-it. that SGA, and students in general, continue to be
involved in the Space process to make sure the produce wlll compleeely meet the needs of the students, and will address the need for multiculeural space thoroughly. I will ensure that: our
connecelons and eonerlbutions co the Space process on campus are maintained. We also. as a campus. seem to be in a transition perlod in Grinnell's history. We are experienClng both
growth and change as a campus, espeClally this year with the new college president: and [he focuson increasing our dlselncelon as a top liberal arts college. My role in this eransrelon
will be to see that. it takes place as smooehly as possible. and wiehoue umuc- u-y changes.
mammal-roll: Part. of every SGA Presidene's agenda is always the improvement. of communication on campus. Along chose llnes, ehere are several areas I wane to work on intensively next
year. The firs: ls seudent Affairs. It: seems co the char ehere are many complaines aboue the relationship beeween ehrs offlce and students on campus, and I want to ensure that they hear
what the students are reporting, so that they know how students are feeling about: ehelr interactions with studene Affairs and can make necessary improvements. A syseem of this narure ls
lmpexaesve, since failures in the area of seudertt life can have disastrous consequences, both for lndividuals and the college’s future. Thls strategy will be effeCtlve-for other offices
on campus as'well. second. I want students to be more aware of changes that occur on campus, especially regardlng the Career Development office. - I support lrtcreased finances and staff
for ehls office as well, so thae the students can transaelon into che job markee with as much support. as possible, Third. I would like to examine ways tn Whlch communicaelon becween
studene groups on Campus Carl unify our efforts on similar goals. Finally, I feel chat: SPARC is in need of asslseance from SSA, been financlally and to finding ways he make it more
accountable co the campus Community. . ’
'DIVBRSITY: Diversfey is an imperative part of crihnell's conelnued success. I am Cmiutlitted eo che issues of dlversity and acceptance on campus. and I seand strongly agalnse [he dxxect
