Iowa Isn't Heaven, But There's No Place on Earth Like It

By Howard B Horn

INNELLhasbeenhaunted
by a running joke‘about
Iowa. It's roots stem from

the movie Field of Dreams.
“Shoeless” Joe Jackson, after arrivr
ing on the baseball diamond in the
corn field, asks Kevin Kostner’s
character, “Is this heaven?” The
answer, “No, it’s Iowa." This con
versation has led Grinnellians tojoke
that Iowa is heaven. The Grinttell
Debating Union even sponsored a
debate last year on the issue.

Let's face it; there isn't much in
Iowa. Outsitle ofa few moderately
sized cities, Iowa is some scattered
small towns and an overabundance
of farmland (and in the summer of
1993,watcr). Therearen'tany world
class citics, famous tourist atLran

lions, or even significant museums.
Instead Iowa is famous for corn.
Sounds really boring, doesn’t it?

Grinnell College is unique in
the fact that most students are not
originally from Iowa. We all have
different perspective based on our
upbringing in our own little comer
of the world. Despite our varied
upbringings,weshould allbeablcto
see that Iowa is a special and won-
dcrtut place.

I think I first realized about the
unique and wonderful characteris-
ticsoflowtithefirsttimelhadtopay
by check in Iowa. I went to the
register. wrote out a check and then
roﬂcxivcly reached for my wallet. I
asked the nice old lady manning the
counter, what form of identification
she would need to cash the check.
She told me, “All I need is your

phone number." “What?" I ex-
claimed in complete surprise. “This
is an out of state check. You don‘t
needmydriver'slicense,creditcard,
bloodtype,antlanomfromthepresir
dentofmybank explaining my com»
plete credit history?" “No,“ she re-
plied,“all I need is yourphonenuln»
bet.”

Something clicked inside of me
at this point. There is definitely
somethingdifferentaboutthisplace.
An aspect of human nature that I
thoughtwasuniversal was suddenly
shattered. In Iowa, it is okay to trust.

Everywhere else I have been,
therewerepeoplewhowouldn'tgive
a second thought to cheating their
neighbor. They don‘t care who the
step on in order to reach their goals.
And why not? Everyone isjust one
of an endless sea of people. There

arejust too many faces to remember
even a small percentage of them.
Those who want to do whatever they
feel like doing can do so under the
disguise of anonymity. Robbing
banks isn’tthaidit‘licult todo. After
all,Lhedescriptionoftherobberprob-
ably matches a large percent of the
population.

In Iowa, the population is more
spread out, Small town and rural
areas are a way of life. People lose
theiranonymity. This mightaetasa
deterrent for people. Or maybe
people don’t want to step on their
neighbors because their neighbor is
someone they know. People would
no longer be cheating a neighbor;
it’d be more like cheating a friend.

Losing anonymity |S really a
good thing. Itgives you an identity.
You feel like Someone. You are no

The Death of Wisconsin 3 Dairyland?

By Tanya Haney

OPLE from Wisconsin know
Film, unless they are antique
dealers searching for farm aue»
tions or vacationers looking for peace,
quiet, and a place to put their motor-
boats in the water, Chicagoans tend to
be unaware of events in the Badger
state. We eat fried cheese curds and
drink beer, and they eatPoIish sausage
antl drink beer. [was surprised, then,
to see that Wisconsin made the front
page of my house mate’s Chicago
Tribune this week, It seems news was
releasedLlialWisconsitt'sclaimtofame
as “America's Dairyland” has now
been relinquished tosunny California,
probably due to Wisconsin's failure to
adopt California's style of largcscctle
factory farming. InastyletypicalofAI
Capone and Old Lady Leary‘scow (as
far as I can determine the two most
farnousrcsidentsofChieago),oneedi-
torial writer first claimed to sympa»
thize with Wisconsin residents, then
proceeded to deal them the harshest
blow imaginable by maintaining that
Wisconsin's attempts to cling to its
family farms were ”reactionary."
Now,pleasedon’tmisunderstarid
myposition on Chicago; alterall. more
Wisconsinites root for the Cubs than
the Brewers (who could blame us?
Don‘t even get me started on the
Packers . , .), and it’s nice to have
touriSis. On theothcr hand, I think that
Wisconsin would do well not to take
the route suggested by the Tribune ,
that is, to follow in Califomia‘s footy
steps. RumlWisconsin already under
stands that family farming is an eco-
nomic struggle in this age ofindustritil
farming; farmers whose sole goal is to

remain competitive with the larger
dairy industry have already begun to
incorporate use of BGI-I (a controverr
sial hormone that greatly increases
milk production in cows) into their
management plans. Many rural Wisr
consinites, however, are opposed to
die institution of EGl-Irlike technol—
ogy in our state, not because we are
opposed to technology itself but be
cause technologies designed for mass
production of crops continue to do
stroy family farming as we know it.
We have already seen our communi-
ties lose their downtown businesses
duringtliefanncrisis;wchiivcalready
seen people desperate to take on ajob
tit Wall/tart to supplement meir inr
coines,to save their farms, Thcloss of
family Iarmsnotonlypumhelanners
out ofajob, it destroys communities
Imagine a thousand Grinnells losing
their farmers; nothing of rural Iowa
would be left!

So,how will Wisconsin compete

with California without destroying its
niral communities? Iimagine that we
will put moreelfori into organic farinv
ing.whichtendstoopemteonasmaller
scale, and that we willhave to increase
the level ofother non-destructive ocor
notnic activities like “rural tourism."
There mustbesomercason(otherthan
the cheap price of abandoned farm
land) why city-types from both states
are buying up country homes within a
60 mile iadtus of my hometowti in a
poor agricultural county. Maybe they
appreciatealandscapeolirout-hshing
streams (albeitpollutcd as they are by
cow manure), farm fields, and
woodlots. The point is. ifCliicagoaiis
want to vacation in the quaint little
places they know anti love, they Will
have to help encourage Wisconsin to
preserve its landscape and its psyr

longer a face in the crowd. People
know you and trust you in Iowa.
Most of America is not urban,
yet the rural and small townsoflowa
are still very unique. It has it’s own
feel,7 something that is very diffi-
cult to describe. People are gener-
ally kind in Iowa. It's not a canned
niceness: every time I see someone
express kindness, it always seems
genuinei To use a really bad anal-
ogy, Iowa is like the television bar
Cheers and we’re all Norm.
Yet,lowa is notheaven. Itlaeks
the angels singing, God, and your
grandma. But Iowa need not be
heaven. Iowa. as its own separate
entity, is pretty special by itself.
