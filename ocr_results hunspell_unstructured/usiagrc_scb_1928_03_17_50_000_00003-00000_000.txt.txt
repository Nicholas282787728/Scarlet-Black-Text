One of the leading tobacconists in Grin-
nell, Iowa, says:

"The rapid growth in the popularity of OLD
GOLD Cigarettes among the students is remark-
able. Never in my experience have I seen a new
cigarette catch on so quickly with the boys on
the campus.”

E. J. Sullivan

For a most refreshing change:

 

 

"Follow your friends and

switch to this smoother
and better cigarette”
