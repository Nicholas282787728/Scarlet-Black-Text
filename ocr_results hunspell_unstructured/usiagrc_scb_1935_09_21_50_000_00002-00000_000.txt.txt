The Parker Vac-mimic—
Invented by .1 University
Professor to replace pens

HE mazvelous new Parke! Vacu-

math: is no more like the pens of
yesterday rhon your 1935 car is like
a ‘25 model.

It’s the identical [mu you've often
said iliii someone ought to invent.

Scores ofinventors tried tkfully
250 sacloss pens were patented he.
tore Ibis miracle writer was born.
But none found n way to surmount
the mzcbanicnl faults of sqilirI-gun
pislon pumps, valves. etc.

Then a scientist at the University
of Wisconsin conceived the Vuou.
nniio, And Geo. s. Parker. world's
leading pen mukcr, agreed to do clop
it because it contained no rubllcr sac
or lever ﬁller like sueiypc pens—no
plsiuu pump as in ordinary Saclcss
pens.

That’s why Parker callinnd
DUES—guarantee the vucumuiic
MECIIANICALLY PERFECT!

Because there is nothing else like
