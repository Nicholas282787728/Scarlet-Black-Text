Luick Gains
Sixth Place

Advances Up From 10th
in Loop Scoring Race

Dumping in six f1eld goals for
12 ponts last night as he led his
team mates to a narrow victory
over the Tulsa Hurricanes
26-24, Wilbur Luick, tall red-
headed Crinnell ccnter, moved
into sixth position in the Mis-
souri Valley conference indiv1dual
scoring race. In 10 games Luick
has dumped in 33 field goals and
four free throws for a total of 70
points.

Shaw, Creighton whirlwind fol~
wa1d, continued to lead the 1 cc
with a total of 102 points scored in
10 games this season. He did not
see action last night as the Jays
were idle.

Second place in the race was
taken over by Friels, sharp shoot:
ing. Tulsa forward, who boosted
his total to 91 points with 12
points scored against Grinncll last
night. Crebaugh, Drake guard,
who had been holding second
place in the scoring race most of
the season, slipped badly Friday
when the tight Aggie defense held
him scoreless for the entire game.
His total of 84 points gives him
third place.

Dean, Grinnell guard and caps
tain, who had ranked among the
first 10 scorers all season, failed to
add to his total last night as he
was able to score only one free
throw. He now has a total of 68
points.

standings for should the Pioneers
win their two remaining games,
the Aggies tonight and Drake at
Des Moines next Friday, they will
finish the season with a. record of
eight wins and four defeats.
Undisputed Second

The Pioneres can gain undispute
ed possession of second place in
the loop, should Drake and Creigh.
ton split even in their two remain»
ing games. In spite of the fact
that Creighton chaiks up two
more victories, a two way tie for
second place would result, while
should Crinnell lose tonight or
Friday at Drake, all chances for
second place will have vanished,
with the coveted position probably
ending up in a two-way tie be-
twecn the Jays and the Bulldogs.

Odds seem to favor an Aggie
victory tonight when Coach Hank
Iba brings his 12 man squad to the
gym with the leaky roof. Each
player is as good as the next, and
the Oklahoma mentor is expected
to follow his usual method of grade
ually wearing down the opposition
by substituting fresh men through-
out the game.

star Guards

Stars of the visiting Cowpunchn
ers will be Capt. Taylor Little, all»
Missouri Valley conference guard
last season, and Merle Rousey, last
year all-valley forward, but this
year defending the back court with
Little. Both men rank well up in
the loop scoring race and are con-
sidered the backbone of the Aggie

 

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

team.

The ma. coached cagers w1ll prev
scnt height that will more than
match Grinnell’s. Both of the Ag-
gie guards tower more than six
feet, while the center posts will be
manned by Bar-ringer, who ranges
6 feet 3 inches in height, and
Charles Kalsu who measures ’
foot five. Itrucger, forward, is
the smallest man in the sta1tmg
lineup, standing on 5 feet 3 inch—
es, while his team-mate Cox
stands 5 feet 11.

The Aggies will present their
usual whirling offense, which is
reported to have baffled many of

opponents. They combine

unusual offense with tight
defensive tactics which last night
held the second high scorer in the
conference, Crebaugh of Drake,
scoreless.

“Although Iowa placed first in

he continued, "as a good share of
the boys are inexperienced.”
