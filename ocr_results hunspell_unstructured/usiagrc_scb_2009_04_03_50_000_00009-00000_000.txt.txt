Grinnellians travel to Nicaragua, help community

While mIny Grinnellians parted two weeks ago for borne
on destinations with tInrpeIIrtc wIItlreI, MIIissI Gilman 09
Aniko DrlikrMuchleck '11. Kathe Ic Gregeisen ’09, Annie
Pigott'lz, Mary Jane Giese 2, GrIrce Philipp’lZ, EvIn Pon—
der '10, and Emma Peterson 10 headed to Nicaragua where
they spent their spring brcIk experiencmg firsthInd the devel-
opment of the San Ramon community.

After an internship in San Ramon, wheie she worked with
an office of sustainable community tourism, Gilman was in-
spired to organize a return trip, this time with the company of
other Grinnellians.

Inﬂuenced by I Global Development Studies trip to CostI

, Rica with Monty Roper, Anthropology, Gilman knew that she
wanted the trip to be an experiential learning opportunity. “I
still wanted to have some sort of learning component to it.
I wanted to have a group of students go to this community
I worked in," Gilman said. “I knew I wanted us to deal with
Spanish, Global Development Studies, and Latin American
issues.’

Gilman, determined to see the trip through, set about pos-
tering and applying for frrnding for various college grants.
Although the College initially Igreed to provide funding, risk
assessors brought to the administration‘s attention the high
risk of eight unaccompanied students traveling abroad. “The
hardest part was frnding funding," Gilman ind. “Two weeks
before the trip, the college was cInceling our funding Ind the
administration, the higher ups, found out about the trip and
decided to revoke the funding that had been received.”

After contributions from President Russell K. Osgood and
his fImily, however, the trip was made Iffor-dIble, Ind therefore
possible.

once the eight students successfully made it to sIn Ra-
mon, they spent a little over I week leIrning Ibour the region‘s
economy and assisting 'In various community projects. While
the students anticipated more participation with the commu-
nity's microﬁnancc efforts, they took the advice of the com-
munity's development office and insetad learned more about
the general state of the community. “The office didn't think
this was the most beneﬁcial thing to be done with our time.
None of us wanted to force our own agenda on the organiza-
tion," Gilman said.

The students spent I good portion of their time It I cloud
forest reserve, studying the Irons economic dependence on
coffee and helping the proprietor create rest Ireas through
out the plantation for potential touristsI Students expressed

of the trip. “I had never used a machete before!" said Gregets—

sustainable tourism effort in San Ramon and working with

the students, overall, found the trip to be a rewarding and eye
opening experience. “Even though there are so many limita-
tions with I big group and short period of time, it was impor-
tant to have a taste of [the San Ramon community] and to
have other Grinnellians to share the experience with in order
to better understand complex issues going on in a community
that is trying to get out ofa rut it finds itselfin,"Gilman said.

Boozing in your p-hat with Ben Jones ’03

Grinnell native and alumnus bartends at several Grinnell watering holes, in addition to being a Statistics professor

Ben Jones is a Statistics professor who ens
joys serving alcohol. Just not at the same time.

“I have never drank before 1 pm. on the
days I have to teach,"Jones said.

The 2003 alumnus has been helping stus
dents quench their thirst since he became a bar—
tender. Beginning this semester, he’s also been
helping students learn to interpret and under
stand data sets.Jones was hired as a temporary
professor to teach Introduction to Statistics.

“I know its cliche but I have different hats,
one for teIching and one for bIItending and I
only wear one hat at a time,”Jones said.

Jones grew up in Grinnelliboth ofhis pars
ems were professors in the Math Department.
He attended Grinnell, received an undergradbr

are degree in Statistics and attended Iowa State
University for graduate school. Before he left,
however, he began working for JImes “JImbo”
Sadler’l‘anzosch ’88 in the Down Under Pub,
bartending on Saturdays.

“1 had IrctuIlly worked for Jimbo Is I bounc-
er the summer after I gmduated,"Jones said. “I
was not I very good bouncei."

Despite Jones never IcruIIly being trained as
I bII tender, Jimbo gIve him the job. Jones wIs I
good bartender Ind throughout grad school, he
continued to bartend on the weekends, driving
back to Grinnell from Ames. All of his drink-
ing expertise hIs either been picked up on the
job or cIrried over from college. His semester
IbIoId was pII-riculII-ly inforrnIrive.

“I spent I summer in the Czech Republic
Ind Ifter converting everything bIclt to dol-
lIrs it was roughly 25 cents for I pint of what
I would say is good quality micI-obrew beer,"
Jones ind. "Since then I the been drinking I
lor of good beer or snobby beer. so I would my
that I the I good knowledge ofbeer.

As Jones’ knowledge of beer and statistics
grew in his years after college, hr: started do-
ing more of both. He has tIughr nine previ-
ous sections ofIntroduction to Statistics at ISU
Ind Simpson college in IndIInolI, IowI Ind hc
stIrted working for Lon of Lonnskr's pub.

"Lon, who had I bar It Lonnski's,” Jones
said, “came into the Pub after hours and I kept
serving him drinks and that’s more or less howl
got hired as a bIrtcnder It Lonniski’s,"

When the Pub closed lIst year, Jones begIn
working I lor more for Lon. Lon also owned
Back Alley Deli and hired Jones to make sand-
wiches in addition to bartcnding. It was the

sIndwich-nrnking thIr landed Jones his job
at the College; Back Alley Dcli is attached to
Saint's Rest Coffee shop which lIIppens to be
the same place rhIt math professors Tom and
Emily Moore like to go to em their lunch—
whrch was very lucky for Jones, because he and
the Moorcs go Iva bIck.

Toni Moore likes to say that he knew Ben
Jones "since he was negative." Both Moorcs

“He popped into the house sometimes Ind
talk for an hour or so and we always had nice
chats." Moore said.

thn Moore saw that Grinnell needed a
tcmporIry statistics professor for the spring se-
mester this yeIr, hc ler Jones know.

“My wife and I like to have lunches at the
coffee shop Ind we go down there I few times I
week. lVIoorc said. [Jones] would IlIvas pop
over when the line was down to zero. so I Just
ind one dIy you know we have this position,
you think you might be interested?“

Jones was interested, and with IVIoore’s help
he was able to land his cutrentjob.

“Everyone knew him It least on a personal
level,"Moore said. “It was all conducted through
e-mail and me being It the coffee shop. Then,
foIInIlly, the deIn offered him the job.”

Jones generIlly doesn't mix his two Jobs, but
he hIs held two smdy review sessions in the
Lonnskis dining room. The Thursdays before

his last two cxanis,Jones had his students come
by Lonnski's and he would help the students
with rherr prIctice on.

“He bought us dIInks—non-Ilcoholic—
and appetizers," Toby can '12 said. “It wIs I
may laid back sinIIIIon. Ir was I lot easier thIn
going to his offrcc hours. It put me It ease."

But Jones wIsn't being I bartender then, just
I teIrclIer- trying to connect with hrs students.
During his regulIIr hours, he hardly ever sees his
students.

“I don't advertise in class,"Jones said, “or tell
my srrrdenrs when I'm bIrtending."

Not that the ich of serving his students
bothers him, but rlIIr it's just I separate pIrr of
his life. There isn't much overlap between the
rwo professions other thIn his fIivorite part is
exactly the some for both.

“I like inrcrIctrng erh people. EspeciIlly
for a InIrhemIrician, I am I very social person,"
Jones ind. “I think rhIr [teIching Ind bIrtend-
ing] are similar in the way that you are present-
Ing something In front of two very different
crowds of people. But thIr‘s one reIson I like
and, I would hope, excel at both jobs."

But Jones doesn't plan on doing either job
for the rest of his life. He’s looking It getting
an industry job with his degree in statistics, Ind
he has been doing some consulting work in ad-
dition to his bartending and teaching. But right
now, with the job market in the tank and the
opportunities Ilive and well here in Grinnell,
Jones is happy to be quenching thiists.

“When I get it, I ‘IeIl J'ob,’I don't thinkI
would bartend Inymore. Mbee after I retire I’ll
sun Iinn. Mbee ifLonnski's is still open."
