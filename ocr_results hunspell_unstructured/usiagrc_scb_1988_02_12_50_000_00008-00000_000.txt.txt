Barrence
Whitfield

and the

by Leii Larson

“0W! OW! 0w! 0w! Ow!" walls
the Barrence, and here come the
Savages bearing down like a herd
01 water butialo on Benzedrine.
And like any good drug-induced
primal onslaught, it don't stop until
il hits one BIG brick wall- and ynu
know where that leaves the dance
crowd, Barrence Whitﬁeld and the
Savages don't just play Ben» they
kick it, Ilounce it, roll it, and
trounce it until it's a drooling,
bloody mess I'Iat nut on the floor

Coming out oi Boston, the

Savages are something of an
anomaly- a straightrahead,
Screaming RVB band in the finest
StaX/Volt tradition of Little
Richard, Wilson Pickett,
Screamin‘ Jay Hawkins and
James Brown, in a town known for
the Cars, 'lil Tuesday 7 and
worse, While local ”progressive"
radio touted the latest on 4AD and
Creation, the Savages Went to Lon-
don to proselytize the masses. In
London BBC 1, DJ Andy Kershaw
picked up on the Savages and soon
folks like Robert Plant, Dave Eds
munds, Robyn Hitchcock, and thr

Savages

tle Richard himselr were emerging
{mm the clubs converts. NME
headlined, “Kick Me Again
Jesus," Melody Maker pleaded,
“Dear God, we are all his children
now.” With three records to their
name they're back stateside hops
ing that we're ﬁnally ready {or
them.

Barrence Whitﬁeld (né Barry
White) trained his pipes on gospel
music as a child and there is NO
ONE that can get up in lront oi a
crowd and scream like he can.
Whitfield is a one-man hurricane
crashing oii the amps. rolling on
the ﬂoor, diving into the crowd,
and generally abusing his body and
anything in its way in a hypersonic
trenzy, So look out — “I really
don’t know what happens." be ad
mits, almost ecstatically ”I just
loooove playin‘ live. I lose myselr
in it. I've had nights when my
throat was raw and been so dizzy I
had to slow down berore I blacked
out; but when I go onstage, i want
to give it all.“ And the guy's an
asthmatic.

Balancing Act Album

by Eric A. Johnson and Thomas A.
Beverly

The Balancing Act have just
released their tirst fullrlength
album, “Three Squares and 3
Roof,” the followup to the critical-
1y acclaimed debut EP, “New
Campﬁre Songs." The group is led
by guitarist Jeff Davis and bassist
Steve Wagner, who share the
songwriting duties, with guitarist
Willie Aron and percussionist
Robert Blackmon rounding out the
lineup. The band’s sound is
reminiscent of a cleanedop
Feelies record, with interesting
rhythms and acoustic guitar
predominating. Neither Davis nor
Wagner is a strong singer, and
they rely on rough harmonies to
complement their vocals. Their
songs lack strong melodic hooks,
and the lyrics are often purposely
obscure. Davis and Wagner tend to
avoid traditional rock themes —
i e. love, politics, etc. 7 in iavor or
whatever seems to be on their
mind when they write the songs.
The result is an album lull oi pleas
sant ditties on bizarre subjects,
mindrhending but ultimately
llstenable.

ERIC: “Three Squares and a
Root" is like going up into your

batty uncle’s attic and opening a
dusty, old chest, There's all sorts
oi things that make you wonder,
but it’s all kinda neat. I really liked
the percussion on this album; it
kept the songs lresh and made up
Ior the lack of a hummable
melody, My tavorite song was
“Kicking Clouds Across the Sky,"
in which there is a “cry {or help
without subtitles/Outside it’s rains
ing Iallen idols." Like I said. I
don't know What it means, but it's
kinda neat, I'll give it a 3+.

TOM: This is another one or those
albums that really need to be
listened to more than once to begin
to appreciate them. These guys are
certainly not spectacular musical-
ly, but they are never uninterest ~
ing lyrically I think the best thing
here is “Searching For This
Thing," on which their lyrics and
music actually mesh, tor once, in
an intriguing song about laith and
luliillment This album is worth it
[or the lyrics alone (lyric sheet is
includedt. and perhaps Wagner
said it best, in “The Ballad or Art
Snyder”. “You might begin to
wonder/now these incidents
relate/They don‘t you don't I
don't/They just accumulate " Also
a 5+.
