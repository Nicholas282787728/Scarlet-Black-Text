A Thanksgiving collage from over-
heard bits and pieces:

The main bill of fare for last
Thursday’s feasts ranged from turkey,
hamandhamballstoduckandchicken,
and the Des Moines Register in a pre-
Thanksgiving food feature even sug-
gested fish because that is what the
invading Europeans at the time ofthe
original Thanksgiving ate the most.
Lobster, oysters, and all the goodies
from the Massachusetts waters that
mostofusnow considerluxuries,were
every-day fare to them, What a life!

There undoubtedly are some more
creative menus out there that Around
has not heard about, but turkey and all
the trimmings probably graced more
dinner tables than anything else.

Thanksgivingdinnersalsotakeplace
all over the calendar now from Hal-
loween to Santa Lucia Day (Dec. 6 to
all you non-Svenskas).

That’s because Thanksgiving has
become a favorite time for family get-
togethers, usually without the threat of
bad weather (witness lowa’s picture
perfect 1998 Thanksgiving season) or
the stress of Chnsimas (it's easier to
get up forthoscs a.m. wake-upcallsto
see what Santa has left underthe tree in
the sanctity of one's own home than in
someone else’s.)

The airlines confirm this fact:
Thanksgivingistheirbusiestseason of
the year.

This is not even to mention the fact
that more family Christmas gift decir
sionsprobablyaremadeThanksgiving
weekend than any other, almost con-
dcnsing the two seasons into one.

lings, according to Brett Sampson, ass
sistant manager, and true to tales of
their availability in other locations, a
crowd was waiting outside the Grin-
uell Wal-Mart at 6 am. when the store
opened.

There was a little pushing and shov-
ing, Sampson says, but for the most
part people were quite well behaved.

The Furbys were on displayjust in-
side the main entrance to the store, not
in the back in the toy department, and
customers were allowed to purchase
them one at a time in order of their
place in line.

There probably will be additional
Furbys some time in the future,
Sampson says, but right now there are
notenough being produced to meetthe
demand, so it's hard to tell when they
will become available.

City may benefit from college’s
Fund for Excellence initiative

By JOHN BREEMER
News/opinlon editor

AportioiiofGnlincllCollege’sFund
for Excellence is likely to go toward
some off-campus effons that will die
rcctly beneﬁt the community, accord—
ing to a preliminary plan issued by
kusseilk.Osgoodthecollege'spresi-
dent.

ln :i memorandum dated Nov. 25,
Osgoodinforr‘nedcollegetrusteesfaCr
ulty members, staff, students and the
“City of Grinnell community“ that he
has settled tentatively on several inl-
tiatives that will beneﬁt from the $5.3
million fund established for the
college's new ﬁscal year.

However, no specific funding
amountsarecontainedinwhatOsgood
calledadraftofhispiansforailocating
the money. He is seeking more public
comment on the tentative plan before
issuinga“finalpositionpaper"onDec.
15.

The preliminary plan contains a sec-
tion entitled “Social Commitment," in
which Osgood outlines possible col-
lege expenditures involving the city as
a whole.

Community of Teachers

“We will continue our commitment
to the public school system and expend
money either for the Community of
Teachers Project or, ifthe school sys-
tem and our college-based committee
recommend it, to some other meritori-
ousprograminthe publicschools,"the
draft memorandum states.

The Community of Teachers Fro-
ject provides money thatallows mem»
bers ofthe Grinnell-Newburg School
District facultyto take sabbaticallcave
and spend time at the college for in-
depth study in their fields.

Osgood also says the College will
contribute funds to help develop a
master plan for Grinnell‘s downtown
area. But that will be contingent upon
”an indication ofcommitment by local
ofﬁcials and key membeis ofthe local
business community," he emphasizes.

GRMC learning facility

Another possible expenditure from
the Fund for Excellence will be “shar-
iiig certain costs with . . . Grinnell
Regional Medical Center for a dis-
tance teaming facility downtown that
would offer courses for those of our
staffwilling to pursue a higher educa-
tion option not available at the col-
lege,” the memorandum states. “Fi-

tioned in one or more projects in the

 

1998 sets a record
for nature’s toll

The Associated Press reported the othcr day that, so far this year, weather
disasters have cost the world $89 billion — the most ever and more than
disastrous conditions havc cost for the entire decade ofthe ’80s

Maybe that staggering sum, which actually quantifies the damage, will
move some doubters toward a conviction that something is wrong, and that
people should take a much harder look at how they might be contributing to
the climaiic changes that are causing all these meteorological disruptions,

The Worldwatch Instilutc and reinsurance giant Munich Re conducted the

assessment, focusing on ihings like
tornadoes, hilrncanes, floods, ﬁres
and drought. They found something
very disturbing: Although 1998 still
has a month to go, it already has had
losscs that are 48 percent higher
than 1996, which until now has been
distinguished as the most disaster-
dontinatcd year In terms ofthe
weather.

Sctli Dunli, an expert on climate
change for Worldwatcli, had this to

downtown area to help enhance thc
downtown and thereby the attrac»
tivcncss ofcoming here as a student or
faculty member."

The college's trustees established
the Fund for Excellence as an effort, in
Osgood’s words, “to enhance strategi-
callyihecunentmissionofthe college
by funding special prolects and oppor-
tunities, outside the current base bud»
get of ihe college, both to test their
efﬁcacy but also to encourage the colr
lege community to think hard about
what we are currently doing or what
we might do instead or additionally.“

Recommendations sought

Osgood sought comments and rec-
ommendations from members of the
campus community, as well as resi-
dents of Grinnell as a whole. He has
been studying those recommendations
since he became the college’s new
president.

Not surprisingly, the broader focus
ofthe draft proposal is on the campus
community, not the city.

Osgood notes that architectural and
planning consultants have begun a
study of the college’s needs and are
expectedto make recommendationsin
about 18 months. Those recommenda~
tions may mea’n some reconsideration
ofdecisions regarding how best to use
money placed in the fund, he states in
the memorandum.

However, Osgood's draft memo in»
dicates that he strongly favors the con-
cept of instituting a “capstone" project
that will be required of all Grinnell
College students. If implemented, the
requirementwouldmeantliateachsru»
dent attending Grinnell would become
involved in some sort of research or
creative project during his or her ycars
at Grinncll.

More work by faculty

Osgood acknowledges that such a
requirement would tax the faculty,
whose members would have to do more
oneronrone work with students.
“Some growth of faculty will prob-
ably be necessary, but we would also

consider a modest increasc In the .«7e
of tutorial classes, a reduction ofthe
overall size of the midrlevel citricur
lum, a reduction in other independent
projectsandareallsllccredltlngmechar
nism for the work represented by these
capstone projects,” he ivntes

Other potential benclicrarics of the
Fund for Excellence, according to
Osgood, include:

- The design and construction of
“the third and ﬁnal phase" of the
college'sNoyceScienceCentenwhich
would include new biology green-
houses,moreonrsitelaboratories anda
science library.

. Planning for a foreignrlanguagc
building that would house all language
departments and include “modern elec~
tronic facilities for language instruc-
tion."

-Fullfundingforwhattsbeingcailed
the college‘s Center for Prairie Slud~
ies. That proposal, Osgood states,
“would “provide a vehicle for us to
project ourselves in [oi-3a and the im-
mediate areas, and to larger constitur
encies, including high schools, other
colleges and universities, and public
and governmental entities. i hope that
it will allow us to build bridges to
corporations, museums and other in-
stitutions dealingwith our umque prai-
rie home.“

- Evolution ofthe college's Cliiiiese
program “into an East Asian Studies
program that will eventually include
Japanese language instruction."

‘Technologicalimprovements to be
deterrruned by the college's dean and
treasurer.

- The appointment of “additional
high-qualityfacultyofcolor."Osgood
states: “We have had a lot of rhetoric
here at Grinnell, some of it strident,
andnotenoughaction.Thetwomaybe
linked, We need hard work, coopera-
tion and a positive attitude and then, I
predict, we will make additional
progress,"

- A beefed»up effort to attract what
Osgood calls “traditionall y under-rep-
resented groups" to attend the college.
