Evaluate
faculty

The faculty is the collegeiin many ways.

Students are concerned about the performance of
professors. And rightly so.

Informal evaluation goes on each day as students criticize
faculty work.

Each department's EPC (Educational Planning Com-
mitteel is the formal channel through which students may
evaluate present and prospective faculty members. EPC
members voice their own opinions as well as gather those of
other students.

Altogether, 28 faculty evaluations have yet to be com-
pleted this year, according to Dean Walker. He explained
that this is not an unusual numberofevaluations.

Unusual or not, those evaluations provide considerable
room for students to state their opinions.

Students can comment on the performance of professors
now on campus.

But beyond that, they can consider how present faculty
members fit into their departments. Does the professor’s
talents and areas of interest add to a well-balanced program
in the discipline? Do they coincide with the kinds of offerings
that Grinnell should be providing? These opinions can and
should be voiced to EPC and department members.

Currently, a group of students is encouraging the theatre
department and EPC to consider hiring a professor with a
background in film. Nancy Carpenter is compiling a list of
students who have done some work with movies and have a
strong interest in further work in that area. She will be
presenting the list to the theatre EPC soon.

The department is looking for a person to teach drama
history and drama literature and to act as a director. Thus,
explained one EPC member. the film work and background
of prospective profs is “only one small facet of the choice.”
However. he explained that if it came down to a choice of two
or three equally qualified people, and one or more had
background in film, the petition might very well be taken
into account.

Those interested in film are in no way assured of the hiring
of someone who can guide them, but they have done what
they can to get such a person on campus.

At a small college like Grinnell, informal channels of
communication can be used very effectively to evaluate
professor performance and the composition of each depart-
ment. The formalized channel, the EPC, can only be effective
if students and faculty allow a give and take of opinions. It
becomes totally frustrating when it appears that department
members are disregarding student opinion.

However, students should not give up even when faced
with what seems to be a brick wall. Opinions should be
continually voiced as in the case of those interested in film. It
is in students’ best interest to evaluate professor per»
formance and suitability for Grinnell.

Trustee disagrees
with editorial

To the Editor: Recently I was very
disturbed after reading your
February 11, 1977 editorial, “How
much longer will we drift?” I was
disturbed because. from this
trustee’s perspective, it appears
that no matter what approach or
position Dick Turner takes he will
be Criticized. Basically I feel this is
unfairand is notinthe best interest
of the college.

In response to an articulated
need of the college and at the
strong urging of the trustees, Dick
Turner devoted a lot of time and
energy to preparing an interesting
and thought-provoking “White

New
Intercom

.
policy
To the Edilor: AS the editor of
the GCCF intercom I would like to
respond to that part of David
Donahue’s letter (5&3, Feb, II)
which concerns the intercom.
The policy of the intercom on
accepting contributions for
publication has lradillonally been
a vague one. Previous editors

. have, apparently, never felt the

need to clarify it.

In my second week as editor [his
vague policy was put to the test and
it failed miserably I received a
contribution from Mr, Donahue
which seemed to me somewhat
satirical. AS I was in doubt as to
whether this contribulion was
appropriate for the Intercom,
which is not a newspaper but a
newsletter, and had no clear policy
to guide me, I couldn’t in good
conscience publish the contribution
in the form in which i received it.
Much unfortunate confusion and
dissenslon “as created To avoid
such Confusion in the future, a
policy has been drafted by the
intercom staff and is available for
inspection and discussion.

In accordance with this policy I
iiwite any and all members of the
campus community to contribute
their ideas on Christian themes to
the intercom. Please sign your
contribution, and submit it to me
(box no. 7) before 4:30 Monday
afternoon for that week’s issue

I thank all of those who have
supported me during lhcsc trying
vleeks iind hope that you will all
continue to help and even correct
me where you feel it is necessary.

Paper.” For his efforts he was
criticized for being autocratic and
[or not allowing greater in
volvement, Recently in response to
this criticism, he decided to take a
less direct approach to allow
greater discussion and par-
ticipation of the larger college
community. Now he is being
criticized for not providing
leadership. It appears as though
Dr. Turner will be criticized for
whatever approach he might take
irrespective of the logic of his
positions or the manner in which he
presents them.

I would be the first to admit that
Grinnell College has problems,
problems i feel can easily be
resolved if the total community
works together to address them in
a positive and constructive
manner. It is very easy to
Criticizeiespecially those in
positions of authority. Sometimes
it is more difficult to offer support,
understanding and viable solutions
in times of crisis.

For the sake of all concerned and
the future of the institution, let's
give Dick Turner and his ad-
ministration a chance. James iL

Committee: ,‘

'To the Editor: The Residence Hall
Improvement Committee is ac
tiveiy pursuing proposals to make
both practical and cosmetic
physical improvements in the
campus dorms, However, progress
on committee recommendations
has been impeded by reckless
student actions resulting in
damage to campus buildings that
often require one and a half days of
BBlG’s work week to repair.

The upsurge of onrcampu's ,
damage this year has occurred’
mainly on the weekends Clearly
there seems to be a correlation
between damages and allrcampus
parties or large dorm parties K
where great quantities of liquor
are Consumed, But the damages
are not all alcohol-related, and
many students have little sense of
responsibility for the maintenance
of community-owned property. it
is understandable that B&G
workers find it hard to be receptive
to student requests for repairs
when nearly onerfourth of their
work week is often spent cleaning
up after irresponsible students.

The Committee is addressing
this letter to the entire student
body for a twofold purpose. First,
we hope to raise student awareness V
about the, finite time and labor
resources of the college. Cleanup
and the cost of repairs impedes
progress on dorm improvemens,
We urge any student witnessing ‘5
acts of vandalism to please ask the
students to Stop and contact their
Resident Adviser or the Student
Affairs office, Secondly, we ask
that members of Joint Board,
Campus Coordinating Committee
and initiative Fund seriously
consider reducing the amount of
dollars spent on liquor at large
campus parties iResidencc Hall

result of system

To the Editor: Dismissals of well-
loved and respected college em-
ployees have produced a climate of
outrage on the campus; frightened
by what we perceive to he the
construction of an impersonal and
unresponsive bureaucracy,
studean react with hostility and
suspicion to all administrative
actions. And though the ad
ministration has done little to
alleviate the tension, our conscious
aggravation of the problem does
little more. in particular, students
take an excessively personal ap-
proach, constructing monsters of
injustice and brutality from simple
businessmen; what do we expect.
under our economic system?

The primary imperativcs of
business, under capitalism, are
efficiency and profits. All are
victimized under such a system:
the competition fostered by
capitalism lorces employers, or at
least allows them, to be relatively
ruthless If the businessman does
not fire the inefficient Worker,
eventually he is fired; if the
business cannot maintain a leading
margin of profits, it is bought out.
Such businessmen do not feel they

act unjustly; they are quite aware,
of the imperatives, and while they ‘
may regret the necessity, it is at
bottom a matter of survival.

It is right for us to combat this
insensitivity, fighting for human
rights within the conditions of the
system. But such effort. uncoupled
With a commitment to alter the
economic system which is lun-
damentally responsible, is, in the
end, fruitless While the competent
doctor treats painful symptoms, he
must also treat the disease to Cure

inseparable: a life of fighting!
endless small injustices leads to
disillusionment and despair, much

Grinnell students should go

individual to gain understanding of

dismissals, then put action in the
service of theory to become a truly
effective force for justice in the
