THE WORLD'S LOSS

Again history repeats itself: a con»
quering‘ people, thinking- only of their own
petty aims, destroy in a moment the cul-
ture of a rich civilization that has been
built up over a period of centuries.

Yes, Hitler is doing it again. A decree
put into effect Sunday sent Nazi storni
troupers illto the famous Austrian National
library in Vienna with orders to destroy
works by “non-Aryan" authors, To date, a
list of the books to be destroyed has not
been issued, yet it is safe to say that of the
1,200,000 volumes in the library, some in,
valuable works will be destroyed without
consideration of their value, either histori-
cal or cultural.

So racial intolerance, carried to an ex-
treme in Germany, becomes the means of

JAPAN IN CHINA

According to James Marshall,
eastern correspondent for Collier’s maga-
zine, lvhite control in China ended with
recent Japanese attacks on British and
American vessels, which he described as
acts of deliberate warfare on the part of
Japan. Marshall recently returned to this
country after being seriously injured in the
Japanese bombing of the U, S. S. Pansy.

The end of the long- period during which
the Far East has been dominated, economi-
cally and politically, by the United States
and the countries of western Europe, would
mark a distinct turning point in world his-
tory. Has Japan, which only 15 years ago
was a backward country seeking to emulate
the soecalled ”western” countries, now arisen
to a point where she canvdestroy the rem,
llants of white prestige in the Orient, and
demonstrate to all Asia that America and
the British Empire are afraid to fight?

Time alone will determine the results of
the Japanese action, and the extent to

which Marshall is right ill his predictions»

Perhaps the Orient would be infinitely
better off if Japan were to gain more con—
t' l, and if the white man would abandon

his “burden."

DlFFlCULTIES COULD BE OVERCOME

As a result of the sleet storm several

weeks ago, the trees on the campus are inl

a deplorable condition. When \le consider
that we have on this campus a variety of
trees seldom surpassed it is unthinkablel
that they shall be allowed to rot. ,

True, certain steps have already, been
taken tollard removing dangerous hanging
limbs; thus relieving the trees of this addi-
tional dead weight. Yet, many of the trees
still present open wounds to the elements.

Certain difficulties present themselves,
however, when further action is considered.
Most important is the almost prohibitive
cost of real repair work, which leaves always
the possibility of cutting down the damaged
trees and planting new ones. This we do
not believe is desirable,

Since we have on this campus, in the
person 01' Di. Conard, a man qualified to.
direct repair of these trees, we would sug-
gest that it should not be impossible to
hold the cost of repairs down by the use
of student labor.

LETTER
TO THE EDITOR

To the editor of the Scarlet and
Black,

I understand there is a strong
movement on foot among the
sophomores for the publication of
an annual next year. This moves
merit should be encouraged. Grin—
nell. which has always ranked
high among the state's educations
cl institutions, deﬁnitely has not
held its 0 as regards an annual
publication.

A yesrbock represents the
school to outsiders as no other
publication can. The junior class
of next ycsr has, I believe, the
talent and energy to initiate suc:
cessfully this enterprise, Once
started, the yearbook could be
handled each year by the junior
class, rather than by individuals
as has been the practice.

individual opelation on limited

funds, has led to inferior annuals,
sporadic in appearance and of un»
certain quality The cash outlay
for a classssponsored publication
would be considerable. hm. the
result would certainly justify the
expense.
' We should take advantcgc of
the enthusiasm now being shown.
An annual should be published
again on the Grillllell campus,
and next year conditions appear
ideal tor the first appearance of
a successful year—book.
