Program provides hospitalization ior none
major medical reasons and replaces the
old method of housing students in the
Health Center.

Crady cited the high liability the college
faced when housing students without nurs
ing care and the high cost of maintaining
the old program as reasons for the switch.
The Share Program entails no direct cost
to students and is paid out of the Health
Center Fee.

There are two levels oi care provided
under the program. The iirst is ior

they seem highly plcased; they like the
Grinnell environment and seem to respond
favorably to our students," he said.

The Rosenfield program is continuing to
try to convince more people who have
“signiiicant reputations” to visit

Although the Rosenlield program has
had many activities planned tor the up-
coming year. Mr. Moyer stresses that
there is still room for student input. “I
want to encourage students in general who
have ideas of things they want to do to br»
ing them to me," he said. The program
would especially like to encourage sugges-
tions ior nontraditional projects, “things
that don't involve lectures and speakers,
per Se.”

Students should also be aware that the
Rosenfield program iacilitates interest in
public affairs issues by providing limited
iunding and summer internships. it sponr
sors a number of internships where stamis
given to the students, “so it's a pretty
substantial stipend and students should be
thinking about their internships ior next
summer, “Meyers said.

Students can also be involved in other
ways: by picking up candidates at the air-
port or taking them to lunch and getting
the chance to meet and talk with speakers
informally,

Mr. Moyer would like to see more
students involved at a “close range” with
the program, there being good support
irom the community in general and good
attendance last year. Students should also
take the opportunity to avail themselves
more of the various research funds and in-
ternships.

“It‘s a distinctive program; ldon't know
of any other school that has one quite like
it There are international relations pro»
grams but nothing of the sort that we have
in terms 0! the wide range of things which
it does" he stated.

The Rosenfield Program was establish-
ed at Grinnell in 1979. Supported by a 1
million dollar endowment, the program
honors Joseph Rosellfield ('25), who has
been a member of the Board of Trustees
since 1940 and one oi the college’s most
generous supporters,

Broe inSlsts that if Grinnell “lags behind”
other. similar institutions in the formal
adoption at a Women’s Studies program,
she maintains that it is just this indepen»
dent “healthy skepticism,” together with
what she has observed as an atmosphere
of rigorous “intellectual honesty” that
creates conditions under which intelligent,
sincere change can occur. Brae considers
Grinnell less prone to a type at tokenism
she cites as “decorating syllabl" with a
few recognizable texts, without regard to
real continuity. and without realizing the
transformation of an entire discipline that
can accompany the thoughtful incorpora-
tion oi a new methodology. Broe believes
that at Grinnell, we have created a unique
environment in which not only new
methodologies, but existing ones. can he
constantly examined and reevaluated,
realizing that “knowledge is not a series oi
absolute forms ”

Although Broe Stresses that the yet to be
organized advisory committee will play a
significant role in decentralizing the
authority of her position, it should be noted
that the formation of such a group has not
been mandated, and Ms. Broe will be
responsible, as Noun protessor, tor the for
mation and direction of such a Committee.

Broe Cites objectives toward which she
would like our program to move, some oi
which she would like to implement next
semester. They include. the possibility oi
holding a conference of national
signiiicance, and the publication oi new
scholarly research in the form of working
papers: hosting speakers with experience
in specific academic disciplines; organize
ing iaculty and student seminars, increas»
ing the number oi iaculty within the pro»
gram; and the possibility of an academic
concentration in Women's Studies.

Broe hersell has made several contribur
tions to the scholarship oi Women's
studies, a few of which are: a forthcoming
book entitled Silence and Power: A
Reevaluation of Djuna Barnes (Southern
Illinois Press), and another book she is
working on with Fran McCullough entitled
Cold Comfort: The Letters at Djuna
Barnes, Broe has been recognized for her
achievements by the National Endowment
for the Humanities, the Rockefeller Foun-
dation, and the Modern Language Associa»
tion, at whose annual meeting this year
she will present a paper entitled “My Art
Belongs to Daddy: The Women oi l-iaylord
Hall,"
