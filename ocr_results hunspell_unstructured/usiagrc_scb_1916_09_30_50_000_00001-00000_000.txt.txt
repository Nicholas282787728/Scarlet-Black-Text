set l-lolman, celebrated American Dis
anisl, has been scheduled as the sec~
and attraction 01' the Grillncll School
of Music recital course. He will an.
Pear in Gi‘illllell on October 20.

Although the complete program for
the School of Music course has not
yet been delinitely completed for the

The recital by Josef Holman on
October 20 is certainly one or the best
attractions in the musical line that
Griimell has been able to oilcr in
years. '

Hotman is regarded by many critics
as the world's greatest pianist. In
New York he has too many years been
looked upon as one of the most coloss
