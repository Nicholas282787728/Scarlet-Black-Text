Those who arrive as sonighss Gardner pariy
expecting heas—dsiyen pop rock. mosh piss, and
heverages will he disappoinred on all hus one
couns. For while she scheduled aess promise
so deliver an unconvensional, largely cxpcrl-
nicnsal audisory expericnce, shey do nos purv
pors so incisc largescnle hoory shaking.

Sponsored by SGA Concorss and KDIC,
she Gardnerconcerrwill include performances
hy Joan oFArc, Ed Gray, and Jamie Schweser.
According so Mass Ryan '00, she head omone
cerss commirsee, she unique ssyle of each
group will lend she show “a dilterenr reel shan
she Rainer Maria Show,"

Joan of Are, a Chicago hand known for
rheir unusual noise efteess, arrful lyrics, and
iinpredicsahle live performances, will headline.
To Ryan. she hands mix of “experimental,
melodic, ‘emo-y,‘ and minimalist," ssyles cone
srihure so a musical characser shas is “kind of
hrainy, but nor in a prescnrious way.”

Much orshc band's missicsprings rrorn she
inﬂuence of such elecsronica pioneers as
Krarswerk Guisar, drums, and bass serve as a
foundasion for an array of unconvenrional
noise effecss, or “weird sounds," as Ryan pus
is. ,

Also, she singers vocal ssyle adds so she off-
heas ﬂavor: Fhil Goudreau '00 jokingly com-
menred, “We encourage everyone so please ask
Mass why shey are like shas and what’s wrong
wish [she singer's] voice?”

The lyrics sake inspirerion from wriser
James Joyce and singer Morrisey.

Wasching she hand in acrion, said
Goudreau, is a “unique experience." Joan of
Arc makes his liss of "she sop five hess hands
in she world,"

The concerr's osher performers will add so
she off-heas flavor ofshe evening. Ed Gray, a
solo singer and songwriser from Iowa ciry, also
uses “ssrarigc noises" in his music, said Ryan.
"He is a rolls guy [whose music] is weirder shan
ssraighs folk." In a hroad sense, Ryan descrihes
Grays acousric sound as “plaintive and per-
sonal,"

Bath Gray and she evening's shird per-
former, Jarnie Schweser, share a connecrion
heyond rheir musual appearance in Gardner
lounge, Both arsisss rccenrlycompleredasour
