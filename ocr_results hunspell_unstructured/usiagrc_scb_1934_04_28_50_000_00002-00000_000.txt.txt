OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT

Action of the revived Student Council to date
has not been very impressive so far as prolnptness
is concerned Originally, Fridah Ap il 20, was
set as the date upon which the students WGV‘G to
vote on the new council constitution, Almost illi-
iilcdiatcly the action was postponed until the fol.
lowing Sunday.

Following the election, tile results of the bale
lot were promised For Tuesday cvcliillg. Then the
announcement was postponed until Friday, and
now ..... ‘3

The latest postponement has been explained
on the grounds that one of the council officials.
who was in charge of the women‘s votes, was si .
Why the ballots could not have been turned over
to someone else was not explained.

It must be granted that there is no necessity
for rushing through the election of next year’s of
floors, and that the actual count of the constitution
vote is unimportant Since overwhelming approval
of the document was assured. In this case the oil-
ly basis for objection to the council’s procrastina-
tion is “the principle 01' the thing,"

Having so recently been awarded such all iti-
crease in campus power, the council should recip-
rocate by being as efficient as possible in its ace
tion. It is simply a question of getting off on the
right foot.

THE GAME'S THE THING

During the past few weeks, competition in the
men’- intramural sports has become steadily lliol'c
streiluou and more bitterly contested. Ill many
ways, such a condition is highly desirable. It rc-
veals unusual equality among the teams and a very
activc interest iii the inter-dorlliilol-y progralil;
both of which point to the success of the scheme.

It is undeniably true that the athletic ability is
more evenly d'1tributcd through the halls this
year than it has been ill the past. As a result. 00m.
petition for the sweepstakes trophy and the awards
in the various sports has been much more close
than iii previous years, a circulitstalicc wlii li
Should create keen interest and encourage hard
play.

In solne recent contests, however, the close.
ucss of the competition has brought. about some
regrettable incidents. Some of the teams have lost
sight of the real purpose of the intramural pro-
gram. It was not instigated that the club room
niantcls mightbe lined with trophies, nor that one
hall might procure a sweepstakes trophy which
would signify superiority over all its rivals. The
whole program was devised that men of less than
varsity caliber might not be denied the p10 urcs
and benefits of active athletic competition,

While it is pleasant to win, the importailt
thing, esp lall ill llltOl'rthl‘tllliol’y sports, is truly
the game. It is this Fact of which some of the
teams have been losing sight, or, in some cases, not
the teams blit the spectators oil the sidclillcs. It
is quite easy to lot the sparkle of a silver trophy
blind one as to the real purpose of the game, but
the intramural program will furnish a lot more
fun, and be of considerably more worth, it the
participants clnphasim the ilnptll-tallcc of playing
rather than of winning.

A NEW CONCEPT

When evolution came into its owll, there was
a hue and cry that God was being disposed of, and,
in his place, lifeless science was being \VOI'r
shipped. Biology became unpopular because, for
the oldrf iolled, theological minded people, it do-
‘ 'oycd faith ill a personal God and the divine or —
gin of things.

Today, however, biology and the other . iclnu
cs have presclltcd a. concept of God, of man’s rel:
tion to tile universe, which is far noblcl, and po
sibly more satisfying, than the belief ill a personal
God, llcai'ell, angels and other similar ideas of
the traditional mind.

Pl‘csclltrdny psychology teaches us that man’s

llut what about life, the universe? If God does
not enter into the scene, then all is cold. dead,
meaningless!

This, however. is not tllc picture which lliolor
gy i-cvellls. Nature i. not cold and dead. but warm
and living. All nature is teeming with r i'ity,
whether it be the atom or the lllicl‘obe. Nature is
ever growing and changingY and (lying and being
reborn. it is plastic, fluid, dynamic, and ilot some-
thing which some absurd deity made out of notlh
ing sonic thousands of years ago. and called good.

lrilic lliliil. iiiiturc is alive, and is related to
him with bonds as strong as those l)(‘l\r\'(‘(‘ll mother
and child, or brother and brother, "ho, liiiis and
principles which gilidu our living, natural BllVll‘Ol‘lv
lllcnt, also guide us. And if we must bring ill God,
then God is nature, with whom we have warm and
direct relationship.

Biology has not found it new God, bilt has
merely revealed his presence to us through the il-
luilliuatioil oi" lllOLlL‘l‘ll Siccutific discovery.

“DEPRESSION BABIES”
(McGlll Daily)

In a few weeks some five hundred graduates are
stepping into what they hope is a receptive world, bealu
ing the degrees of this university, and equipped to make
their way in the various occupations which they are ens
terrng.

It is worthy of comment that they have passed
through a singularly interesting time or study, When
they entered the university in the fall of 1930. the world
was on the point of reaching the abysmal depths of de-
pression. Throughout their college career they have con»
tinued through the depths of depression, hampered a
little by its effects, no doubt at the same time learning
a great lesson.

Those who have made a special study of the rea-
sons and effects of present day conditions, have been
afforded a magnificent experiment. Those who have not
been directly connected with such studies, have never»
theless been able to observe what has been going on
around them.

This great object lesson, learned in a time which is‘

rrrost adaptable for the assimilation of such a lesson.
should not be forgotten The students of this time, the
“Depression Babies," have the knowledge at their dis-
posal to qualify their being true citizens of this and any
other country, With the qualification they have gained
behind them, they should look to the future with the cle<
termination that they can be the ones to protest their
common interests, with those of their country.

Human nature and zeal is always the same, but
these graduates have a wealth of instruction and expe-
rience to temper those all too prevalent railings which
can wreok our safety and progress. Let us, in wishing
them all the success and happiness that is their due,
remind them of their great obligations to their fellow
creatures, their country, and the world.

RETRENCHMENT IN EDUCATION
(The Minnesota Daily)

Retrenchment in education has been periodically
deplored since the first days of the depression. The cry
has always been that we must economize, but never in
the school system. for on it rests the responsibility for
the production of future leaders and citizens. What hap.
pened in 19337 Some 2,000 rural schools failed to 0 en,
some of those opening were forced to charge tui or'r.
Nearly 1,000 country schools ran for about three
months and 18,000 more are open for only six months
each year. In nearly all cities, the school year has been
reduced from one to two months. It has been esti-
mated that, sl the close of last year some 1,250,000
children were unable to attend a school of any kind.

This closing of the schools and shortening of the
school term is not the disease, but is rather a symptom.
The disease is a great reduction in educational appro-
priations. The amount of money spent last year for pubs
no education was somewhat less than half of the annual
expendrture during the period between 1927 and 1930.
Cuts in school budgets ranged from 20 to as per cent,
A typical example is Chicago, which cut its school bud-
get 35 per cent, at the same time that the general bud-
get was reduced only 10.3 per cent.

The outlook for this year is a black one. The pro-
posed school budget for the entire nation is about 65
per cent of that for last year, and only 27 per cent of the
annual expenditures during the 1927-30 period. This
means that education, particularly elementary, is fac-
ing a definite cr-is . At Columbus, Ohio, a citzens'
conference has been held to consider the matter. The
voices of the children will never he heard. The school
teachers, fearing for their jobs, can never complain. It
is a vital matter which calls for action by the entire
public.

RACE PREJUDICE
(The Oklahoma Dﬂlly)

The fact that real and just thinking is often impeded
by prejudice is clearly shown by a survey made in
New York recently among a representative group of
Amelicaus. From 1,000 Americans of average intelli—
gence, it was discovered that 98 per cent were prejudiced
against the Bolsheviks, 90 per cent against the Turks,
50 per cent against the Mexicans, and 30 per cent
against immigrants,

One's prejudices are basically the result of placing
too much stress on primary values and contacts rather
than an ultimate ones. it seems that these erratic
views arise from the Americans desire to look to him-
seli rather than outward. People are essentially inter-
ested in the group with whom they are in immediate
contactithc family, fraternal organizations, and their
own nation, And because of this attitude they cannot
see other people in the right perspective,

The goal of education is to develop real thinking.
There is no reason why these prejudices should exist in
the minds of intelligent men and women.

Thursday
L. P. Sherman, professor of cheme
istry, discussed the possible use of al
gasoline manufactured from regular
crude oil and alcohol made from corn.
This gasoline, Mr. Sherman bc—
lieves, would be as efficient and
practical as ordinary gas,
“There will no longer be a great
surplus in corn production if Con-
gress passes the law requiring a
certain amount of alcohol in g’asor
oline,” Mr, Sherman declared.

Friday
Elias Blum, professor of the theory
of music, played two selections on
the organ: Bach’s Chorale, “Jesu.
Joy of Man's Desiring”, and the
allcgrctto movement of Beethovens
Seventh Symphony.
