Postponed

Carnes’ Absence Causes
Change of Date

That a League board president-

, elect might have to be maid of

honor at a wedding during elec—
tions was not one of the contin-
gencies anticipated by the associa-
Lion's founders. So when the sit-
uation turned up this week, tradi—
tions had to fall.

Betty Games, elected president
of the Women’s Self-Governnrent
association last week, will be maid
of honor at the wedding of Miss
Mary Lou Heaton to James Mzm-
ville at the time when cottage
chairmen are usually announced.
The wedding will take place at 3
o‘clock Friday evening in Cedar
Rapids.

Ordinarily, nominations for cot-
tage chairmen would have taken
place tonight, elections tomorrow,
and the results would be an-
nounced at a formal dinner Friday
evening. But because of the un-
foreseen hitch in the plans, each
event will be postponed one night.
