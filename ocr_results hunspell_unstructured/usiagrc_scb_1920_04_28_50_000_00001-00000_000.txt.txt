The ﬁrst dual track and ﬁeld or the
season will be held with Cornell dt
Mt, Vernon next Saturday. According
to a statement made yesterday after
noon, CoachH. J: Huft expects to in»
vade the Purple camp with a sound of
about sixteen men.

With the names .0: Minty, Hoyt, Er
vans, Winter, and Vinsel in the short
races, the relays, and the hurdles, ap
pears that of Linn Smiui, who will
compete for the ﬁrst time in a dual
meet for the Scarlet and Black in the
dashes and relays. Reece and Kuo
will he entered in the half mile along
with Richards, who is a letter man in
this event.

Si esmitli in Broad .iump

Shoesmitb. who has been showing
up well in the broad jump, will be gi-
ven his ﬁrst trial Saturday, Vinsel be-
ing the regular on this job, as well as
in the high jump. Herr-iott who won
the discus throw in the Home Meet,
will be entered in that event as well
as the high jump. Daubenberger, who
has not as yet reached his last year’s
form, will throw both discus and shot,
while Hicks, who took ﬁrst in the shot
in the Home Meet should rate high in
that event.

This being The ﬁrst meet of its kind
this spring, should afford a good op»
portunity for lining up the new candi-
dates, as well as getting a, line on the
regulars.

Scnnty nope.

Little can be said of the relative
strength of the Pioneers and 0! Coin
nell since neither has done any track
work aside from that at the Drake Re~
lays last Saturday. Judging ”om
comparative records of last year, the
Scarlet and Black, having practically
their whole 1919 .squad back again
this year. should be able to turn the
trick. Old Doc Gloom hangs over the
heads of Winter and Hass in the shape
.of ineligibility, but if this cloud can
be lifted the Pioneel‘s’ chances will be
materially strengthened.

The meet with Missouri University,
scheduled for May 15, here, is the
ﬁrst held with that institution for a
number of years. As tar as can be
learned it is only the second one ever
held with the Southerners, the ﬁrst
being won by the Pioneers by two
points at Columbia in 1905.
