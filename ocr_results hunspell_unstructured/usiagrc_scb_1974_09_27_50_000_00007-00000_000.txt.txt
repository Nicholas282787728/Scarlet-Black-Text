Gay perspectives

How dare you

by Richard Clearer

Gay people are discriminated
,gainst. This is, of course. a
disgraceful situation, rind I, ai
least, am committed to endliig it.
Oppression is rlitierent iroin
discrimination. The latter Is a
practical. clayrbyrday series oi
events; the iormer is a pervasive
atmosphere a part oi every gay
person's experience it is not burnt
posters or derisiye turns oi phrase,
although such things have a
cumulative impact It is the tray
Weuple are taught to think oi
themselves. are led to react, are
trained to regard their Icllows, We
are all brought up to consider gay
people as pathetic moral and
emotional cripples, it not
dangerous, at least ii~ esponsible
(hence discrimination), We are not
encouraged to come to terms with
our sexuality nor, heaven iorbidl
to express it, but to escape it. You

tell us not to give up hope, we may
be curable, not to worry, we can
always pass. The discrimination
we see around us breeds fear. if we
meet other gay people, we in-
stinctively despise them as we
have learned to despise ourselves.
We avoid Irlendship with one
another. We are splintered within
and without by your oppression oi

us.
Q All these elements oi oppression
gay people can (and many 01 us
have) succeeded in neutralizing, in
some measure. A stronger element
is the constant assumption that all
the world ls straight. All the world
is notstraight, just as it is not white
or male or Englishrspeaking Your
persistent reiusal to acknowledge
our presence conspire: to give a
sense oi unreality to our lives that
undermines our pride, our ieeling
that we are people with something
to offer the world. When we deny
that we are what we are not,
namely heterosexual, we are
accused oi making an issue ot an
irrelevancy. My gayness is uot
