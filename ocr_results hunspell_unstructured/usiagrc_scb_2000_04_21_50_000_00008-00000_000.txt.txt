Lcrrcr ro rhe campus:

As presidenr of rhe Sronewall
Coalirion, (Srone Co), 1 would like
ro riaank everyone rhar arrended rhis
year’s Pride Week evenrs ror making
ir one of rhe most suceessful Pride
Weeks ever.

This year, we were able so bring
in some absolurely amazing speak.
ers, ineluding Rev, Dr. Mel Whire
and Dr Ann Pellegrini and I wanr
ro Lhank everyone rhar helped make
rials evenr possible. Nick Myers, Sara
Jensen, Phillip Hales, suzyShmagin.
Marr Kaler, Joseph Nelson and l have
been working diligenrly from rhe firsr
week of die school year ro organize
Pride Week 2000 and lr is because of
rhese people diar Pride Week was so
grear.

As a srudenr organizing rhis
evenr, I wanr ro express my extreme
disappoinrmenr in rhe GBLT com-
muniry as well as everyone our diere
diar considers rhemselves an ally.

Even rhough Pride Week was
oursranding, l‘am lefr feeling frus-
rrared and angry very few people
helped organize rhe week, leaving rhe
bulk ofrhe work ro die Pride Week
eommirree. Many ofyou were con-
renr ro arrend rhe evenrs and rhe
parry ar Harris, bur you avoided my
eyes when I asked you ro help wirh
somerhing murmuring some excuse
like roo much work ro do. ‘

lspenr rhe berrer parr ofriie week
before PW sranding ouoide rhe din-
ing hails eolleering ID numbers for
rhe pienic ro be held lasr sarurday. I
am amazed ar die number ofcxcuscs

lwas rold when I asked people ifdrey
would like so donare rheir 1D numv
bers. I was even more amazed when
i saw chose same people ar rhe pie.
nie earing food rhey didn’r donare lD
numbers for. The lack of consider.
arion and maruriryl experienced was
unbelievable.

Bur die rhing rhar really makes
me sad and angry is rhe lack ofar-
rendanee ar our lasr evenr of rhe
week, Nick Myers worked hard ro
ser up a meering wirh Prank Thor
mas who is involved in rhe campus
masrer plan.

At 9 pm. lasr Sunday. he was ro
meer wish me crinnell eommuniry
abour ‘what would happen so
GLBTA space in rhe coming years
as rlie Sronewall Resource cenrer
(SRC) and irs building will likely be
rorn down.

only four people were rhere, I
hear srudenrs ralking abour how rhe
adminisrrarion is uneommunicarive
and how rhey never ralk ro srudenrs
and rhey keep us in rhe dark, yer
when someonewho's reallyincharge,
like Frank Thomas, offers ro inform
us, where are you?

Did you know rhar dieres a pox»
sibiliry rharrheSRC(diaralso houses
GEAR and orher srudenr groupsl
mighr end up in dae proposed Cam»
pus Cenrerwuh mueh less spaee and
conﬁdenrialiry? No, you didn’r, be.
cause you didn’r borher ro show up.

Grinncll College is a haven ror
ail rypes of people. On campus we
have rhe freedom and rhe resources
ro be open and honesr and ro be
whoever we wanr ro be, Do you rhink

irs going ro be rhis way in die real
world? The SRC is an amazing ma
source rhar no orher college has ro
offer. And whar is your response
when ir mighr be raken away? Norh.
ing, because you don’t show up so
hear whar Lhc issues are or ro give
youropinions.Areyou allsolazydiar
youdon'tcarcaboutihefuiurcoflhis

l've been rold rhar rherearc mein.
bers of rhe Board of Trusroes who
don'i wanr ro make GBLTA space a
prioriry, because ir sends die message
ro prospeerive srudenrs and donarors
char cunnell is a “gay haven". These
are rhe people rliar are decidingyour
furure, nor yiisr regarding rhe SRC.
bur regarding rhe Campus as a whole.

lam so sick and rired ofrhe laek
ofcaring on rhis campus. Sure. you
care abour dicWTO proresrs and die
siruarion in Easr Timor. which are
borh imporranr, bur rliis campus is
BLIND ro whar is going on righr
here in crinnell on campus.

To rlic Editors:

Alrhough I am glad rhar Marr
Trager seems ro have revealed a
posirive opinion of Pope John
Paul II in his lasr column. rherc
are rwo rhings in his column
which I believe ro be opinions
based on eirher a lack of infor-
marion or a coinmirmenr ro
presenr ideology ro rhe campus as
informed opinion.

Mr. Trager's eolumn seems ro
be saying rhar rhe Pope’s penrrenr
behavior in rhe l-loly land lasr
monrh is a sign ofmodernizarion
wirhin rheChureh and ofrhe llb-
eralism oflohn Paul ll _ perhaps
Mr, Tragerdoesn'rmind rhis pope
because he sees him as a liberal.

lrhink rhar rhe campus come
muniry should know rhar rhe
Pope was aering as a rradirional
Carliolic in rlris regard as rhe
carholie religion is based on rhe
idea rlrar people are capable of
spirirual and eonseienrious
growrli Recognizing one’s sins
and asking for rhe forgiveness of
rhena is whar being a carliolic is
abour. lr is whar being a Carbon
he has been abour for over a rhou—
sand years.

The Pope’s noble acrions over
rhe lasr rwo decades, have been
based nor on modern liberalism.
bur on an aneienr, eonservarive
moraliry lohn Paul ii is a man
who firmly believes rhar each
human possesses an immorral
soul and rhar all are made in rhe
image of God.

ror rhis reason he has foughr
eommunisr governmenrs which
deny people rhe righr ro a spine
rual life and capiralisr govern.
menrs which ofren ignore rhe
needs of rho poor, ir is also for
rhis reason rhar he has vigorously
spoken our againsr possible hu.
man cloning in reeehr years (per
haps a slsi eenrury columnisr
will see rliis as anorlier example
of a Carholie who has “sup

pressed scienrifie discoveries").
lieel rhar Mr. Tragcr’s opinion
rhar rhe Pope is a liberal is mis-
informed.

The orher rhing i obieer ro in
his column is somerhing which is
nor rhe produer of misinforma-
rion bur insread rhe resulr offor.
warding unsubsranriared charges.
He wrires rhar rhe Church “stood
idly by while millions ofJews
were killed in rhe Holocausr."

This is an unrrue sraremenr
which I believe was infiueneed
by reeenr nrremprs ro rurn rhe
Church inro a scapegoar and
demonize Pope Pius XII Any-
one who looks over rhe fronr
pages of any newspaper pub.
lished during rhe war years can
see for rhemselves rhar rhe Pope
was eonrinuously denouncing
Nazism and rrying ro convinec
world leaders ro recognize rhe
evils of Nazism, The Vatican
also smuggled rhousands of
rhose who were persecured by
rhe Nazis our ofEuropc.

People who blame earlroli.
cism or rhe Pope for rhe Holes
eausr should remember rhar borh
Nazismand communism are ides
ologies rhar are based on com—
pleresubmission ro rhe scare and
abolishmenr ofrhe religious life
7 blame Hirler ror rhe conctnr
rrarion camps and Sralin for rhe
gulags.

lsrrongly feel rhar people, es.
pecially warmhearred and noble
persons such as Pius. should nor
be arraeked alrer rhey are dead,
especially by rhose who are less
inreresred in facrs rhan rhey are
in spawning global revolurions.

Though Mr. Trager is enrirled
ro his opinion. i feel rhar rhe
sraremenr abour rhe Holocausr is
based enrirely on misrepresenring
an organizarion so as ro forward
ideological eauses.

Sincerely,

lini Dinnerville ‘0!
