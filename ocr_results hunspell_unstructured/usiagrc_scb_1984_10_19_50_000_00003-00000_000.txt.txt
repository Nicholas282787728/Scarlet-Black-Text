Being There

by Jackie Lorie

The lirst image that comes to mind when the name Peter Sellers is
mentioned is that of a bumbling detective in the Pink Panther movies.
in the movie Being There. Sellers portrays a completely different
character. that of Chance the gardener. The movie is based on the novel
by Jerzy Kosinski. ol the same title. «

Chance is a simpleminded man who only has two pursuits in life:
watching television and minding his garden. One day, Chance is involv-
ed in a limousine accident and meets a wealthy socialite played by
Shirley Maclain. Maclain then introduces him to her husband and then
the President of the United States. Because Chance (now Chauncey
Gardiner) can only talk about his garden, people assume he is talking in
metaphors and attribute vast amounts of knowledge to his simple
statements.

By just being in me right place at the right time, a slow-witted man is
catapulted into the public eye and is allowed to make decisions that in-
iluence a whole nation. in this movie Sellers departs irom the comic and
makes a startling statement about svelety. Being There is playing at
AR" Friday, October 19 at 9:30 and Sunday the let at 9:30.

The Odd Couple

by M. Lewis

The odd Couple (yes, it's the origin of the TV. series} is a Nell Simon
comedy starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. It’s an example of
Simon at his best, beiore he became trite and overly commercial. The
Odd Couple is a straightlorward comedy, with no strange plot twists or
hidden meanings. It depends upon character lor humor, and the
characters are very lunny.

The main characters are Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, two divore»
ed men who are sharing an apartment, They are opposites in many
ways, and their personalities oiten clash. The movie has no real plot; it
is a situation comedy,

Both Matthau and Lemmon are excellent in this movie, and both are
perfect in their roles Matthau is the archetypical slob, and Lemmon is
so uptight and repressed that he would be an irresistable lcmptation to a
psychoanalyst

The Otld Couple is amusing and escapist without being mindless. It is
neither disturbing nor thought-provoking it is a simple, enjoyable com-
edy,

, The Odd Couple will be shown Wednesday. Oct 25 at 9:30 in AK“ (durr
lnlt vacation). . , _,. . ,- ,

by Cecil neincr

For those untartunatos who either stay here over break or decide to
return from break. the film society or Grinnell College gives us a real
Halloween treat: Allen. This movie. which started the rebirth of horror
films in the late seventies, is undoubtedly one of the most brutally
frightening films or our times.

Let‘s get right down to it. I've seen every class horror flick from All-
bﬂl and Costrello Meet Frnnkenstein and The Abominable Dr, Phibes to
It Came From Outer Space: only this movie, Alien, has made me jump

As in a later copy oi this iilm. Halloween, the monster can't die; yet
we humans give it a darn good chase. Needless to say. (but. I'll say it
anyway) almost every one dies a horrible death.

Forty-Eight Hours

by Jackie Lorie

it you put a tough cop (played by Nick Nolte) and a cockey convict
tplayed by Eddie Murphy) together to track down a killer, you get an
action comedy entitled 43 Hours. Nolte gets Murphy out of jail on a
[orty»eight hours pass to help him find this killer. Of course, the two hate
each other on sight, but alter the required ﬁst fight, they become
friends.

Since the movie only spans two days, the action is very fast-paced.
Murphy really shows his comic ability in this movie. A law memorable
scenes are when Murphy impersonates a cop, and when he’s trying to
pick someone up at a bar Nolte is a good straight man to Murphy’s
jokes and even manages to contribute a few good lines of his own,

The show does drag a little in places and some of the scenes are not
very original. Also, this show does not even attempt to leave a lasting
impression. But it you just want to watch a movie for iun, and have a
few laughs. this is a good show to see. 43 Hours will be showing in ARH
on Friday, October 2t". at 9:30 and Sunday, October 2d at 9:00.

The Trouble with Harry

by Kate Worster

The Trouble With Harry (Paramount, 1955) is the eighﬂi in Grinnell’s
series of Hitchcock films. The movie is a British style Comedy dealing
with death.

The iilm stars Edmund Gwen, Mildred Natwlek, and upcoming stars
John Forsythe and Shirley Maclain. The story revolves around a dead
body which mysteriously appears on a hillside of a small New England
Town. The members oi the community continually dig up and reshury
the corpse lor various reasons

Hitchcock said The Trouble With Harry was one of his favorite films.
Though not well received in the United States, the ﬁlm was extremely
popular in Great Britain. American audiences generally did not undersr
tand the humor of the morbid subject. The ﬁlm's reputation has lmprovs
ed over tlme, as have other Hitchcock movres.

The Trouble With llarry does have a strange term of comedy, but the
most distracting feature or the mowe is the beautiful autumn scenery of
Vermont, filmed in technicolor. Overall, The Trouble With Harry is a
good tilm with somewhat limited appeal.

The Trouble with Harry will be shown on Wednesdayoctober at at
3:30 and on Thursday, November 1 at (mo in the S uth L
