If there is one thing ill Gllunell thltt
may he called intolerable, that one
thing( is the telephone system at the
men’s dormitories,

If John Wishes to phone Mi’u'y tor a

distance he must \l‘ltlt patiently until
itll the other 15)?) men who were on the

Cured “her” permission to call at the
quadrangle at such and such a time,
or lneet "her" in Cooper school yard
at some other appointed hour, AS far
its calling the dorms from down town
is Coucerllcd, it simply “can’t he done.”

\V'e have often wondered what those
little hittel: rectangles \\'ere,—those—‘
all, you know—up by the ceiling with
the little black button In the center.
Somebody interlns us that they are
buzzers. But what are buzzer Y “'e

No amount of talking seems to bring
us a better phone system. W'e have
talked for more than a. year now, so
we have deeided to try writing.

If We are not going to use the buz-
zei's, let's institute a system of lines
Sengers. But if We are ever going to
have better phone service, LET'S
HAVE IT NO‘V.

MUSIC DINNER.

When we eat at the city cafe, our
forks Jieep time to the music at the
orchestra. At the Foweshiek, we hear
the Edison, at Candyland, the Victrola,
At the dormitory dining room, we hear
only the musical trickle of the soup.
At the quad dining hall,—perhaps
there is not even soup there to furnish
music. , -

The plan of music at dinner on Fri-
day, Saturday, and Sunday has been
suggested by several men at the
domis. A number of men have even
gone so far as to offer their services
for the purpose, but the plan has
lacked organization, and at present,
has not been worked out in detail.

Let us repeat the plan as we have
heard it, Think'about it, and then
ACT. Here it is: Let each building
in turn be responsible tor music at
one of the three meals just mentioned.
The men who play or sing need not
necessarily conic train that building,
but must be provided by that particu-
lar building.

Undoubtedly the women at the quad
rangle could work out a similar plan
for their dining room. Perhaps at one
meal every Week. an exchange could be
eilcctcd, the men going to the quad
tangle and the women to the dormi-
tnl‘ies,

If “music hath charms," let's have
music. . ‘

CHAPEL AND Clicll’EL-GOERS.

Thcrc are two kinds of clizlpel sel‘V»
ms in Grinnell nccrly evel'anol‘nillg.
And there are two kinds or people who
go to the service in Herrick Chapel
nearly evcry morning. .

One morning this week we had it
little experience with one or these
kinds of chopcl‘gocrs. Wc llzlvc exV
perienccd the same thing liclorc and
so have you. We happened to sit in
lront at two students who evidently
thought themselves good convcrsc-
Liunztlists but they were not. The Int
of conversation involves good listening
as well as good talking and to the
listening wits soiiicdiing these students
did not do. They talked in a in ping
whisper hour the time the spcakei
bcgzih until the sci-vice was over,
hardly keeping silent .duriog the
prayer. lliuybe they are talking yet
[or all we know. No, they were upper
class inanithn we do not say the
remininc side of the house never whis-
pcrs during chapcl.

The mzin, or woman, who goes to
chapel and whispers all tliru the ser-
\ice because the speaker does not talk
on a subject of particular interest to
him would bctter stay away. In the
first place such :i one is discourteous
to the speaker and secondly vel'y_dis-
tubing to others.

Grinncll chapel service is‘ not the
place to whisper the latest news to
your pal or skim thru the lesson for
that nincvtwenty class. It is rotlicr
the place to get a lresh supply or Cn-
ergy and inspiration for the day’s
we a short ﬁfteen minutes in which
we may lay aside our everyday tasks
and, thrp the talk, the prayer and the
organ benediction get a little broader
outlook on lite, a little closer sym-
pathy tor our lcllows and a little
deeper reverence for God.

True, some chapel talks seem not to
be worth ﬁfteen minutes at our time,
but most of them are worth much
more than_that, Chapel is worth while
and does hold. in the lives of some at
us 3. place of meaning. Let's keep on
going to chapel, but in the right spirit.
