—perfume pencils. It’s a real
honest to- goodness guaran-
teed automntie pencil, that
works just like any other.
And then in the top of it is,
not an eraser but a tiny vial
oi perfume! The pencil will
give your bag a dainty scent.
and you have only to turn the
screw top to release a drop
for your coat or hanky. a
pencil like this would be a
smart gift, too.
