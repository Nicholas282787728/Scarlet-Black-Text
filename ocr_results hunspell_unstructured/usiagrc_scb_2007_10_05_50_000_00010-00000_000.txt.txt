Mr. Trustee, tear down that wall

If you can name one trustee, con»
sider yourself lucky, If you've met one
trustee, consider yourself luckier. And
if you can actually contact a trustee to
voice your concerns, you are among
the luckiest on
Campus.

Thc Board
of Trustees. has
for a long time
held a reputa-
tion of being
secretive and
out of touch.
This ilisular
community, the ultimate dCClSIOl‘l’n‘lﬂk’
cts rot Grinncli college, fundamentally
shapes strident lifc.VVlthout broad stu-
dent input, trustees taisc tuition, change
admissions policies for international
students and alter the campus plan.

But characterizing the board as a
midwestern Skull and Bones is unfair
to its members. While trustees have
fthucntly railed to engage students in
their decisionrmaking processes and to
adequately explain the reasoning bee

hind their decisions, the fault does not
principally lie with the beard. Rather,
the administration strictly controls
trustees’ contact information and thus
access to trustees.

The game—
twccii stirdents
and trustees un-
dctmines both

_ communities.
Students have
no way to voice
their concerns to
the most impor-
lant decision-

inakmg organ at Grinnell. And without

a connection to students, trustees make

decisions without n full understanding
orthc consequences ottheir policy de-
cisions.

For the average student, SGAr
hosted open forums are the only way to
engage a few trustees in open dialogue.
This venue nearly disappeared last
spring, only taking place due to a last-
rninute effort on the part ofFTP.

But even if they continue to occur,

the forums are not enough. Students
cannot provide longsterm feedback to
trustees, and trustees cannot accurately
gauge student needs. What both mm,
munitres need is an avenue for continu—
ous interaction.

The solution might appear simple:
release trustee contact information to
thc student body But since the admins
istrarion is unlikely to support such a
dramatic change in policy, we hope that
sharing contact information for com—
mittee chairs could be a first step Pro-
viding trustees with ofﬁcial “@grrnncll.
edu" csinail addresses an altcrnativc
mechanism for communication.

On a campus that is changing as
rapidly as Grinnell is, good decision
making requires open channels or
communication. Either trustees or ad-
ministrators should take initiative and
establish a mechanism that allows more
students to reach more trustees. Don’t
restrict communication to the lucky
few. After all, you can’t reach mutually
beneﬁcial policies without hearing both
sides of the story.

l was ready to stir up a revolution, to provoke a
firestorm of criticism. When I started to write this
column, I planned to write an expose ofmy longsheld
belief that the Student Government Association is a
clique: insular, isolated, cut otrrrom the rest orcam-
pus. But 1 didn't want to jump to conclusions. so I
interviewed four senators
(old and new), talked to
President Megan Goet—
ing ’08 and chatted with
a slcw of others not me
volved with SGA. This
may have been bad for
the revolution: my per-
spcctive changed a bit.

At first, complaining with people u - tun, Many

SGA (including the cabinet arid the minors) is lll’
deed a clique lrwas a great ronvcr tion sr.utei,but
thc chatter soon died when I askcd \vhy students felt
cxcludcd. No one could olfci an explanation \vh),
with the c. option of a few personal gripes about
room selection and cabinet nominations, Unsurpirsr
ingly, none ofthese people who agreed with me were
involved with SGA,

No one I talked to has felt unwanted in the SGA

With more than tworthirds oFJoint Board having no
previous SGA experience, newcomers are welcomed
with open arms. I asked Gocring what members of
the student body could do to get involved, and she
extended a permanent open invitation to SGA ofﬁces
and meetings.

paper—for strident clirb use only, of course—the of-
fices are often lonely.

So why does SGA provoke such a hostile reaction?
I believe that SGA’s structure isolates the general stur
dent body. Joint Board, for instance, is the longest
meeting on campus—it has clocked in at four hours.
For order and efﬁciency,
Joint Board is run based on
par lamentary procedure.
But such a stringent sysr
tem makes an important
allrcampus meeting dif-
ficult for novices and our
riders to permeate.

In addition, uninvolved
students hdve a hard time undc tanding SGA’: inner
woi iugs due to the formality (and often inrccc
l)l r ,) of the minutes and curlstitutrturTlie emphasis
on unwritten precedent for budgetary mutt-is only
lilaltcs matters lvolse.

Beyond rhi senators have
vatving opinion. about the role
of constituent opinion. Some
feel they lcprc, ~nt the erntS and
needs of their constituents, A few
others feel they were elected to
be a delegate voicing their own
thoughts and demands at Joint
Board. The latter attitude breeds
elitism and creates another gap between senators with
such mindsets and the feedback oflhcir clusters,

What can SGA do to bridge these gaps; Three
things come to mind. Making minu s aiallrlblc.
comprehensible. and thorough would be a good start.

of discussions and groups dent cut it. For example,
budgets are left unexplained \vhilc thousands of dole
lats are allocated. I want footnotes, Minutes should
be available in commonly used areas. At the moment,
they are placed in a few bathrooms, depending on the
goodwill of senators, Help Desk and SGA cabinet.
The Grille, the dining hall, and dorm lounges should
also have copies.

Second, advertising for hall councils and fireside
chats should emphasize the major issues that will be
discussed.Tell students why it is critical that they at—
tend, rather than hope tree pizza will be enough in-
centive for constituents to Show up

Finally, Joint Board should remember that

ing times.

So. do I still believe that SGA
is a clique? No. SGA may be a
small group of people with a lot of
power, but they are not deliberately exclusive. Hon/cw
cr, merely having an open-door policy is not enough
to include those who do not know the content or pro-
cedure of what within the door, I challenge SGA
to make a new error - take your efforts to get constittr
ent feedback to the streets, In the meantime, olfer us
another explanation nfwho you are and what you do.
