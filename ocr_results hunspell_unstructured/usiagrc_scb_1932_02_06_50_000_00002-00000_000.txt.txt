CAMPUS CASTES
(From the Michigan stiite News)

If colleges and universities are supposed to he the
cradles cf the country's future leaders, and if customs
in the higher institutions of learning are precursors of
national habits, then America. is headed toward outer
cracy.

in the colleges of today it is the same as the feudal
systems of old~a welirregulatcd caste system with as
careful and exacting divisions as the most rigid’ of
ancient ones.

We have royaltyithe amletes. They are unlLDllchr
able in their aloofness from the common herd. They
the accepted, envied, and above criticism. The king
can do no wrong and we have our first division of our
modern feudalism.

We have nobilityﬁ the activity men. They are not
of royal blood but they are the controlling element. They
run campus activities and are as the lords of old, the
rllllng‘ class.

We have the fashionable gentryithc well-dressed,
wealthy student who has but to loll and bask in the
reflected light of his father’s gold. His is the port of
the court retainer, a “yes" man in a sense, biit still
secure enough in his wealth to be haughty and arro-
gant, but yet subservient to his lord and master. the
activity roan.

After this upper stratum of campus society is
named, we have but to add the long list. of students,
grinds, men and women working their way through, aru-
those who do little or nothing. It is sad, but true, in our
present college feudalism, that this last class named is
easily likened to the serfs in medieval times, a neces
sary part of society and yet unheralded, their work uu~
sung, and their individual existence as unimportant to
the whole system as the life of an ancient vassal.

PROFESSORS AND PUBLICITY
(From the Akron Bucktn'lioe)

There seems to be a periodical practice of college
professors rating the front page of newspapers through-
out the country. Some time ago, a professor of an East-
ern college stated than. all people who whistle are morons,

Walter Winchell challenged his radio audience to tell
him offhand the name of this professor. We, too, must
admit that we have forgotten his name, although it was
placed in a prominent posi on in practically every news.
paper in the country for a few weeks.

Now there comes to the front the college professor
who says. whether he believes it or not, that students
leam to think without thinking. Perhaps it was a slip
of the tongue, given in a thoughtless mood from the
academic platform, but nevertheless, college instructors
have the newspaper boys on edge to catch anything that
will amuse the general public, although it may be to the
dismay of the illustrious instructor.

Names are secondary and need not to he mentioned.
They will soon be forgotten. Professors who make idiotic
remarks for plibli sing themselves are even more amus-
ing than the comical statements.

The student publication at Northwestern university
is conducting a contest in which the students rate all the
professors on the campus, giving them an A rating, B
rating, or whatever thc student thinks the instructor de-
serves. This eontest without doubt will prove very inter—
esting. In fact, such a contest in any college would
prove interesting,
