QED itutiul

T the Debating Union meet-
ing Monday evening it was

dectded not to send the members
of thc intercollegiate team to Chi-
cago tor training in delivery. on
' account of expense and because
the training would probably not
trin the debate. Work along the
lines or just such a policy has
made Gilnnell lose all her
intercollegiate debates and null
continue to give the same results.
The question is not whether a
week's tlaining in dcllvely will
win or lose a debate, but it is
whether every lcqltitnate effort
has been put forth to make out
team successtul, Bydoing every
thing possible this year. and
leaving no stone unturned. there

in

will be encouraged it better <[7iril
in debating tn the future And it
is genctally admitted that do
lively has been Grinnclt's greatest
wt‘zikness in the intercollegiate
debates, yet here instend oi doing
all in our potter to remove this
weakness. we refuse to do any
thing. because it will cost some-
thing in money and effort. and
since we can't do it all in a short
time we decline to do anything.

OR the ﬁrst time in three
years Grinncll is to be re
presented in the state oratollcal
contest and every slttrlcnt who
can go should be in Oskaloosa
Friday evening to support our
college orator. A large delega-
tion will serve to show other

schools the interest that Grinnell
takes in oratory and this should
he done for the stale contest will
be in Grinnell next year and
nothing should be left undone
that will make both contests suc-
cesstul.
