WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5 1930

 

At The Theaters

By F. R. F

“Anna, Christie" with Greta
Garbo, George Dlnrion, Dlnrie
Dressler; m1 DI. G. III. production.
Appearing at the Colonial Sutur-
dny, Sunday, Monday, and Tues-
day.

If you have missed reading the
play, it's the story of a. fallen Swed-
ish girl who is regenerated by the
beauty of the sea.

It is the most natural thing in the
world when Miss Garbo begins her
lines 7

“Gimme a Whiskey—ginger ale on
th' side . . i . an’ don't be stingy,
baby!"

i-ler much discussed Swedish accent
appears only a few times but isn't
the least objectionable,

And we heave a sigh of relief now
that Miss Gdrbo's debut has been
completed and accepted.

This much-discussed picture is dil-
lei-exit. You ought to like it.

“\Vedding Rings" “'itll Lois \Vil<
son, H. 3. Warner, ouve Borden; a.
First Nationnl-Vitaphone produc—
tion. Appearing at the Strand to-
night, Thursday, and Friday.

Mr. Warner plays the difficult
role of a man who eats his cake and
still» has a. full ice-box; and he does
It skillfully. The novel, “The Dark
5min" by Ernest Pascal. from which
“Wedding Rings" was adapted, was
a sophisticated story of modern love.
The picture is careful to follow this
theme very closely.

“Is Everybody Happy 2” with the
Lewis, Ann rennington, Alice boy:
a Warner Bros. production. Ap-
pearing at the Strand Saturday,

i Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
with a father who detested jazz
and a boy whose thoughts were only
of music, things become a bit compli-
cated. We can sense some distant
relation to this Story to Dr. Steiner
in that red Lewis plays the part of
an immigrant if it weren't that Dr.
Steiner didn’t appreciate jazz.

Lewis appears with his band and

Miss Pennington and put on an

 

enjoyable show.

The threcvdimellsian picture
“Happy Days" has been showing
at the Roxy recently. The [7|le
lic likes the idea and production
is rushed so that Iilrgersize

ihcatres in the larger cities.

The Missouri—Valley conference
team above was picked by Coach J.
c. Truesdale of the Grinnell cagel‘s
as representative of men in the loop
whom he believes best in their
spective positions,

About the forward choices there
can be but little doubt. Van Ack-
eran. after leading throughout most of
the season, closed the season in sec~
0nd place in Missouri Valley scoring
with a total of 81 points. King of
Drake was fourth in the conference
with 65 points. Both men were
guarded in most of their games but
showed ability by coming through in
a pinch with long shots dead to the
hoop.

re-

THE PEST—

some midwestern critics ranked
Jensen of Creighton at center post
and dumped Ed Meyer, the Washv
ington pivot man, at a forward posi-
tion. Coach Truesdale leaves the
Bear captain at his post in the cen-
ter of the floor for he is undoubtedly
it much better basketball man than
Jensen. The chief point in favor of
the Blncjey star is his size and
Meyer is tall enough to control his
share of the tips in most games,

Corcoran and Douglas would make
a. pair of nifty guards for any man's
team. Both were in the first dozen
scorers of the conference and in ad—
dition showed uncrring instinct at
preventing other teams from getting
baskets. The stellar work of Doug»
las has been a big factor in keeping
opponents scores at a minimum for
Grinnell this season.
