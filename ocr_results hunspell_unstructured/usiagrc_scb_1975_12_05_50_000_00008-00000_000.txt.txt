Neﬂers no

Coach Ron Mitchell said Bill
Knox’s knees were knocking. teeth
were chattering and lips were
trembling. Kilox said he was
“kinda shaky." But nervous or not,
Knox sank two free throws with
three seconds left in the game to
give the Grinncll basketball
Pioneers a 63766 victory over Lake
Forest there last Saturday,

The win evened the team's
conference record at 1-1. The loss
came in Beloit the night before.
where the Biics smashed Grinnell,
31754. In a non-conference game
last Tuesday, William Penn edged
the Pioneers, 79-72, despite
Grinnellian John Haigh’s‘ wliopr
ping 35-point performance. The
loss spoiled the Scarlet and Black’s
first home game of the season.
Tonight, Grinnell plays at Ripon
and then challenges Lawrence
tomorrow at Appleton. Both are
conference matches.

Knox, a freshman, said he was
“thinking aboutother things" as he
stood at the foul line, “I figured if I
madejust one I'd be all right. But it
was the other guys who won the
game.”

Leading the other guys was alle
conference forward Haigh, who
poured in a gamerhigh total of 27
points, including 11 field goals in 14
attempts. Mitchell said he does not
think Haigh must score that manv
points each game to assure a win.

But the final seconds belonged to
Knox. With the score tied, the
Pioneers tried to work the ball to
l-laigh for the shot. The opponents
doublerteamed Haigh, which left
Knox open. The freshman took a
pass from Carl Warner and went
for two points. He was touted. Knox
hit on both free throws, despite
having to wait during a Lake
Forest time out after the first one-
pointer,

Despite Haigh’s performance,
there was evidence of a balanced
scoring attack. Starting guards
Carl and Roger Warner, and first-
string forward Jeff Fallon scored
in double tigures. Grinnell's 54 per
cent shooting accuracy from the
floor did not make things any
easier for the Flaming Reds, who
were probably the favorites to win.

The Pioneers rebounded well,
especially considering that Gunnar
Thors, the squad’s tallest player,
sat out much of the game due to an
ankle injury received in the Beloit
contest. The work under the boards
often allowed for a second crack at
two points after an initial missed
shot. Fallon and Haigh combined
for nine rebounds and, sur-
prisingly, the Warner backcourt
grabbed the same number.

the game.

Against Beloit, the Pioneers
were at a disadvantage from early
in the game. Thors was hurt and on
the bench after about seven
minutes and Haigh got into quick
foul trouble.

As Grinnell's low point total
shows, the Buc defense was
tougher and more diiierent than
any the Pioneers had faced before
and hindered Grinnell’s shooting.
The team hit on only onesthird of its
shots. Carl Warner scored 18 points
and Haigh added 14.

The senior forward almost led
Grinnell to an upset Victory over a
taller and stronger William Penn
team a few nights later. Mitchell
said before the game he thought his
squad was in trouble, and, for a
while, it was. Despite poor outside
shooting, william Penn opened up
a 26-11 first half lead by scoring on
rebounds of missed attempts, but

first win

Grinnell held the opponents to six
points in the next six minutes and
trailed at halftime, 36-31. Then
came the John Haigh Show.

Haigh displayed the moves and
shooting accuracy that make him a
good possibility to win the cons
fcrence scoring title. The medium
size crowd rarely had time to rest
their vocal cords as Hnigh shot,
faked. twisted, and drove for 29 of
Grinnell‘s 41 second half points.

Led by Haigh and capitalizing on
most William Penn errors, the
Pioneers kept close ior most of the
second half, but could not pull oven
until a Roger Warner steal and lay
up with 3:42 left in the game tied
the score at 67. Unfortunately, a
combination of turnovers,
defensive lapses and fouls allowed
the opponents to pull away in the
final two minutes.

“If we are going to beat the
better teams in the league,"
Mitchell said, “we can’t make as
many turnovers as we did, We
were passing off even when we had
the good shot , , But i was very
satisfied with the way we played. i
have to take my hat off to every
player.”

Grinnell might have done better
had Fallon and Carl Warner not
fouled out near the end and had the
team received more balanced
scoring behind Hoigh, Only Roger
Warner had more than ten points.
Haigh finished with 10 field goals in
22 sllots and 15 free throws in 16
attempts.

The Warner brothers have
established themselves as the
starting guards and are providing
mucheneeded scoring from the
backcourt, They are averaging 26
points per game, more than ten
points above the average of last
year's guards. Each is an excellent
outside shooter. l-iaigh is
averaging 25.3 points per contest
and early indications are that the
Pioneers may be relying too
heavily on him tor point produc
tion. He and Fallon, a good
rebounder, are the starting for-
wards. The center spot is une
settled, with Knox, Matt Miller,
and Thors all having played there.

Grupplers lose meet
as iniury hurls squad

by Bob liieycr

Tuesday the Pioneer wrestling
team opened its season by hosting
Central College. Central won 33-10.
Unfortunately tor the team, Coach
Mo Hunt was not able to Wrestle
everybody at their respective
weights. This problem centers
around the injured Bo deRosa.
Fortunately deRosa‘s injury will
be healed by the time the second
semester begins.

Since deRosa could not wrestle,
the coach was forced to put 165
pound Dan Mosby in the vacant190
lbs. class. With Mosby not
wrestling at 1581135., Rick Grayson
was forced to move up one
weight class and wrestle in that
spot.The displacement trend
continued as 142 pound Tom
Hawbaker had to wrestle at 150 lbs.
and Loren Rice was pushed up one
weight class to 142 lbs.The last
displacement involved Larry
Schankman who filled in at 126 lbs.
The Pioneers were also at a
disadvantage in that they were
wrestling a team that had already
wrestled a match this season.

Freshman David Greenwald was
put on the spot by opening the
match at 118 lbs. Greenwald did
well in the first two periods and
went into the third period with the
score knotted at G apiece. It was at
this point that nervousness began
to affect his wrestling and the final
score ended up 6-13.

Women drop' opener

by Rich Arnold

Wednesday night the women’s
basketball team hosted the
University of Iowa reserves in the
Pioneer’s season opener The
women dropped the game 114-35
and their overall inexperience was
instrumental in the defeat. Coach
Sandy Hoth said, “I’m neither
upset nor unhappy. 1 expected we
would race problems because of
our inexperience in the iirst
game.” Tomorrow morning at
11:00 the women will tussle
with Coe in Darby Gym.

“The first a to 10 minutes were
pretty ragged as we worked out the
butterflies and tried to adjust to a
lone defense, which we had yet to
practice against," said Hoth,
“After that I thought we settled
down and played a steadier
game." iowa jumped out to a 2st)
lead before Cathy Lee popped in
the first Pioneer points. The
women had trouble with Iowa's

Zone defense including a full court
press and also Grinnell's defense
was a little more lax than Hoth
cared for.

Starting tor Grinnell were Angie
Anderson, Laura Burrows, Cathy
Lee, Minje Martinez, and Chris
Stidley, Also seeing extensive
action were Anne Owen and
Laurice Valentine,

In the second half Iowa came out
in a man-to-man defense which
caused some early problems as the
women had adjusted to the zone
detense previously used. The
Pioneers were able to take more
time on offense and work the ball
around once they got organized,
and this allowed them to take more
shots from nearer the basket.

Sudley led Grillnell with H
points and Lee scored 11 to be the
two Pioneers in double figures.
Hoth said that defensive» im-
provement would be the goal oi
upcoming practices.

Hunt is not worried by the out

that if the team can get deRosa

will become competitive. He is
confident that Grinnell will beat
