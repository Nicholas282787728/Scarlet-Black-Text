end’ college where students go out to
Minneapolis or some big city over the
weekend. We have a very close-knit com-
munity of students and faculty here. The
teachers care forthe students. I had avery
cordialrelationshipwith mystudents and
most of them have reciprocated. I get lots
of letters even now from students who
have long graduated and have become
established in their careers. Out of the
blue someone writes to me that l was in
such and such class widi you in a certain
year. Doyou remembermelltmakesyou
feel good when you think about what
they did at Grinnell and what they devel-
oped into.

5&3: Bob Noyce regarded you as his
mentor until his death. Please tell us
about him.

GOG: (long pause) I think of Bob Noyce
alittle differently. Bobwasalocal student
whograduatedftomthehighschoolhere.
He was our baby-sitter. He helped mow
the lavms, worked on the car. When he
won the Charles Draper Prize [U. S.
government’s parallel to the Nobel Prize
for Outstanding contribution in engineer-
ing and physics], he asked me: “Would
you like to come to the Black»tie dinner
with die President?” It was wonderful to
knowevenafterallhisaccomplishments,
he still remembered what Grinnell didfor
him.

5&3: Here is one question that I abso-
lutely have to ask you. Every ﬁrst year
studentwho comes into thesciencebuild-
ing stares at the perpetual motion ex-
hibit in the museum. How did the mu-
seum start?

GOG: Well, early on when I came here
[Grinnell]. the countrywasgoing through
a depression. Basically the college at that

time did not have any money. So we had
to improvise a lot. I had some Very inter
esting students at that time. They worked
attheshop, workedinthelaboratory, and
helped build the apparatus. I did not
want to throw anything away. So I stoned
to accumulate it. When I retired in 1972,
we had a lot of them that we put into a
case for display. Thus the museum came
into being. I sort of collect old equipment

anyway.

5&3:Somepeoplearguethatpurephys-
its is dead. Everyone wants to doresearch
in applied physics now and not much
emphasis is laid on ﬁmdamental theory
since pure physics has almost reached a
point of saturation. At Grinnell most
studentstakepliysicsbecausetheywould
like to become engineers someday. What
are your feelings about that, and what
can Grinnell do to stimulate interest in
theoretical physics?

GOG: First, physics isnotquitelike chem-
istry where there is a chemical profession
and a chemical industry. You are eithera
physicist or an engineer. Bob Noyce was
listedin Who’s Whaasan engineerl People
tend to Lhink anyone from Cultech is an
engineer, But all his work was in pure
physics So as I look at our graduates,
most or them are not ’physicists.’ For
example, George Simon (poianto Simon’s
picture) later became an astronaut, al-
though all his training was in pure phys-
ics.

Now, the second part of your question.
Yes, lpreferaphenomenologicalapproach
to physics. I gave a talk on that last fall.
That’s my motivation. I think the English
havea morephenomenological approach
tophysics than we do. We mostly dwell on
applications, which makes things a little
difﬁcult. Physics does not need to be difﬁ~
cult. The beauty of physics lies in its sim-

plicity.

S&B:AlmostallGrinnellgraduatesface
the problem of Grinnell’s relative ano-
nymity Willi respect to the Ivy league
colleges and universities in their Search
fora/'01). What can faculty do to facilitat
the transition ofGrinnell students into
the corporate world or in the academia?

GOG: Most of the placements come
through the contacts that professors pass
on to the students. We have students at
ArgonneNationolI,ab0ratory,atCaltech,
and at many other renowned graduate
schools. I think we at Grinnell do a lot
more forstudents in lerms ofplacements
after graduation than most professors at
the big universities care to do.

When I ﬁrst came to Grinnell, this was
a classical liberal arts program and that
was very limited. Students often asked
whethertheirliberolartseducationwould
come to any good use. So I started the 3.
2 program, which incorporates the best of
both worlds, and many students have
beneﬁtied Ii'om it. I think we do much
more for oursttitlents than the large unir
versities in that respect.

5&3: Finally, what are your current
liablries?.<ire you writing any articles or
papers?

GOG: Yes. In fact, I submitted a paper
recently to the American journal of Phys-
icswhichhopefullytheywtllpublishsoon.
I do not think that my article Will be as
much ofa hitas Profe Case's article on the
swing. But yes, I am writing some articles
on the history of Physics and hope to
publish them in the future.

5&8: Professor Gale it was a pleasure to
talk to you. Thank you for sharing your
experiences and valuable insights with
us. Thank you.

 

 

To the Editor:

Tuesday May 4. Dean Duke informed
the Noun Program in Women’s Studies
Committee diatLhe1993-94budgetwould
be cut to 3 10,000. After the November 24,
1992 meeting (the third Noun Meeting of
the year), the committee was urged not to
spend more than 310,000.

Over the past several years, the Noun
budget has been $20,000 each year. The
carefully rationalized and
documented proposal for euers w
the coming year was for j the Ediior
$24,060. This administrar
tive action puts the Noun Program and its
future speakers, sy'rnposia, and events, as
well as its support for inaugural student
internships, conferences, and corspone
sored activities in jeopardy.

1993-94 planned programs and speak-
ers include Patricia Hill Collins, Hortense
Spillers, Sara Suleri, Margaret Randall,
possibly Governor Ann Richards, the
Women in Development Symposium,
sponsorship of strident conferences, and
the inaugural student internships. All
these events would be in jeopardy.

The goals of the Noun Program are to
explore feminist scholarship, to increase
understanding of international femi-
nisms, and to explore ways in which the
study of women is being transformed by

§~
Elw

new perspectives on race, class, and gen
der. In the past Noun programs have
been prestigious and very well received.

Successful events sponsored by Noun
thisyearincludetheSymposiumonSexual
Communication, VoicesofAsianWomen
Symposium, Rural Community Crisis and
Social Action Symposium. Speakers
funded in the post include Gwendolyn
Brooks, Paula GunnAllen, Gayatri Spivak,
Barbara Harlow, Maria
Lugones, Angela Carter, Jes-
sicaMitford,EleanorSmeal,
Diane Wakowski, Cherrry
Muhanji, and Susie Bright to nameafew.
Noun also funded student initiated re-
search and development of the Sexual
Assault and Harassment Advocacy
Program.Grinnell College expresses a
commitment to the ﬁeld of Gender and
Women’s Studies.

The success and growth of the Noun
Program should be recognized and re-
warded with continual and consistent
ﬁnancial support. Instead the Noun bud-
get has been reduced by more than half,
making the majority of Noun program-
mingimpossible.DeanDukejustiﬁedthis
cutbystatingthatthefundswillbemoved
from Noun to the Gender and Women’s
Studies (GWS) Depamnentfor“curricular
development” of the concentration. The

 

Gwsconcentrationandtheprogramming
provided by Noun are integrally related,
and each critically important. GWS con-
centrators and all students and faculty
interested in this ﬁeld beneﬁt from and
requiredevelopmentofthe concentration
within Grinnell, and access to prominent
feminists, theorists, writers, scholars, his-
torians, journalists, editors, scientists,
economists,andﬁlmmakers fromalarger
world of feminism and activism.

The community should not have to
choose between these two nor should
they be placed in competition. it the cole
lege is truly committed to Gender and
Women’s Studies, both the Noun Pro-
gram and the concentration mustbe fully
funded. We are asking that the College

space. In the last 18 months, the theatre
department has spent over eight lhOLir
sand dollars or its production budget to
make it easier to function in the theatre,
Gordon said.

"That’s the cost of two main stage pro-
ductions. Nobody has helped us. We're
the ones getting the catwalk and the sinks
to try to make is reasonably functional.
The sad part about the trade-offisthatwe
don’thave that money toworkwith when
we do productions so education suffers ”

A few years ago, the department re
ceived a grant for new lighting equip-
ment, but the current building doesn’t
have enough power to run it.

”There are some h'gh schools in this
area with better facililies than ours,” said
Gordon.

In the proposed Fine Arts Building up-
grade, the theatre department VVIll not
receive a new theatre, but improvements
will be made on the existing one.

"We are stuck with the basic design of
Robert’s Theatre. We will get a new light—
ing system, grids, anew floor, a new sense
of a masking system. But it's like putting
new upholstery in an old car—it will be a
lit‘ilemorecomfonable,butitwon’tchonge

major components ofthe budget, such as
changes in student fees. Then the entire
trustee board gives ﬁnal approval of the
budget.

In the last 6~7 years, the college hasn’t
had a budget deﬁcit, according to Clay.
"Wetrytolivewithin ourmeans,"hesaid,
"...We can’t afford to do something now
that is going to be adverse to Grinnell ﬁve
years from today."

Next year, $225,000 is earmarked for
research; the college’s utility bill alone
will be around $1 million.

About55%ofthecollege‘sincomecomes
from tuition and fees, the endowment
kicks in another 32%, and grants and
private gifts make up the rest of the rev»
enue.

While comprehensive fees went up 6%
for next year, ﬁnancial aid and scholar
ship budget increased by 11%.

The college’s endowment keeps tuition
costs from rising too greatly, said Clay.
Gnnnell's endowment, valued last week
at $382 million, grew from invested gifts
made by benefactors such as Joseph
Rosenﬁeld. College policy prohibits cut
ting into the endowmentby spending too
much of it. Grinnell spends 4.5% of the
endowment’s three-year average value.
This%age is less the amount of interest
and dividends earned, so that the actual
value of the endowment continues growr
ing.

“The goaloftheendowment is to main-
tain this institution forever,” said Clay.
