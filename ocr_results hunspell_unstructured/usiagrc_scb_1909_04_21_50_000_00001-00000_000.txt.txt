SENIORS CHANGE PLAY.

"The Road to Yesterday" Sillmllllllﬂl
for "You Net-or (Jail Toll"~A Ito-
mzllltlc Four-Act Drama

Although the Senior play for this
year has been previously announced in
these columns as Bernard Shaw‘s “You
Never Can Tell,” the rommittoc
charge has this week sccn ht to make

in

a change and now announces that the
class will prcsent “The Road to Yes-
Lemmy,“ a play whose author is un,
knouu.

The play is a modern romantic lira,
ma or four acts, calling {or eight to,
male and six male characters. The
ﬁrst and fourth acts are set in the
year 1903 and the second and third in
the year 1503, both in England, The
plot is a very interesting and unique
one, telling of a‘ young girl with n
craze for mediaeval romance, who vis-
its a painter's studio in England where
a mediaeval picture is being painted,
She falls in love with the model and
at the end of the ﬁrst act tails into a
deep sleep. The second and third acts
represent a dream, all the characters
passing beioro her in ancient romantic
costumes. in the fourth act she awak,

ens and all ends happily.

Many exchanges are coming in
which contain very laudable comment
upon the Grinnell College Glee Club

and its concerts.

group of Western men prominent in
public life who have in the last few
years done much in service of the

ed on to serve.

In public life Governor Folk has had
a somewhat unique career. He was
ﬁrst elected to office through the short:
of a machine, Soon after he had taken
up his duties as dist ct attorney he
began his famous Crusade against the
graiters in St, Louis. After success
fully prosecuting his cases against the
St. Louis grailers, he was made gov-
ernor of Missouri and in that position
he has set a new standard in the ad-
ministration oi public ofﬁce.

Mr. Folk is a. national ﬁgure, it noted
reformer and all eloquent speaker, and
his coming to Grinnell at that time
will make this part of Commencement
week a notable one.

\‘olopcd that she was highly regarded
as an instructor and a performer, she
was engaged.

A more popular choice could not have
been made than that of R. H. Lyman.
Mr. Lyman is a graduate of iowa Col-
lege in 1907, and was universally popu-
lar for his personal qualities and his
ﬁne abilities as a singer, being barl-
tone soloist with the Glee Club for
several years. He bns studied vocal
music in Des Moines, and with Holmes
Cowper in Chicago. He has been very
successful the past two years as head
of the school or music of Franklin Ac-
ademy, Nebraska.

to donate $500,000 towards a. Baptist
University to be established at Okla-
homa City.
