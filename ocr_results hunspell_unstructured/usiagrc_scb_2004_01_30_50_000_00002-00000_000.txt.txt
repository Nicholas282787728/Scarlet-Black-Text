lNSLab computers, internet
access recently slow

Checking email and browsing the internel in lNSLab may lake students
longerthan usual as ITS works to remedy inconsistent problems

by Leslie Boyadjian

Srudcnts clinching :mail between classes may ﬁnd
themselves in a time crunch as INSLnb experiences tech»
nical dlmculllcs. Since (lit: return from winter break,
ronnrcring to nnd opening email has sometimes taken
longcr in INSLab than In other L s on campus,

Difficulties wiih lNSLnb include both internct probr
lcms and general machine problems Bill Francis, head
or lnformnrloll Technology SL-IvIcL-s
(ITS), agreed on Tuesday rlrar all pro.
grams using the lnrcrnct rrorn
INSI.:l> had becn slow for about It
day. UC Chiis Moscng ‘04 said he’s
noticed problems In particular mm
chines rather than problems with the
lab in general.

Francis believed slow computer
problems in INSLab might be trace-
zblc to JAVA software installed on the
machines, which “conﬂicts will] the
operation oftlic mail program."

According to Mark Watts, ITS.
ITS is investigating lilo sorrwaro and
sorup on its mornings, “we have
done a rooplr orrlmngos in theWin-
dows conﬁguration that secmcd. for awhile, to have
been helpful," he said, “but time has shown that wasn’t
rirr only problem. We are actively lnvosrigaring the
prnolrrn and hope ro have lr resolved in the rim few
days.”

Although ITS is attempting ro ﬁx the problrrns in
INSLao, they are prorooding carafully. “our understand-
ing and observation Is that other than mail ,. programs
used for classes are working Fine," Francis said. “Since
we don’t wanr ro inrorrupr the use oflnstrucrional sorrr
ware, we are maiong software changes and schtduling
‘roirnngrng' with caution and precision.”

Mosengsccs a solution to the prolslorn arslow com»
purors as very much in riro control ofstudents. “I have
noticed poopio having concerns wlth speciﬁc [slow] com-
purarv," he said. “I would say rlmr it's not necessarily a
connection problem as much as a machine problem rim
nocds ro be addressed,"

Because orrlro low security settings on rhc Compul»
ms, stuclL-nrs nro able to download sorrworo onro the ma»
chines. This software can slow the
computers down,

ITS keeps a copy (also known as
an image) orwnar belongs on a par-
ticular compurcl and can remove
what doesn’t bolong, but Moseng says
that “no rnnrror how many times ITS
comcs in and rnragos the machine,"
the problem persists when students
return and download the sorrwaro
ngnin. "lfpeoplc knew nor to install
srnrrir rrnglrr solve the problem," he
said.

Computer
speed: an
informal test

$&B staff members
found that time
required to Check email
was varied widely. On
Tuesday, the longest
lagin time for Outlook
Web Access was 23
seconds in the Noyce
Science Center. The
shortest time was four
seconds from a dorm
room. It took only
seven seconds to login
in INSLab.

Overall, logging into
Outlook took longer
than logging into
Webmailr Webmall took
only ﬁve seconds to
login to in Noyce,
where login was
slowest. Opening a 3K5
amail took vary little
time in both programs: '
up to three seconds in
OWA and never more
than one second in
Webmall.

Wednesday afternoon
was a different story.
In INSLab, it took a
staff member 75
seconds to log into
OWA and 99 seconds to
open the same 3K3
email as the day before.
