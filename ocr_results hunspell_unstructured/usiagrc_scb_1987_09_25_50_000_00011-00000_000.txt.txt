The Grateiul Dead released their
iirst studio album in quite a iew
years, “In the Dark," this sum-
mer. With it they achieved their
iirst pop radio exposure since their
iorrnation in 1965. Well, we've all
heard and hated “Touch oi Gray”;
now it’s time to see what else this
album has to oiier. Unfortunately,
it’s not much,

The Grateiul Dead have achiev»
ed most or their lasting success on
the basis oi their extensive touring,
The Dead are essentially a live

citing live act, the Dead recorded
the basic tracks or the new album
in a live setup on the stage oi the
Marin Veterans Auditorium in San
Rafael, Caliiornia. However,

without the benetit oi an audience
to interact with their music, these
tracks sound as dry as it they had
been cut in the coniines oi a dreary
studio.

The songs are not necessarily
bad; they just don’t do justice to
the heritage oi the Grateful Dead.
At it's worst, this album delivers
songs like “Tons of Steel” by
keyboardist Brent Mydland, Ex-
cept tor Jerry Garcia’s signature
snakey guitar lines, “Tons or
Steel" sounds more like iiller
material tor a Top~40 album than
the Dead.

Cne oi the most annoying
ieatures oi this album is the use oi
sound eiiects like train sounds on
“Ton oi Steel" and motorcycle
squeals on “Hell in a Bucket.” This
extraneous garbage is the type oi
highgloss production technique
that ultimately cheapens this
album. in iact, the overall sound
oi the album is over produced ior a
band like the Dead, The Dead
sound is iar more simple and down
and dirty to require the treatment
it receives here.

All is not lost, however. There are
a iew bright spots on this record.
The haunting “West LA.
Fadeaway" is a chugging blues
number with a phased vocal track
reminiscent oi “Shakedown

Street." Also good lwell, better
than the rest) is the closing track,
”Black Muddy River,” a nice,

easy, slow blues tune,

Could this album herald the New
Age {or the Grateful Dead and rock
music? Well, “In the Dark” is
nothing too complex, just a bit or
easyrllstening rock and roll with
groves barely interesting enough
[or the unquestioning listener to
get lost in.

The Dead really have no
business releasing studio albums,
All new material should be record-
ed live in concert, when the band is
and its best, and he released in that
manner. For those of you who
“discovered" the Dead this sum-
mer with “Touch of Gray,” find
the nearest Deadhead and ask to
borrow one oi the many bootlegs he
or she owns. It's the only way.
Take it easy, but take it!

how mad you are that they don’t
