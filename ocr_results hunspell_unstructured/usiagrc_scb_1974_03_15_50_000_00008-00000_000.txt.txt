IM B-Bull: Time For

, by Rich Arnold

Dibble/Cowles and Loose were
crowned champions of the North
._nd South Division respectively,
both sporting spectacular 11-1
records. They are the favorites
to meet in the finals of the play-
offs and that game would be too
tough to call, even for this sea-
soned observer. In their only
meeting this past season Loose
edged D/C. Well, on with the
final summary of IM regular
season action!

D/C clinched first place by
winning two close shaves again-
st hot and heavy competition.
lanmn/Smith fell, 42-39, as
Dennis Marley popped in 20 and
Wayne Wiley‘s two free throws,
his 20th and 215i points, with
_4 seconds remaining, enabled
D/C to overcome Off Campus,
4746. John Haigh, who edged
Greg' Fallon for individual sea-
son scoring honors,tallied 86 pc-
ints in Clark’s Swins ofthe week.
Clark blitzed allcomers With an
- impressive offensive show. Haine
es was drubbed, 82-48, Norris,
52-38, and Read, 75738. Clark
looked to be invincible. They
play D/C in the first round of
the playoffs.

L/S, led by Glenn Cushing and
Tom Goetz, embarrassed an al-
ready red-faced Main/Mears te-

, am('?), 51-25.Younkers outdefen-
sed L/s, 26-20, and out-smart
ted the Profs (which ain‘t two
hardl), 42e35, boosting them
into a second place finish. Mo
Hunt and Charlie Dike combined
for 31 of the Profs points, but
it wasn't quite enough.

Loose, after losing their first
mine, never lost again, winning

DES MOINES, IA‘ - Grinnell dro-
pped its second ice hockey game
in twoweeksSaturdaynight,1073,
in Des Moines Ice Arena. Both
defeats were at the hands of
Graceland, now 2t3. One of Grs
aceland‘s losses was'atthe hands
of Creighton, tonight's opponent
for the Pioneers.

In Saturday's game, Graceland
took command early, leading 2-0
after the first period, and 7*!)
after the second. The fireworks
started, at least‘for Grinnell,
in the third, and final period
Mark Dickinson, who had tall”
ied twice in the opener a week
earlier, gave the Pioneers their
first score, alssisted by Captain
Al Frey. That made it 10-1,
ﬂavor of Graceland.

Soon after Dickinson's goal, Gre

of stiff checking near mid-ice,
Dave TenEyck found himself spe

shoulder dislocated. Dickinéon,
a native of Des Moines, left the
ice to direct TenEyck to North

The Pioneers continue to Suffer
from lack of Administration sup-

'port. While the Graceland squad

is given $800 annually to cover
expenses, the Grinnell squad has
gotten $40 for one night of ice
rental (in Des Moines) and nine
pairs of hockey pants. The play
ers have already had to shell out
$100 for ice and referee rentals,
net to mention transpornation co-
sts between GrinnellandDes Mo-
ines.

The Grinnell Hockey Club has a
lOt of drive and has endureddES'
pite great obstacles, but it needs
financial and spiritual help. A few
hundred dollars for the club is not
beyond the capabilities ofthe Cole
lege; a few more fans in the stands
wouldn't hurt either.

Dave Wright grabbed firsts in
two events, and Dave Raul) and
Jim Brilcs contributed winning
efforts, to give the Pioneer tr-
ack team a second place finish
in a» triangular meet held Wed
nesday in the PEG. winning the
meet was the strong all-around
William Penn College Track Cl-
ub, with 123 team points. Grins
nell followed With 80, While the
Rams from Cornell settled for
a last place 47 point effort.

Wright got his two wins at the
outset of the meet, taking the
long jump with a leap of 20’7-
1/4" and the triple jump with
4'3’lti/Z". It was the best per-
sonal outing of the indoor sea»
son for Wright, a seasoned juc
mper and a perennial high pl-
acer at the MAC Conference fi-
rials.

Briles, who has also lettered in
both football and basketball, ea-
sily won the 1,1100 yard run, sh-
owing a good kick. Raub, sideli-
ned since pullingahamstringmu»

and the one and two mile relay
teams. Thirds went to sprinter
Caleb Davies (2), hurdler Dan
Hoft, miler Cliff Clusin, and tr-
iple jumper Mike Nadalsky. All
six of Grinnell’s individual 58’
cond and third place qualifiers
are freshmen and sophomores.
Grinnell is hurt in every meet
by its lack of field events com-
petitors. Except for the distance
jumping of Wright and Nadalsky,
the field events have been a st‘
ring of forfeits for the Pioneers.
These events consist of the long,
triple, and high jumps, the shot
put, and the pole vault.

The last indoor track meet is
the Grinnell invitational, Mon»

Diamondmen Anticipate 'Good Year’

Jusl/ as the major league clubs
have taken to their respective sp-
ring training bases in Florida, fir—
110113 and California, the Grinnell
Pioneers have started to limber up
the 01d arms in their home base,
beautiful Darby Gymnasium. Under
the glowofthe mercury vapor lamps,
the team has been running, inrow-
ing, bunting and practicing basic
fundamentals in anticipation of their
home opener again: William Penn
on Tuesday April 2. Granted candi-
lions aren’t the greatest, due to the
horrible Iowa spring weather, but
spirits are high, and the team is
working out indoors, while getting
in all the outdoor work they can
when the ground is dry.

Jolln Flitsch has returned ascoach
this year, replacing Ray Boyd, who
resigned after last season to be-
come Athleiic DirectorforiheGrin-
nell - Newbutg school svstem.
Pfitsch was Grinnell’sﬁrstbasebali
coach when the Sport gained inter»
collegiate slatus (circa 1955).

According to Coach Plitscn, this
year's team shows a lot of promise
but will have to Work hard and dili-
gently if it is to be respectable.
The attitude is good and practice is
going very well so iar. The players
are taking a realistic approach, ass-
uming that they need a lot of work
in all areas and in concentrating on
the iundamentals. Piayershavebeen
urged to critically evaluate their
playing abililies and to do extra work
in the areas where they feel it is
most needed.

The team has more depth at most

positions than it has had in many
years. Overall, the defense pro»
mises to be excellent and is pro-
bably the team's strongest poinl.
it is hard to ten how good or bad
the offense will be at this point,
but the pioneers are putting more
stress this year on the bunt, lute
and-run and placeehltling, which
ougth to increase the potency of
their offense. Pitching is a ques-
lion—mark. Last year’s ace, Mike
Levy has graduated, but Piitsch has
assembled a corps of strungearmed
freshman and upperclassmenthaf he
hopes will do a good lob. The only
other problem area is behind the
plate, where the team has no one
with much experience. However, a
couple of “fledglings” are present-
ly doing a very commendable job at
that position, as the search to fill
that gap continues.
