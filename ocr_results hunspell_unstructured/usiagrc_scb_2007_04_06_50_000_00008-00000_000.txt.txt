Problems with domestic life abroad in Ecuador

A Grinnell student abroad relates her personal experiences with those of others in Ecuador, showing how

difficult life is for young women and a

1 was introduced to the prevalence of young motherhood
in Ecuador the day after my arrival My host morhcr crrmcn
drove us to their beautiful Northern Quito home and presented
me to 17-ye1r-old Paloma, "the mother of my son's daughter,"
with a chuckle, as though she acknowledged the situation was
complicated, but not embarrassing There was no sign of my
host brother, Esteban who I later found out 1111 been studying
economics in Spain since September, to better be able to p107
vide for his family when he comes home.

Carmen explained that both of Palomas parents work, so
she comes to our house most days with her daughter Esmer-
alda where her' mother in law” (whom she refers to as such
despite not being married to Esteban) and the family maid
can help her w1th the baby. "She's
just so young, she doesn’t know any
thing," they say about Paloma. And
it’s true: in many ways,Pnlom1 is like
any other teenager: she gossips with
her friends, she eats fast food, makes
elaborate Valentine's Day colleges
for hcr boyfriend and pouts when he
doesn’t call her back. The difference
is that her boyfriend is an ocean away and he's the father of
their child, who hes never met.

One night while we were riding 11. the 111 (Paloma hold-
ing Esmeralda in her lap sans infant seat 1 puzzlingly frequent
practice in Ecuador), a black cat ran across the street. I, in
my nsivctc',1sked if they meant bad luck in Latin Americu as
well. Paloma laughed and said half-joldngly,“How much more
bad luck can I have after hav—
ing a baby?" Paloma loves her
daughter and the mun who will

itselfwas doubtlessly bad luck for her own plans for her life, as
well as Esteban‘s, due to either the carelessness or m‘rseducation
ofscxually active, well-to-do high-schoolers.
Her luck would have been doubly had had
she lived in a rural area, been poorly educat-
ed or oflow socioeconomic class, women for
whom contraception is the least available and
the most unwanted pregnancies result.

Some young women in Ecuador me not
as fortunate as Paloma. In small, rural towns
where the exportrboom ﬂower industry has
taken root, indigenous community leaders
blame the rise in plantation employment for

would trguc this is simply the
price of progress. However,
the fact that families who tra-
d‘it‘ronally spent most of their
time raising their children and
subsistence crops are more
likely to divorce or abandon
children when they seek employment outside the homc is me
than coincidence. To s11y nothing of the lack ofmalernity leave
for women in some foreign owned companies or, worse, the
pesticidcs which scriuusly damage their reproductive capa-
bilities, unborn

abortion and their otherwise successful natural family plan-

personally encountered, across ethnic and class boundaries, are

to a young male cousin and the conversation turns to breast-

politely, contributing to the conversation when he can.

Ecuador's Congress passed 111w that affords all women the
11ght to choose how many children rhcy should have, as well
as when and if to do so. It’s a shame that a new constitution
is set to be written in the coming months. as instability and
partisan politics have prevented the establishment of any type
of rule of law Until one is established, the notion of female
reproductive choice, even with regard to basic education, will
