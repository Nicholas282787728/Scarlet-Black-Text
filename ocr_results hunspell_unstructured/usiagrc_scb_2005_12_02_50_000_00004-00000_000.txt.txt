From extra-terrestrial to submarine

Aliens bent on world domination; quirky, deep-sea adventures and the triumphant return of director Wes Anderson

War of the Worlds (PG-13)

Usually, in alien invasion ﬁlms, we see gigantic ere
plosions rearing apart landmarks, some secret, under-

. ground government facility planning a counterattack
and hordes ofpeople running from laser cannons. But
have you ever stopped to wonder about those scream-
ing masses? What's their story?

This approach is what separates Mai o/zic ii/ot/t/t
from most other movies in its genre. The main chair
acters have nothing to do with retaliation against or
perpetration ofthc alien invasion. They don’t infect
the mother ship with a computer virus, They don't
sneak in a nuclear weapon to kill all the invaders (“1,
though they do stop an inconsequential tripod). Run—
ning for their lives, they're just like every other person.
But during this invasion, there aren't many places to
run to.

Tom Cruise plays Ray Perrier, a divorced shipping
yard employee watching his kids for the weekend.
He is a pretty likeahle guy, but somewhat irresponr
sible. He obviously loves his kids, but he has no idea
how to relate to them or take care of them. His son
is rather standofﬁsh, and his younger daughter often
takes complete responsibility for herself, not seeing
Ray as or enough for the job. Ray (with a general
Tom Cruise, no-matter-what-happens-I'm-going-
(Orkeeprsmiling demeanor) tries earnestly to connect
with his children.

Then, aliens invade. After a “lightning" storm,
huge, three-legged contraptions rise from the ground
and start blasting people into ashes. From there, Ray
and his family move from place to place and try to
survive. People are mean, frightened and unwilling to
help each other along the way.

From the guy who made such uplifting movies as
Schindler-3L1}! and pro-alien movies like ETand Clare
Encawii‘trr, mir- a/z/ae World; is surprisingly uncharac-
teristic ofsomc orSpielherg's past work. Nonetheless,
its slightly depressing and cynical overtones ﬁt the
him well. Yes, the ﬁlm technically does have a happy
ending. It you are familiar with the original book or
movie, it won’t surprise you. If not, it may come as a
surprise,

Don't be mistaken: there are scenes of alien de-
struction, and they're all pretty neat. In a particularly
morbid scene with a nice take on the heat ray, Ray
runs around his town, covered in the ashes of his
friends and neighbors.

With sccncs such as these in mind, ask yourself
what you're looking for in an alien movie. Ifyou want
a lot of destruction, see Independent: Day. If you want
something even more low key then this him, see Signr.
With impressive special effects and an emotional plot
line, Wm tit/1: World; falls between these extremes
and does so with grace.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (R)

Once again, Wes Anderson makes me question
what I am doing with my life. Rather than making
me feel guilty I wasn't raised a child genius, starting 20
or more clubs in high school or becoming an amateur
criminal, T/ie LyeAqnnlit will! Sim zi'rraa forced me
to ponder, “Should I give it up for scientiﬁc explulrr
tion and adventure on the high seas?” In his fourth
film, Wes Anderson gives his characters depth equal
to or surpassing those in his former films. Anderson
also cultivates novel themes and depictions (such as
profuse violence and cartoon animals) that are lacking
or absent in his former films,

The oceanographer, adventurer and entrepreneur
Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) plans to avenge the death
of his former partner, eaten by a shark, Zissou «Sr
sembles a group comprised of Ned Plimpton (Owen
Wilson), a young airline pilot who claims to be his
son; Jane (Cate Blanchett), a sophisticated, pregnant
journalist, and Eleanor Zissou (Anjclica Houston), his

cally clever dialogue, distinct chnmctei portrayals and
quality music and cinematography in this film. He
makes LI/‘Z'ﬂqurlzir into an action ﬁlm while keeping
his style intact. I once read that Anderson culls rI‘lC

musical selections for his ﬁlms before he even wiites
his scriptsl was delighted to hear Pele de Santos (Seu
Jorge, or Knockout ch in City ofGad) playing Forms
guese translations of David Bowie songs throughout
the ﬁlm. Even though I'm not a huge fun of Bowie,
the music was very pleasant.

Despite my glowing description or Hitler/taxman
a: will; Sm» Ziiioii, I recognize the ﬁlm has its draws
backs. At some points, the film made me ask, “Did he
use that line in a former ﬁlm)" Of course, Anderson
is inventive and creative enough not to recycle lines
and scenes in his films, but sometimes he might try
to reach back and evince the mood of some of his
former ﬁlms’ scenes. Although he has acted in the last
three Anderson movies, Luke Wilson is nowhere to
be round in Lymph/ii, and his absence is diappoin
ing, as he is usually the most poignant character in
most Anderson ﬁlms:

In spite of the few qualms l have with the ﬁlm,
I am amazed that Anderson has directed four mass
terpicccs. With his innovative and persistently clever
films, Anderson has illmostjoincd the ranks of Kuror
