Arnold-Forster Traces. Attempts
of America to Establish Arbitration

Discusses Peaceful Means
of Settling Problems
of World

By WALTER nowury
Tracing historically the atr’
tempts made by the United states
to formulate peace treaties, w.
Arnold-Forster, British laborite,
presented his fourth lecture in the
series on international relations
Thursday night in Herrick chapel.
He spoke on “Peaceful Settle-
ments of International Disputes."
1n telling of what the United
states has done since the last war
towards peace making, he spoke of
the conflicting forces working for
arbitration and for isolation.
isolationist Forces

Difficulties of securing ratifica—
tion of arbitration treaties have
been due party to the constitution
al history of the United states,
he explained.

In reviewing the attempts made
by the United states in formulat-
ing a system of arbitration for the
settling of disputes, he pointed out

Arnold'Forsler Alters
Date of Thursday Talk

W. Al'noldrFol‘sLel', British
laborite, who is delivering a se-
ries of eight lectures on inter-
national affairs, will give his
regularly scheduled Thursday
lecture on Wednesday evening
instead of at 8:15 o'clock in
Herrick chapel.

The date and time of the lec~
ture was changed in order to
avoid a conflict with the con—
cert of the French violinist, Gi-
nette Neveu, scheduled for
Thursday evening. Mr. Arnold
Forster Will give his Tuesday
lecture as scheduled at 7:30
o'clock in Herrick chapel, ac-
cording to Charles E. Payne,
professor of European history,
who has charge of arrange-
ments.

that the first effort at such a sys
tom of arbitration by this country
was the Jay treaty with Great
Britain in 1794.

Senate Lllerieres

After several attempts at peace
treaties were thwarted by the sen-
ate, a pact was finally made with
England and France in 1903,
through the efforts of the late
Elihu Root," he asserted. “The re-
mains of that treaty stood in force
for a period of 20 years between
America. and Britain."

He stated that in 1910 President
Taft proposed a new draft, but
that it was rejected by the senate,
He pointed out that in 1914 con-
ciliation treaties were drafted,
which succeeded in dodging the
Senate, and that, in these, there
were to be committees of inquiry
and report before any resort to
war.

Germany Refuses

“These treaties," he said, "were
proposed by this country and were
accepted by England, France, and
other powers, but Germany rc-
fused,

England Logs

He said that, although the call—
servativc government then in pow-
er in England, considered accept-
ing the Kellogg arbitration agree—
ment, the new labor party, which
came into power about that time,
decided to wait until the United
states resolved to make a real ar—
bitration treaty.

In the inter-American arbitra-
tion treaty of 1929, he declared,
Charles Evans Hughes was an»
ions to further the cause of Com<
pulsory arbitration to the fullest
possible extent. He added that
President Hoover, however, did
not ratify, and the problem lay
untouched until a compromise was
reached three years later.

 

u¥—_,
He pointed out that, when Hoovr

er accepted the compromise, the
plan fell through when the Senate
rciected it on the grounds that
there must be an agreement by‘
and with the consent and advice
of the Senate.

In turning to America‘s part in
the World court, he declared that
in 1599 at the Hague conference,
the United states failed when it
pressed for an international court.
He pointed out, however, that they
succeeded in forming a panel of
judges

Success or court

“Has the World court been a
success?” he asked “My answer- is
yes and no." ,

He explained that the court has
been used in many cases with conr
plete success and with failure and
illustrated by mentioning that the
court has had 6'! cases and 2t
Judgments, out of which judg-
ments‘ have been given both for
and against Franco, England, Ger-
many and other powers.

Hem- Little of Court

“In spite of the fact that the
court has functioned properly," he
asserted. "we hear little of it, in
England as well as in the United
states. But we know all about
Mrs. Simpson.” He added that it
has saved England from war in
two to four important cases.

Turning to the League council,
he declared that the council has
dealt with a number of disputes in
which it has succcded and failed.
He illustrated by telling of the
ultimatum Greece sent to Bulgaria
in October of 1925 and of how
Bulgaria appealed to the League
for help.

“After the League council was
summoned,” he said. "negotiations
were carried on which prevented
war, There was a certain power
which prevented that waria de—
nationalized power, the only effec-
tive power,"

Mr Arnold-Forster will give his
fifth lecture in the series next
Tuesday evening in Herrick Chap»
e1.
