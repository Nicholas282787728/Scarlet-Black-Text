END OF THE SEMESTER: It is fantastic that we are nearing the conclusion of
yet another semester, but hell week is upon us, caffeine intake is on the rise,

and students are extremely stressed out

Wing Night is dearly missed

Wing Night—everyone’s favorite night of
the year—used to come once every two weeks.
Then it cums once a month. Now it comes once
a semester? Give me a break! You don't need a
student initiative to know that Grinnellians love
their wings. All you need is well, nothing, to
know that the line at Wing l\ight last week was
the longest (and most excited) it‘s been this year.
People waited ill, 15, 20 minutes just tor wings,
The lady taking p-tnrds stud it was the longest
she's ever seen it. Whose idea was it to take away
Wing Night?! It's obviously the single most
popular thing thnr they don't have regularly. Do
people prefer shepherd's pie, pearl barley, bacon-
root pilaf and lentils to wings? Obviously not.
This kind ofidiocy cunt ny anymore.,,but how
could it'cvcl', without wings?

Administration accessibility

There has been some intense change in the
bureaucracy of Grinncll, and, perhaps this was
naive, but I thought it would result in a more stu-
dentnfriendly, accessible administration.This was
false.This ye r it seems that whnr was once n pun
is now in: ciously incompatanThc prortttion-
ist attitude in hiring and promoting employees
and faculty is unfair id often abusive to stu-
dents, and n firing po 7 that punishes students
by sending away qtlallhed, popular professors is
incomprehensible.

Dodge, dip, duck, dive, dodge

Dodgcbnll is the true American past time be

forc,it makes sense for Ciriiiiiell to fund dodgeball,

Gtinncll s amidst a financial crisis, it is time (or the
athletic director to step up and trim the (at; getthe
boring teams out otdodgeball. Gi'innell has a long
tradition, or encouraging tun through inrrnnurrl
competition but when teams in the league obsessed
with winning stand against the back wall, iefuse to
throw the balls, only catch the other teams balls,
nnd support communism, this makes competition
infuriating. That is why it mikes sense to stop
funding these tcsuns by wasting my 5350 student
activities fee and allow the school to put our budget
towards more lucrative investments like showing
The Dark Knight again at Hunts. So Grinnell, die
ball is in your court, make a move, nnd don't sirnd
against the back wall.
