From Smith Airicn to South
Carolina (Arista AL4044) By Gil
ScottHeron and Brian Jackson
with the Midnight Band.

This album renews the efforts of
the poetrlyricist Gil ScottrHeron
who was iormerly known lrom his
hit The Revolution Will Not Be
Televised and displays him as a
suriacing arranger and composer.
The album‘s political connotations
set aside momentarily, one can
gaze in awe as ScottrHeron and
Jackson move from fast cuts such
as “Johannesburg," and on into
ballads such as “A Toast To The
People,“ and retain a consistent
mood throughout both songs, Scott-
Heron’s usage of the minor Sixth in
his harmonies on “The Summer of
'42” leave you unsatisfiediwllieh

and his words reflect the same.
Through both the lyrics and the
musical arrangements found on
this album, illusions of a ‘Brighter
Day‘ (to coin a phrase irom one of
his earlier albums) are thrown out
to you, along with a certain distinct
energy to motivate the most
apathetic thinker around.

As a social reformer in 1975,
ScottrHeron steps beyond the
standards at unorganized,
unresolved issues, and replaces
them with constructive, positive
thoughts of the future. In an at-

its meeting November 16.

What does Title IX really mean
to Mortar Board, and to Friar
the campus’s honor society ;
men? In the iuture, the t o
societies will probably share one
large co—ed pool at candidates, but
Mortar Board will remain distinct
in two ways. As stated above, its
purpose will still be to promote the
advancement of women in society,
and secondly, it is a nationally
organized group whereas, the
Friars are a local society.

Tuesday evening, DeeemberQ,
Mortar Board plans to host all of
the campus’s female faculty, staff,
and administrators to a holid‘
dessert at Grinncll House
