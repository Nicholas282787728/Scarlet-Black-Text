' fie; This Week in Joint Board

‘ Wil Contreras ’06 explained to Joint Board reasons for the
need to reform the way students vote on initiatives because “initia—
tives right now face a lot of‘bureauctatic’obstacles,\vhich in the end
make it harder for students to change life on campus" The reform
would maintain the minimum of the “yes" votes required for an inir
tiative to pass but stops the inclusion of the “abstain"votes with the
no votes for purposes of passing an lnltiative.The current status of
abstentions, he said, counts them as votes of negations. The initias
tive was tabled until next semester.

* senators Nora Skelly ’08 and jan Koszewski ’02 sponsored a
resolution supporting more airport shuttles. Joint Board resolved
unanimously to increase the frequency of shuttles going to and law
ing from the Des Moines airport at the beginning and end ofbreaks
and that students would be responsible fora part of the cost oftheir
individual transportation

*The board voted unanimously to adopt a resolution sponsored
by Linn Davis 08 that calls for the creation of a campus space
Allocation Board that would be invested with power to determine
the use of space on campus left open by the opening of the Campus
Center.]oint Board recommended this board be comprised ofstaff,
faculty and students.

‘ President John Bohman '05 said that at the end of the year, a
vote will take place to keep or ditch the presiding officer position
for the following year. Joint Board voted unanimously to keep Tim
Billion ’03 as the presiding officer for next semester.

 

 

SGA Survey shows 54
percent approval

The results of SGA’s first online survey came out
last week.

Just over 300 students participated. 55 percent of
students thought that SGA is doing a goodjob while
32 percent were not sure or had no opinion Close to
11 percent of those students who voted disapproved
of the way SGA is doing its Job

SGA President John Bohman ’06, welcomed the
results of the survey. “I‘m not going to expect that 90
percent otpeoplc think we are doing a good job," he
said “Fifty four percent, 1 have nothing to compare it
to, but I m oka. ”

Bohman said he was more concerned with the
students who had no opinion and the students who
felt SGA did not represent them.

Chris Ochoa ’06, SGA vice president and Presis
dent of Academic Affairs agreed with Bohman, “We
weren’t really surprised by the results," he said. “Gen-
erolly,I think they look good, butI don't know how
much we can read into them, given that about 300
students participated."

The SGA online survey had 32 questions with the
option ofsaying ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘not sure’to each.

that the dorm-based system of sub

to meet the needs of non-drinking

Many students who live in sub

support for the idea, ﬂaws and all.
Kershaw resident Danny Zamora 'os
thinks that the problems are conser
quences of the newness of the idea.
“Subsfree can work if administration
is organized,”he said. “I think subsfree

We just need a couple ofyears for peo-
