Day or Prayer.

The Day ot Prayer, which has,
u tiI tlrls rear, been observed on
p day, “ill be observed this year
on Suntluy, Febltlary rr. ln nrnny
way 5 it is to be regretted that the
day his heen changed, yctiur gen
crnl convenience and for more ulr-
ivcrsal observance it is deemed
best by the International COITTmIK'
tee to nralte the change.

This day is important for sttlr
dents because of what it stands for.
when the (lay is rightly observed.
it should have great meaning and
valuable results for the student
world. On this citry the men and
wonrcn in practically all the Instir
tutimls in every land where schools
have made their way, are united in
their prayers and interests for the
great body of young people in the
colleges and universities ot the
world. The results of such spirit-
ual unity ct interests should bring
not only local blessing, but should
havennwcrsal signiﬁcance.

On Sunday we will have with us
Graham Taylor, of Chicago, who
will give two addresses to the stue
dents on that day.

Graham Taylor is too well
known to the students of Iowa
College to need any introduction.
He, being a man who is giving a
large part of hrslife in the endeaVr
or to work out the problems of
life by the christian llllv of love,
and having great strength and ins
ﬂuence with students. will add
meaning to our day here. It is alr
ways an inspiration and help to
meet a man whose whole life is
going out rn an earnest, sincere
and consistent endeavor to em-
bodytlle principlesofjesus. Such
a mall is Graham Taylor, and we
will all do well to listen to him and
meet hinl while he ls here.

The other meetings of the day
will be announced later.
