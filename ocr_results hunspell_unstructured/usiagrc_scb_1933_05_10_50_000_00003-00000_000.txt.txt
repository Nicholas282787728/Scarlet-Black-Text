anell Speaks

Cecil F. Lavell, professor of history

of thought, spoke on scholarship.
Professor Lavell said, “Scholarship
is the search for the heritage of opens
mindedness and truth, the quest for
the causes of things. It is the temp-
tation.to know more, think objective»
ly, explore mental wildernesses and
‘ind navigable trails.
. “Someone has said that knowledge,
to be justified, must contribute some—
thing to the good of the world, but
the search for truth," Mr. Lavell he-
lieves, "like the love of beauty, is
its own reward.”

Mr. Lavcll explained that scholar-
ship is not everything, but said, “We
would do well to otter sincerely the
prayer: ‘Give me beauty in the inner
soul. May I reckon the wise to he the
rich.’ "

GRANGER”

" ELL, it’s like this. Back in the old
days, when men wore high bats and

vfrock coats, they had plenty of lime to
think things out, and they had Sense, too.
They used to sit down on a log and take

the lime to Whittle

their tobacco from a

plug, to be sure of having a cool smoke.

"In those days, a man named Wellmau,

right here in Quincy, 111., made about the
best tobacco you could get. He knew how

to keep the ﬂavor ﬁne and mellow.

"Well, sir, the people who make this
Granger Rough Cut acquired Mr.

Wellman’s method,

known how the old boys used to Whittle
their tobacco to make it smoke cool. Yes,

and they must have

sir, this Granger is the real stuff. The

same mellowness and ﬁne ﬂavor that
Wellmari used to band out to his friends.
And it’s whittled into big Shaggy ﬂakes
all ready for the pipe. rRough Cut’ they
call it—‘cut rough to smoke cool’ is the
best way I can describe it.
