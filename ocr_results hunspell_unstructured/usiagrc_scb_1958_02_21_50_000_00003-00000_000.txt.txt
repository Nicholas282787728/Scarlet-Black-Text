done toward preparation for
limited war within the exist-
ing defense establishment. Kis-
singer also stressed that nat»
ional survival oiten depends
on will as much as on power,
and that present criticisms
should not be permitted to en»
guli long-range sell—confidence.

In a pointed criticism of a re~
Cent lecture series delivered over
the BBC by Gearge Kennan,
former American ambassador to
Russia, Kissinger stressed first
that a total dis-engagement of
folices in Central Europe Could
be fraught with danger, and
second, in reply to Kennan’s
highrrnlnded pronouncements on
American limitations, that it is
impossible to Choose between
defense and selfsimprovement.

It is necessary iirst to pro-
vide adequate defense and
concurrently Seek Self-im-
yrovement. This does not rule
out, but rather demands, con-
stant positive proposals with
which we can live and which
are appealing to neutral paw-
ers, the lecturer asserted.

Kissinger Concluded by sug»
gesting that a broad, forward
looking policy, in which We
clearly show what we are for
father than merely What we are
against is absolutely essential
for the maintenance of Ameri-
can prestige abroad.
