On November 4 and 5, SGA held a blood
drive In Gardner Lounge which drew an
impressive number of students willing to
donate a pint of their blood,

The drive, which is held each spring and
tall, brought out 186 Grinnell students. 155
of whom actually gave blood According to
SGA student coordinator Tom Bar-
thelmess, this was a fairly successiui turr
nout.

“We were pretty happy with the number
of people who came, considering only 64
people signed up to donate,” Barthelmess
said.

Usually 60 percent oi the people who give

drive.

The SGA sponsored the event in coopera»

Several registered nurses were present
and were responsible tor drawing the
blood.

The SGA plans to hold another blood

McConnell noted,

McConnell also noted that FOG-Fast
works well because students do not carry
much cash and would probably be unwill»
ing to make a cash donation to charity,
which would make collection for groups
such as this semester‘s recipient, The
United Way, much less successful. This
semester, the FOG-Fast raised a total of
over $750 for the United Way.

Use Your UC‘s

by Eric s. Johnson _

As a student of Grinnell, and therefore a
computer user (gasp). you ought to be
familiar with the functions of the Student
Academic Computing Committee (SACC).
It is your link to Grinnell College Com-
Duter Services (GCCS).

We advise GCCS on the opinions of the ‘
students; controversial changes are
always in the making. GCCS depends on us
to be representative of you. and to voice
your opposition, plaudits, or desires for
improvements,

A current example: plans call for the
removal of Rainbows from Burling and
replacement with terminals. leaving the
Rainbows in the new YMCA as the pir-
mary location for studentaccessible
MASSrll use. How do you feel about such a
change? Will it facilitate or be detrimental
to YOUR use of computers for whatever

application? (See the last issue oi iN-
PUT/OUTPUT for further background.)

Our current roster includes Megan Dur-
ning as our Chairperson, Leslie Andrews,
Tor Hough, Eric Johnson and Brian
McMahon as User Consultants, Daniel
Thorburn as studenteatelarge, and
Stephanie Redman as SGA rep

Four of us. Dan, Eric, Megan, and Tor,
then go on to serve as voting members of
the Academic Computing Committee,
which includes faculty and administration.

If you're interested in becoming a
student-atrlarge member (we meet weekly
for an hour), we want a freshman or
sophomore who is NOT a highly experience
ed user. Contact us either through campus
mail (box 6'64) Or on the VAX, user name
SACC.

If you’re a user, please make use oi user
consultants.

also occureo during the frisbee season.
which is often Considered a ”non-contact
sport" The problem, rather. was the
reluctance of the referees to take control.
Dnhltn strongly states, “The oiiicials of
l M '5 had no backbone, allowing
themselves to be intimidated by the
players This year we haven't had many
conflicts, and we don't even have any ref’s.
This shows that in the future we can have
I.M. football.” Maybe without referees
there isn't the inticement to have problems
, the “thrill" from unnecessary roughness
may not be the same without the men with
whistles.

David Steinman, captain of NFC 1N0
Fat Chicks), feels the same way about the
current situation. “It’s obvious that we can
have football without referees and still re
main injuryrlree. so i don’t see why foot~
ball can’t be put back into I M ’5.”

Putting his ieelings behind him, Dahlin
has concentrated on running a successful.
competitive yet relaxed program, His suc-
Cess seems two-fold, as his team, the Herr
shey Squirts, are running in the lead. The
championship is scheduled tor this Sun-

. day. And just maybe there will be other

football championship,

that it is possible to eiiect a change in the
extreme homophobes in the limited time of
tour years. But fortunately they are low.
With the rest of the Student body is the
,great hope for a program of education. The
“moderate” homophobes, though a major
concern. are not the immediate problem.
It is, rather. the extreme homophobes who
have lound it “necessary" to express their
negative attitudes through vandalism, ver-
bal attacks and graffiti .

The administration has made explicit its
Commitment to policing the problem, but
that is not enough. The success of any ac-
tion does not depend on SGA resolutions or
administrative mandates, but the
awareness and involvement of the entire
student body. Get involved: state your opi-
nions, ask questions, make suggestions. Is
it a queston speciiic to homophobia or does
it extend to all forms of prejudice? where
is the line between acceptable and unac-
ceptable expression? What is your own
opinion? How does it relate to the
mainstream and ideal positions? Do not sit
passively While some Committee reduces
the problem to a yes or no question for you
to vote on.
