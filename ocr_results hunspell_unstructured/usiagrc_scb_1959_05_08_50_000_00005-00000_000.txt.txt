e is based, enter all, on a
irely economic ionndationt, let,
e point how these college—,

ucated children or the middle
.sscs, even alter graduation, in
any cases remain of llltlel
lue to the public as a whole.‘

Having been iiiianeed ior
our years by the giits oi the
usincssmen who donate so
irgega percentage oi their
roiits to the support or the
olleges, and having been a
ax on the economy of the
ration as a whole and on their ,
arents. they emerge debtless
tter iour years or high living ,
n the bounty oi the land. ,

A lightslleadcd mob without‘
sponsihility or gratitude. they
in at once to trivolous prac-l
:es, to harcbrained trips to
irope, to dabbling in art stu—
os, to fiddling with typewrit-
s, to consorting with women

ill repute. to composing
eaningless rhymes and Sym-
onies, and, in general, to mak-
g a nuisance of themselves.

At this time they should, in
l right, be hard at work in the
res and oliices of those busis
ss men to whom tliev are so
debted, striving to repay the
nerous gifts which they have
ceive'd.

But, as i said, they graduate
egally debtless, or, in other
ords, without any real inccn~
‘Ve for getting dawn to busi-
ess. Something must he done
o provide some means of rare—
lg xepzyment from those col~
ge students who are witlr
Lit natural gratitude.

A simple debt to the college
one possible answer. This
uld indeed force the grad
to to take employment withi
sound company immed—
after graduation and
make a more prudent

him in- general, But
oh a measure is only a be-
ning.

Placing the student in ’debt to
college leaves room for con—
sions on the part of that in-
tution for such unproductive
d futile endeavors on the
rt of the graduate as grad
to study in Greek, sculpture,
d Tibetan or English history,

In my humble opinion the
introl of the debt, and thus
. the debtor, should he given

the primary source of the
opihil, the business con-
erns themselves: it is they
ho provide the money; it is
cy who should be repaid by
rvice, it not by cash.

hen all these ﬂacts are held
arly in mind, anyone who is

ll see that there is plainly
on - one reasonable course ot
action tor remedying this dew

plorilblu situation.

I propose the abolishment oi
1all monetary aid given by col-l
leges either as gilt or loan, and
indeed all nonmonetary and,
too,

The job or iinaneiiig college
educations would be assumed
in its entirety by thebusiiiess i
corporations oi this country,
acting as a uniiied business
irnnt tor the general good and
prosperity oi the nation, They
would withdraw all their supe
port previously given to the
universities and colleges.

The students would be charg
ed the real cost or their college
educations, a titanic sum. The.
business world would supply‘
the needed capital in the form
ol loans to the student These
loans could be willidi'd
will of \he company, and terms,
and interest could be detidcd on
,bv the united business ~
iacting as one gigantic educations
‘al corporation. ,

In this way, subversive politl-l
cal activities, that perpetual cun~
,cer of American colleges, could
be eradicated once and tor all.
Student unions would be for
hidden as socially unhealthy. as
.mdeed they obviously are, If
lone looks into their more Secluds
‘ed areas or action ,l

The more eccentric vagaries
of the curriculum would be
pruned away. it one keeps in
mind the obvious truth that
the purpose nl‘ education is to
produce nsetul citizens, it is
immediately apparent, indeed,
that very little til the intel—
lectual iroth now dispensed
has any value.

The applied sciences and seine,
oi the social sciences, ‘
sociolog economics (in the-
true tr ition of Adam Smith.§
subjects would be dropped, andi,
it goes without saying), psychol-
ogy, and Industrial Motivation
would be retained, but all othel"
in their place would be ins,ti—'
tuted courses, vocational in the’
highest sense, which would have

 

(A useful hy-product would be
that the protessors noiv teach-1
ing frivulous courses would be,
turned to find employment in
some userul area, such as ade‘
vet-using) ,

It is to be anticipated that as
soon as this proposal is. clearly
scen and adopted (the two will
be simultaneous), we will shoi-t.,
ly attain a stable, beneflctal,l
and prosperous employer—bond»
servant relationship. Some may
