Pines and sterility in higher education

I think it is about time someone ad
dressed the problem of the pianos,
Every hall on campus, I believe, has a
piano. They are. however, out oi tune,
missing strings, even entire keys. and
yet nobody wants to take responsibility
(or their neglected condition. The
general consensus is that it would be
cheaper to Sell them {or junk and start
over with inexpensive bargain pianos.

But then it has been noted-that a new
piano wouldn’t last very long in the
hands of the cutrthroat students, Look
at what happened to that wonderful
Steinway in Main Hall. They had to put
a padlock on it to keep the studenm
irom playing it, but did that stop the
students? No, they had to smash the
lock oil, even when they had ﬂ’ieir own
Steinway just a iew ieet awayl Just
because their Steinway is missing three
strings, has 27 damaged keys, and is so
out of tune it sounds more like a kazoo
than a piano is no excuse. What unear-
thly reason could those students have
for wanting to break into that $15,000
piano? Goodness only knows. Thank
God they moved it over to Lee Cloud's
office. To think of a well tuned Steinway
in the hands of those desperate
savagesl And besides, they could go
over to Fine Arts and play on one oi the
practice pianos Now that‘s how to en-
joy playing a piano, in a five by live
cubicle so small you have to climb over
the piano to close the door (honest),

Is there a solution? These pieces of
junk take up a lot of room for doing
nothing. it they aren't going to be ﬁxed
they should be scrapped and their space
put to good use ta T.v, would probably
be appropriate. given the current ate
titude towards the matter).

Since the school is currently in the
process oi spending millions of dollars
on renovating the dorms, they should at

least consider making the already
sterile appearance oi the new dorms a
little homier with a new piano,

But then making the new dorms
resemble home can't be very high on
the school's list or priorities, can it?
Each oi the new. dorms has identical
doors, identical cork boards, identical
mirrors, identical overhead lights,
identical paints, etc , etc., etc.

It would make an interesting addition to
the archives, wouldn't it? I can see
students so years irom now looking at
some scribbles from the distant past.

But then, tyes, believe it or not) one
member of the Admissions staff com-
mented that ‘5 been tried before:
they just burn it off the walls." Sounds
familiar, huh?

Speaking oi Admissions, has anybody

Would you want your kids

to go here 20 years from now?

Doesn't sound exciting, does it? Other
students don't seem to be too en-
thusiastic about living in wall-board
cells either. In last year's room draw,
Haines closed out ﬁrst, while Langan

(the most recently renovated dorm)‘

tied with Norris and the single-sex
dorms lor last place. what happens
when they're all in last place? Maybe
the school will buy some pianos to keep
the enrollment up.

But the dorms and the pianos are just
symptoms oi a deeper problem. There
is a growing gap betweeen the students
and the administration. in the past year
there have been several bouts between
“us” and “them”; the graffiti in Burl»
ing is a good example. it was literally
war at the end oi last yearigreaso on
the walls, indelible magic marker, even
student iines, The worst part was that
there was no visible effort to resolve the
problem peacelully, The only thing that
kept me situation irom exploding was
the end of school. Even to this day the
battle continues: B&G has resorted to
black paint and the students have
retaliated by iilling most at the
available space with inerasable graf-
liti. ‘

After spending at least $100 dollars on
paint, lithium grease, scrapers. paint
remover, more paint, and hours upon
hours oi labor, you would think the ad-
ministration would give up. Perhaps.
May I suggest a compromise? Why not
put some paper upon on the walls?
There is paper everywhere on this cams
pus—in Fine Arts, in the computer
Center, in the Offices, EVERYWHERE.

noticed a disproportionate number of
jocks running around the school where
“winning isn't anything?" And that let-
ter from Uncle Waldo, SO Waldo and
George want to make Grinnell into a
powerhouse. It sounds absurd but it
looks like they are going to try. ididn't
ask tor more jocks, did you? In iact I
have yet to hear one person say they
were pleased or even nonchalantly
satisfied With the whole alfair. Is this
action in response to some hidden ma-
jority that I don't happen to bump into
very much or could it be on orders
from above? I, {or one, came to Grin»
nell, in part, because they were not con-
cerned with winning, competition, pro-
ving you're a man, etc. it the Trustees
don't start watching what’s going on,
the Grinnell Experience will become
the Grinnell whatfharmafall-itl

But then again. these Trustees are
rebuilding the dorms, i seem to recall
one of them dealing with some
criticism of the new dorms by making
the novel observation that “Kids today
don't appreciate anyming,” What com-
munication gap, huh? They may have
money pouring out of their ears, but
nobody said anything about brains.
Maybe that’s why they don‘t listen:
Money in the Ears Disease, Who hired
this guy Drake, anyway?

it might not seem too serious now;
we’re only going to be here tour years.
But what about the future of Grinnell?
Would you want your kids to go here
‘20 years from now? If you say, ”That
depends," then it really depends on
you.
