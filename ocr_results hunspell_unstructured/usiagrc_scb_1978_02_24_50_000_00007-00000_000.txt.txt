Cagers complete season with 3-19 record

by Russ Winick

An overtime victory at Cornell
last Friday was the highlight of the
Pioneers’ final week of basketball
for this season. It was followed by
home setbacks to Beloit and
William Penn. The cagers’ record
ended up at a disappointing 3-19.

With the depth Grinnell had this
year, everybody on the team was
hoping for at leasta 500 finish To
this observer, the Pioneers’
biggest problem usually seemed to
be a lack of Confidence and poise.
Play was often ragged. and
Grinnell had difficulty putting two
good halves together.

As leading Scorer Frank Orth
and others confessed, the team did
not have a winning attitude. Orth
noted, of course, that it is difficult
to develop a winning attitude when
you aren't winning. But he added
that most of Grinnell‘s opponents
simply came out and played
harder than we did in the 2nd half,
when ballgames are usually won,

The team‘s best performances
were the upset over Simpson last
November and the narrow losses to
division leaders Knox and Mon-
mouth earlier this month. In the
latter two games, the Pioneers
demonstrated their potential to
play head-to-head with virtually
any team in the conference.

Next year is hard to predict.
Only frontliners Joe Kingma and
Gunnar Thurs will be lost to
graduation and the real world.
Thors especially will be missed.
The 6’8" center came on strong in

the last half of the season.

with a few of his patented wit-
ticisms. Basketball at Grinnell, he
intoned, is “a spiritually uplifting
experienceiit lifts and
separates.” And playing here,
Thors added, has made him more
worldly: “I never knew all those
other places in Iowa existed!”

Of the six promising freshmen
who started the season. just three
finished, and only standout for
ward Pat Walsh, who holds the key
to Grinnell’s future, is certain to be
back next year. Strong forward
“Buffalo“ Pat Dalton. who played l
extremely well for the Pioneers
during the latter stages of the
season, and reserve playmaker
Bill Badgio both may transfer to
other schools.

Juniors Bill Knox, Matt Miller,
Charlie Gogel, Roy Shepard,
sophomore Pilsner Guttman. and
Walsh will be back to give the
Pioneers size and depth in the front
court. Returning juniors Roger
Warner, Robb Eyre, and Orth
comprise perhaps the finest trio of
guards in the Midwest Conference.

Warner and Miller have been
elected captains for the upcoming
season. Stating, “We’ve got to play
together." Orth expressed hope
that next year the Pioneers will
finally reach that elusive .500
mark. He pointed out that Grinnell
will be fielding a very experienced
ballclub.

The talent is there. Hopefully

V-ball enters 1st semi-finals

by Dave Blough

The men’s Volleyball club turned
in its strongest performance of the
year Saturday in its final home
tournament, Finishing third out of
twelve teams, the club proved that
it could be competitive.

The Pioneers got off to a good
start as thev crushed Cornell, 111,
1171. Next up was Mason City. The
club dropped the first game, 7-11,
but came from behind in the
crucial seccnd contest to win lZ-lD.

Drake’s entry proved to be no
match for the psyched up Grinnell
club, as the Pioneers swept the
match to finish the morning with a
571 record. After breaking for
lunch, the club came up against a
strong Collins Radio team and lost
both games in a hotly contested
match.

The final round-robin match
against Two Rivers proved to be
essential to Grinnell‘s efforts to
make the semifinals of the tour-
nament. The club rose to the oc-
casion, .winning 11-5, 1177. Mean-
while, Drake dropped h-om con-

tention, allowing Grinnell to finish
second in its division behind Collins
Radio. The Pioneers finished With
a 7-3 record.

In the semi-finals. Grinnell was
trounced, 11-5. 112, by Davie
Lee‘s, from Waterloo, which had
captured its division title with a lo
0 record. llins went on to beat
Davie Lee‘ n the finals to take the
championship of the first Pioneer
Invitiational Tournament.

Coach Tum Latimer was im-
pressed with the club's overall
hustle and agressiveness, two
traits often lacking in the club’s
style of play. Noted for playing
strong games were Mike Moody,
Guy Blalock, and Blair Martin,
Whose hitting carried the team

Swimmers again winners

Women through, men await conference one

by Dick Gilbert

Destroying Cornell last Tuesday,
the women‘s swim team concluded
their 77-78 season with a 5-2 record.
Although the atmosphere was very,
nonchalant, as the Women com-
peted in any event they pleased,
the Pioneers won every race. “It
was a good way to end things,"
noted Coach Peggy Reidesel.

The relaxed conditions Seemed
to spark excellent performances.
In the so fly, Becky Chipman and
Nancy Duteau had personal bests
and in the 100 fly. Ann Cleaver
swam her best time ever Debbie
Fleming also recorded her
quickest time in the 100 free.
Christina Weinberg swam a fine
breaststroke. While Serna Sessa
turned in a smooth, strong so fly.

While the team has a strong
nucleus returning for the coming
year, the Pioneers will lose seven
valuable seniors. School record
holders Sheryl Huntoon, Debbie
Jalowiec, and Ginny Munoz will be
lost to graduation as Will Chipman,
Cleaver. Grace Morledge, and
Renee Johnson. The squad may

lose another dynamite athlete ifs

Margo Wessner leaves Grinnell to
attend the University of Iowa.

Already in the process of putting
together the schedule for the 73-79
season, Coach Riedesel is trying to
line up some stronger opponents,
This appears to be a reﬂection of
her attitude that Grinnell will
again have a solid, competitive
team.

The waves have now settled, the
:season is over, and Grinnell’s male
swimmers’ have compiled an
impressive773record. At the end of
the season the team seemed to be
.stricken by some form of “aquatic
, plague.” and for some meets was
only able to muster up eight or nine
swimmers. In spite of these minor
disadvantages the Pioneers were
able to close out the season with
victories over Knox (68-35). Drake
(67735), and Cornell (57745).

With the conference cham-
pionships coming up next weekend
at Lake Forest, the swimmers are
relaxing and getting psyched up
for the gruelling two day meet.
Leading the Pioneer bid for the
, title will be Brian Jones (in-
‘ dividual medley and almost any
other event), diver Tom Helpens
lstel, Greg Gomez and freshman
standout Karl Koch (both
breaststrokers).

Chris Corton. Bruce Pivar, Jeff
