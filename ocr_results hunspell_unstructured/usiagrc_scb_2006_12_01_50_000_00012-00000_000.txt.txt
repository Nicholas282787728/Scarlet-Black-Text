Burling barricaded in ‘71

“ch Ur El W/ml We Are] BLACK!" read
posters outside ofthc chained doors ofBurling
Library on Nov, 29,1971, when all or most of
the Aflican American students took over the
library. Their reasoning, according to an uni
nmncd SEE writer, was that this “turn [be wily
way 2/13): tau/d bring «Mention lo 11;: may Blnrlv
Jim/mt: me Iliirﬁmrcd ml
[111: tar/I‘M“. ”

At 7:15 am, on
Nov, 29 a group of ap-
proximately 55 students
cntcrcd Burling Library
through a back door
and locked up all the
entrances. Students also
distributed leaﬂets titled “The Black Manr
fcsto."

The students did not relinquish control of
the building until 12:30 pimi, after four hours
or meeting with President chgctt yicldcd
agreement on {our of their 10 demands and a
promise to continue discussion.

There is a tangible
legacy to these stu—
dents' actions, includ-
ing rhe Black Library
in Burling. This week,
Concerned Black Stun
dents commemorated
the 35th anniversary of
the takeover by holding
a candlelight vigil in the library. While some of
the original grievitness were never adequately
addressed, the students of1971 left us with
the more important legacy of their bravery to
speak up in the rats ordissrlmination.
