The Caps’rone Experience

BY TOR lANsON

Finals loom in the near future. Papers hang
from our necks like dead albtrtrosses. This is a
time of year when students withdraw into
rltemselvesnrrd hunketdown to withstand the
coming onslaught. Unfortunately, right now
we have more to worry about than ﬁnals.
Russcll K proposed that Grinncll adopt a re-
quired capstone experience for Grinncll Col-
lege students. He wants to use Fund for Ex-
cellence money to do rt.

Osgood proposes that every student carry
out a capstone research/creative project. I hope
to do independent research while at Grinnell
college, I think the options forsueh research
should be increased. Why, though, make it a
requirement? Osgood wrote:

“i am convinced that we need the capstone

experience because it will be the logical ful.
frllment otour academic program. it is con»

sisrent with our beiiefin the wisdom inherent
in givingstudentssubstantial autonomy itwill
offer prospective students an overall educa-
tional experience that is special, that we genu-
inely deliver, and that reflects faculty values
and the ethos ofthe College."

Forcing a student into a capstone experi—
ence is not consistent with the values of our
open curriculum. The very idea ofa “capstone
experience" or a “ﬁnishing off" violates the
ethos ofour open curriculumWhen our open
curriculum was proposed in 1970, Beryl
crotfeiter, a physics professor, wrote a justifi—
cation for the idea. The clorfelter Proposal is
our open curriculum’s equivalent ofthe Dec»
laration of Independence. It articulates the
temps" that osgood speaks ofthat led the face
ulty to adopt the open curriculum. The
Clotfelter Proposal directly opposes the sort
or capstone experience requirement that

Osgood advocates:

Those of us who favor this sort of re-
quitemcnts statement see a college experir
encc not as the capstone of an education,
but rather as a time to begin the process of
self-education which should continue
throughout life....

We believe that there exists no single
best route to general education for allstu»
dents, and we suspect that enthusiasm for
what is being studied is often more imporr
tant than the speciﬁc subject matter .....

Our perceptions of the way programs
are actually working now lead to the
conclusion that student resentment against
requirements is often so intense that it con»
srirutes a real impediment to education,
with the number of students who are
turned against courses or disciplines by the
act that they are required probably equal»
ing or exceeding those who discover a fond»
ricss for a discipline after they are required
to try it..,.we suspect that in many cases
much ofthe time spent in required courses
is time wasted for both the student and the
teacher.

The freshman tutorial was added to the
open curriculum proposal, an addition that
swayed many faculty to vote for the open
curriculum Some might say a mandatory
capstone requirement is the logical ﬁnish
to what the mandatory tutorial begins. The
tutorial allows students to prepare together
with an advisor for the coming college
years. The main purpose is to acclimate the
student to Grinnell College and prepare the
student with the writing skills needed for a
liberal arts education. It is a course which
emphasizes general skills more than speciﬁc
knowledge, and as such it fits nicely into
the open curriculum, The capstone, howA
ever. requires synthesis and intensive reflec—
rion upon the skills and knowledge learned
in four years at Grinnell. Its main purpose
is not to build skills, but to integrate knowl-
edge in a meaningful and vigorous man-
ner. For this experience to have full value,
me student must be intrinsically motivated
to make the meaningful connections. A stu—
dent not highly motivated and excited by
their research will not have a valuable ex-
perience. it will be much like a required
class: time wasted for both the student and
the teacher. Extrinsic requirements cannot
guarantee intrinsic motiwtion. In fact, the
mandatory requirement will probably re»
duce many students desire to carry out
their projects.

Intensive research projects are quite
valuable for many people, similar to the
value that many ﬁnd in study abroad pro-

grams. We are not required to study
abroad, though. Morc than halfofus do,
and we have a variety of programs avail-
able and an off Campus study office
committed to ﬁnding programs to ﬁt stu-
dent needs. It would be more consistent
with the ethos ofout open curriculum to
shape independent research projects in a
manner similar to out off campus study
program: offcravaricry ofpossibilities that
strive to meet student needs, and make
thcsc choices known and accessible to stu-
dents,

The proposed side effects ofa capstone
requirement are also disturbing. i have yet
to meet a Grinncll student who thinks there
are too many course offerings or believed
his/her tutorial was too small. in fact, i
know plenty ofstudents, myselfineludcd.
who have been closed out of classes they
wanted to take. Complaints like “i got
closed out ofTheorics of Culture and I‘m
an Anthropology major" are all too com—
mon. The limited course offerings are not
just closing out people who are curious
about other disciplines, diey are shutting
out people who vont to major in that dist
ciplinc, A reduction of mid»lcvel classes
would only augment that problem. Grinnell
already is having trouble absorbing the huge
class ofzoor As I complete my third set
mcstcrat Gtinnell, I have had only one class
with less than 25 students. The majority of
my professors have told us that theywished
the class was smaller. Some asked us to re»
consider whether we wanted to take the
class. ‘

The capstone experience is based upon
good intentions, but conceived in a man-
ner that matches neither the_oractical nor
philosophical aspects of me Gtinnell cur»
rieulum. We can have a say on this pro
posal, though. Now is not the time to be
passive or use ﬁnals as an excuse not to par-
ticipate. At the very least, send [osgood] a
short note voicing your opinion on the
matter. It’s a good way to procrastinate. It's
also important to remember that the fact
ulty has ﬁnal say on Osgood's proposal.
During the I970 curriculum debate, StuA
dents attended faculty meetings to voice
concerns and listen. Most faculty and ad-
ministrators from diat time have said that
die strong studentsupport of the open cur-
riculum was important. Unless the faculty
has since banned students ﬁom their meet-
ings, we still have the right to attend. Also,
ifanyonc warts to read die Clotfclter Pros
posal, it is stored in the Iowa Room, and I
placed a copy on reserve at Hurling in file
P-799.

Le’r’rers To The Editor

Dear colleagues and students:

I would like to put in a good word for
Grinncll-in-London which is now, as every
year about this time, recruiting students for
the next fall semester. This is not a program
which should need touting, but it is one of
those things which is so good that you can—
not fully appreciate it until you are there. So,
the next best thing is a testimonial from some-
one who is, or has been, there.

if you are someone with the interest,
stamina, discipline, and space in your degree
program to enjoy arguably the most cosmo-
politan city on earth while succeeding at a
rigorous curriculum focusscd on the history,
art, literature, society, politics, and science or
that city and its surrounding country, you
should seriously consider Grinncll-in-Lon-
don, Ifyou are a once or future Grinnell-tn-
Londoner, faculty or student, who knows
someone who ﬁts this proﬁle, encourage them
to look into it.

This is my third stint on Grian in
twenty-three years, and I ﬁnd it more inter»
esting and enjoyable than ever, We native
Grinncllians have hne adjunct London col»
leagues, including Donna Vintcr and Lisa
Bowers-Isaacson, who also administratc the
program withcnctgy, hospitality, compassion,
and efﬁciency, The program is ideally situ-
atcd, just a couple blocks from Bloomsbury
Square and the British museum, in a b id-
ing with a good lrbtaty, computer faeil es,
classroom and ofﬁces. Prospective faculty will
appreciate that the site rs just a short walk
from great rcscarch collections in the Uni»
versity of London libraries and the Clcgant
new British Library. For those who like to
work out, the program has arrangements with
the U, ofLondon and international Student
House where you can have the amenities ofa

 

highrpriced ﬁtness club for a relatively small
fee.

This year in Phase I a grueling regimen
of classrooms, libraries, museums, other
sites, and exams has been punctuated with
wide participation in enlightening curricu-
lar trips to Cambridge, Oxford, Kipling’s
Estate and Brighton, Wordsworrh‘s Lake
District and Hadrian's Wall, Bath and
Stourhcad Garden, The Dorset ofThomas
Hardy, Tours of Southwark, the Tower of
London, the Asian-African-English Com-
munity ofSouthhall, the Houses ofParlia-
ment, and much fine theater, including
Richard III at Stratford-upon-Avon. On die
extracurricular side, many ofus went as a
group last Saturday to a Premiership foot-
ball match between Charlton and Leices-
ter City, and we are looking forward to
Thanksgiving dinner as guests of the
Vinters. And Phase II is yet to begin! Be.
ware that you may suffer culture shock from
this program . when you go back to the
campus. Give it some thought.

To the Editor

We read with interest your trontpage al-
u'clc on the Natural Iaw party (October 30).
The studenrmembersofthe party reported that
me position of the NLP “just made sense" and
used “proven means" to solve problems. We to
grer mat the Sender and Black did not delve
more deeply into the NLP. The NLP was
founded bya group offollowcrs ofdre Maharishi
Mnhcsh Yogi. Many orthcse followers, includ»
ing Dr. John Hageiin, cited in your artide, are
airiliatcd with rescirdr on me “Global Maharishi
Effect." The Global Maharishi Erect hypoth—

diaes that a relatively few people practicing
transcendental meditation may cause actions
at a distance via a “coherence in world con-
sciousness.” According to an article on this
subject (Maharishi’s Program to create World
peace: Theory and Research, by Orme»
Johnson and Dillbeck, 19873, the Maharishi
discovered that “as one percent ota populae
tion practicing the TM program, or an even
smauer number, on the order or the square
root of 1% ofa population, eollccdveiy ptac-
ticing the TM—Sidhi program is sufﬁcient to
produce a measurable and holistic influence
ofhannonyand integration in the entire popu»
lation.Thismmns that a group ofonlyslighdy
more than 7000 persons collectively practic»
ing me Maharishi Technology of the Unified
Ficldissuﬁicicnt to createaninlluenceofpoce
for the whole world's population ofabout five
billion." In outer words, a group of medita—
tots claim to change the behavior of other
people, even dose in a different geographical
rotation, without any physical contact, This
claim appots in the NLP party platform in
me contort of several issues, including eco—
nomic and foreign policy (sec wwwnanrnl

As scientiso and skepdts, we doubt
the validity ofdtis claim, and we wonder why
the scarlet schlack article did not mention rt.
We are concerned that students might be drr
vetted by claims “derived ttom scientiﬁc laws
and practice" widrout me necrssary informa-
tion to think critically about me belieis of me

The Madness of Bill Clinton

BY RANDALL LAHANN

This is going to be my last column of
the semester, so I thought i’d take this op—
portunity to discuss someone that's been
bothering me rot quite awhile: Bill Clinton,
His lawyers are going to begin his defense
this week, and I feel like uttering up my own
opinion on the impeachment hearings. Sim-
ply put, I think they should fire him. Get
him out ofthere as soon as possible, Firstly,
let me say that I'm a life long Democrat;
I’ve never voted any other way, But, there
are some issues that have to cut across party
lines, Let me explain. To me it's not a ques-
tion ofmorality. So he had an affair, or two,
or thirty; I don't care. Immorality is some.
thing to which I can relate, It’s the truly
perfect people that scare me. I also don't
feel that he should be impeached because of
a lack or professional ethics. He seems to
be getting the job done; the ends justify the
means. For me, it’s all about sanity I don‘t
think this guy is right in the head.

Sometime in September Ken start rc—
leased his report on his investigation into
Clinton’s afraitwith Monica Lewinski. Igor
through almost all of it, and I haven’t felt
right since then. (If you haven’t looked at
it, I don't recommend doing so, It reads
like a voyeuristic romance novel, but with a
detached coolness that’s just unsettling.)

some parts ofit were relatively predictable.
For example, he was given oral sex while talk
ing on the phone to a couple ofcongressmen.
Sure it’s more than a little bit decadent, but it
fits into my image ofClinron as a powcrrob»
sessed misongyst, And besides, we’d be with»
out the entire Republican party ifwe rid our»
selves of politicians who ﬁt that description.
Anyway, the report just gotstranger. The high
light, ifyou can call it that, is when Monica
tells how she and the president were getting
intimate when he unwrapped a cigar and put
it inside ofhct. That’s not just weird, it's scary.
Call me old-fashioned, but as a heterosexual
male myself. I’ve always preferred a penis when
I’ve been in situations like diat. I’m all about
creativity, but personally I feel like you have
to draw the line somewhere. To me, Clinton’s
behavior indicates a serious ignorance ofme
necessary cosmic order ofour world. Toasters
don’t go in bathtubs, silverware doesn’t go in
the microwave, and cigars don't go in vaginas.
So it should have been written, so it should be
done. This column has already been graphic
enough, so I won’t go into what happened
next. Sufﬁce it to say that my dreams are
haunted by images of the president using a
cigar like it’s a phallic shaped Tosritio My
point is mat I m not completely comfortable
with this guy being in ofﬁce I m afraid that if
Canada ever mounts a ground war against us
(like i think they will), he’ll try to send sub-
marines into Norm Dakota. The ironic thing
about all ofdtis is d-iat Clinton refused to have
sex with Lewinski because he was afraid of ete-
ating evidence that might lead to people ﬁnd-
ing out about the alrait. You know he’s kick.
ing himself for that decision now.

All jokes aside, it takes a weird person
to do these things, bur it takes an even
weirder one to allow them to be done. Ei-
ther Monica is just like Clinton, or she’s
some sort ofsexual Christ ﬁgure. Regard-
less, they belong together, and neither one
belongs behind, or underneath, the desk in
the Oval Ofﬁce.
