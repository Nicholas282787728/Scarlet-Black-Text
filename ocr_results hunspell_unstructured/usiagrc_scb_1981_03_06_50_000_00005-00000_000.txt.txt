However. not everyone on campus
shares the optimism of the administra»
tion and the Admissions Office. Barry
Hull. associate dean of Student Affairsv
believed, "the college isn't as commitr
ted as they say they are" to increasing
black enrollment. He questions whether
the Admissions Ull‘ice is doing as much
to recruit black students today as it did
several years ago when the numbers
were higher.

Hull pointed out that in the past there
were people in Kansas City. Memphis
and other likely areas who would steer
black students toward Grinnell.
Presently, there seems to be an overly-
narrnw concentration on the Chicago
vicinity. His principal complaint,
however. was that he ”doesn't see a
sustained eilort" on the part oi the ad
ministration to get black students to
come to the college, There have been a
series 01 starts and stops wtth various
unrelated attempts being made and
then given up on too quickly.

Huff‘s view is that there appears to be
no fundamental sense of vision about
where efforts have been and where they
are going iii the |uture, He cited this
"lack oi consistency“ as the primary
shortcoming ol the administration's
black enrollment drive. Finally, Huff
believes that Grinnell should either adr
mit that it doesnt really care about
having a diverse student body or it
should make a truly substantive and
sustained push to recruit the black stu»
dent,

Cliiiot‘d iteid. associate prolessor ol
economics. believes that. belore
anything else. Grinnell needs to ex-
amine and discuss whether black
enrollment should be increased at all,
He questions if having more black
students here would serve the best ma
terests oi the college or at the luture
black students. Nonetheless. Reid feels
that as long as the administration is go-
ing to pursue its present policy oi trying
to enroll more blacks. its eliort should
be a genuine one.

As things stand now. Reid saw "no
real committmentlrom the admin' tra-
tion to admit more black students. He
painted to such things as the lack of a
{ullrtime recruiter devoted to minority
admissions and neglect in lollowing up
on initial contacts with black students
as reasons ior the current state of air
fairs. Reid cites these laults as ex
amples ot the administrations "surr
lace committment' to the enrollment
of more black students. He said that
Grinnell does make a good start by con-
tacting people by letter and providing
catalogs and literature on the college
but the school stops there and provides
no lurther encouragement to the pro

spective black student, iteid also saw
ei|0rts as being too localized and sug-
gested that the drive take on more ot a
national character with greater atten~
iion paid to the "middle-income net
work" oi blacks in large northeastern
cities.

Ultimately. Retd echoed Huff's desire
that Grinnell either engage in a
wholehearted attempt to expand the
college's black population or simply
choose not to. if it decides on the latter
course, Reid would like Grinnell to stop
repeating the same rhetorical claims
that an all-out effort is being made.

Lee Cloud. assistant proiessor ol
music. has no doubts that Grinnell
should definitely intensity its effort to
attract more black students to the Grin-
neil campus He saw Grinnell being
”cheated out of liberal diversity' if
black students are not actively
recruited. Cloud said. as did Huff and
Reid. that Grinnell’s rural location and
its lack at a black community are
drawbacks.

For Cloud the absence of a substan
tial black community here means that
there is an inadequate amount oi sup
port and reinlorcement ot sell lor the
black student. He believes that one
thing that could be done to try to com-
pensate lor this would be to bring in
more minority artists. Cloud also en-
dorses the Spelman exchange as a
worthwhile project. He felt. “There are
many things the two can otter each
other."

Turning to the perspective oi black
students on campus. the optimism.
however cautious. of the Admissions
Office and the administration begins to
wane, Johnathon Nelson stated. Not
enough is being done by the administra-
tion It is difficult to verify whether
they are determined to increase black
enrollment. ’ Karen Culmer. Stonewall
McCuiston and Janet Pelmore all agree
with this sentiment, These students
believe that it Grinnell really wanted to
raise the number of black students on
campus it could, Yet. Nelson question-
ed "whether the administration is Willv
ing to spend more money on this pro
blem.‘

Culmer felt that, although the AdmlS'
sions oitice is doing more this year
than before, they do not lollow through
with their plans " she cited prospective
weekends as an example oi the Admis-
sions Ufi'ice's inconsistency. When
students come for these weekends the
Admissions Office does not always ll'l'
form Concerned Black Students which
students are black so that CBS can get
in touch with them.

Both Culmer and Nelson strongly
believed that "in light of the decline
there is room for black enrollment im-
movement at Grinnell." In terms of the
|uture, Culmer ”finds it difficult to
believe that the numbers will increase

The administration must go out oi its
way to get students, more than just pay
ing onehalt oi a prospective's busfare
{or a visit. lwill believe there is an imr
provement when i see the numbers,"

Nelson, however, emphasized that.
"due to the tact that notenough is being
done now. the option of improvement is
not a possibility."

tin a related aspect McCuiston said.
"recruitment of black students is
centered mainly around the Chicago
area," Pelmore clarilied this by stating
that "the hiring of Marilyn Ratliff to
recruit black students from the inner Cir
ty oi Chicago only proves this point."
Ratliff is the Area Admissions Coorr
dinator. working mainly in the Chicago
area. and she has held the position for
two years. She graduated from Grinnell
in l968 where she was a founding
member of Concerned Black Students.
McCuiston and Pelmore believed, "the
administration IS not attacking the pro
blem correctly because Grinnell does
not push tor diverse recruitment trom
many cities.”

Pelmore Stated, "With a large black
population in the United States Grinnell
should actively recruit black students
with the same degree of success it
recruits international studenBI Both'
Pelmore and Culmer drew attention to
the fact that the enrollment of interna
tional students is projected to reach 100
next year. doubling this year's ligure.

"Possible options open to the ad-
ministration." according to Pelmore,
"are to charter buses from urban areas
to Grinnell in order that more black
students have the option of visiting,"
McCutston said. "a full-time minority
recruiter is needed on campus now,"

Overall, these studenm believe that
increasing black enrollment should be a
high priority oi the college. They would
like to see the number of black students
increase to about 100 students. Yet none
of them are extremely optimistic about
attaining this number in the next few
years. As McCuiston stated, "I have
been at Grinnell four years and all the
administration does is talk . . . not make
noticeable changes."

Clearly. the problem of the decline in
black enrollment at Grinnell is perCelV'
ed differently by the Admissions Office.
the administration, the black [acuity
and the black students The members of
these lour' groups attribute varying
degrees of success to the black recruit-
ment drive oi the past it) years Looking
toward the future, the optimism of the
Admissions Office and administration
is tempered by the skepticism oi the
black students about the ability of the
administration to make any real gains
In the next few years,

Yet, Grinnell's success in aitracting
more black students to the college can
only be determined by lulure enroll»
