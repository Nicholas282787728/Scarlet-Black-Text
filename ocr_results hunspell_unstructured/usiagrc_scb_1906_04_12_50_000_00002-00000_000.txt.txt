HE athlete has been hibernat-
ing these long months, looking
forward to the day he could don the
ilappers and try the strength of his
muscles in the out door sports.
Spring has some at last and he is out
working consistently to developed the
best in him in order to satisfy his
Sportlnan's instinct as well as to win
honor and glory ior himself and his
College, In his enthusiasm for the
sport, he Lhinlls athletics: he talks
athletics: he dreams athletics. Alas‘
In his ideal realm he forgets his
studies. ivhab then? The meet which
he ioolred rorward to winning is at
hand but when the time to act, comes
he ﬁnds that horrible condition star.
lug him in the face which absolutely
prohibits his entering the contest.
Then is nhen the joys oi springtime
assume the gloomy aspect and when
the monotony of winter would be wel<
comed with delight.

But why do we suggest this line or
thought? 15 it because We Wish to
solicit. leniency toward the athlete?
Not especially so. We ﬁrst Wishto
take the precautions step of warning
those that need the warning, that
there is a rule in the institution that
requires a Certain standard of scholar-
ship for competition in athletics.

The requirement in itself is not un-
reasonably high and no student who
attends to his business Ought m be
barred from athletics On account of it.
Our standard or athlete scholarship
this year alinuso removes the necessi-
ty of Lhislaw. Nerer since the rule
has been in effect have so few men
been prohibited from taking active
parts in athletics On account of their
class standing. We have nothing es-
pecially Lofear thereiore on that ac
count. But, now that the other by-
issues of college activity Such as Ora-
tory, Glee Club, Debating. etc.. are
Sutliniently fresh in the minds of all,
we think the time especially ripe to
ask the legislators of the institution a
question which We believe is a fair
one, namely: \Vhy place acondiiian
on athletes and not on other men er:-
gaging in work aside from their
studies which requires as much or
moreof Lheir time, El. practice Which is
just as disasterous to their studies as
athletics. It is not our purpose to ex-
pose the standing of men who take
part in these other by-lssues but We
have from sulheiently good authority
that in some cases the grades or these
men would not allow them to oompete

in athletics. We fail to see the justice

of this discrimination.

There are La men who are members
of the Young Men's Christian Asso-
ciation and about half that number
who regularly attend the association
meetings. This may not at ﬁrst seem
a large percentage and it is not as
large as it should be, yet it certainly
bears out. the statement most forcibly
that the Thursday evening meetings
are the strongest feature of associa
tion Work for developing the spirit of
Christian fellowship and winning men
for Christian service which is the aim
or every Christian organization.

The Young Men's Christian ASSO-
ciation ought to reach men where
they live, touch their Vital problems
and above all stand for the highest
kind of manhood. It does not always
do this but it aims to do it and must
continue to do so as long as it fulﬁlls
its real mission here or in any other
school. Its largesb work is to bring
into absolute sympathy the social life
of the college With the spiritual life in
such a way that both shall be lighten-
ed.
