Two new RLCs hired, two left to go

rw REBECCA PARK

Wh=n students return to campus next fall, ﬁrst~ycats won't be
the only new faces, as four new RLCs will be joining the college's
student staff. The college contrnnes to search for two candidates
but has already ﬁlled two spots by hiring Jim McCiuthy, Lcadcr—
ship Development Coordinator at Canisius College and Christo-
phcr Bylone, a graduate student at Eastern Michigan University.

McCarthy, who is currently working and living with students
in the halls at Canisius College in Britralo, NY,wrll likely be placed
in sniounker. Bylone is currently attending graduate school at
Eastern Michigan University completing his Masters of Arts in

- Educational Leadership.

The students who interviewed McCarthy and Bylone were
generally positive about the new hires. “I was really struck by [Me
Carthy's] easygoing nature. He came across as very gcniiinc,”Al-
yssa Penner’w said, an SA involved in the hiring process.
Loosehead HSC Brian Davis ’09, who also took part in the
hiring process, attended dinner with McCarthy and said that he
easily ailtilicd his basic RLC requirements by being approachable
and easy to ndk to “When i was at dinner I felt like [McCarthy]

was it friend of mine who I had known for a while," Davis said.

One concern when seruehing tor stall is the adaptability of

or haven't necessarily have had the philosophy orselt-governance,
so it's been a little bit frustrating. so now I’m able to be in a place
that will allow me to kind otpractice what 1 preach."

McCarthy expressed similar sentiment. “I'm interested to get
to know sclf~govemarrcc to see it in action," he said,

McCarthy said he yams enthusiastic about getting to know
Giiiinellians and was impressed by the students he met. “The stu-
dents were brilliant they were very intriguing, interesting," he '
said. “You can't really pigeonholc'thcm in one group."

Bylonc also said he is eager to work with students and look
ing forward to the job’s challenges. “I know without a doubt that
they are going to challenge inc every day, and that is probably the
most etciting part about this job," he said. “And 1 want that as a
professional. I want the students to challenge me to make sure I
am being the advocate they need and mint."

While there are two more RLC positions that need to be ﬁlled.
no concerns have been expressed about being able to ﬁnd qualiﬁed
candidates. "We still have several people coming to campus, so I’m
optimistic," Andrews said.

Loosehead r-rsc Brian Data's '09 compared this year’s job
search to the multiple RLC search two yeiu-s ago. According to
Davis, dus year they were able to start the hiring process earlier.
and have been able to attract more candidates. “I feel like we've
been Alch to choose more who w rcttrrilli' itcr'cstcd in, rather
than taking someone who is icadi \d blc , to Come,"

l’cnner said she is conﬁdent it rout having nC'l' RLC _ on count
