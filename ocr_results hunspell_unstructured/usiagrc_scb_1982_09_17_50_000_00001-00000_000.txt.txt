Adelmon addresses foreign issues
Says divestment, sanctions ineffective

VII— mt

by Scott Sutherland

South African divestment, third-world
nuclear proliferation and the Soviet
natural gas pipeline to Western Europe
were three issues that Kenneth Adelman
discussed in an interview following his
convocation addrss here Thursday, Sept.
9.

Adelman, the United Statts’ second
ranking delegate to the United Nations and
a noted authority on African issues, receiv—
ed his doctorate from the School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University follow-
ing two and one-half years of research in
Zaire. Among other posts, Adelman has
served as assistant to the secretary of
defense during the Ford Administration,
In 1980, his book African Realities was
published and proclimed a “unique con-
tribution to both African studies and na-
tianal security analyses.”

one of the realities of modern—day Africa
is the issue of South Africa’s apartheid
policies. The effects of these policies have
given rise to demands that foreign
business interests withdraw their in
vestmenls from South Africa. Pressure on
American business and educational inr
stitutions such as Grinnell to Lake a stand
on the divestment issue is growing.
Adelman said it is important for an institu-
tion to take a stand on the issue, but he
does not feel that divestment is the proper
course of action to change the situation in
South Africa

”South Airica is not me worst offender of
human rights in the world,” said Adelman.
He acknowledged that South Africa is the
only violator of human rights in the world
which bases its policies on racism and sup-
ports those policies with an abhorrent
system or apartheid. However, he stated
that South Africa is not the worst offender
of human rights in terms of cracking down
on such basic freedoms as religion, speech
and assembly. It is not the most repressive
country in the world, Adelinan said, not is
it the most repressive country in Africa.
He sees the business community in South
Africa as the group that will aid blacks the
most, and questioned the effectiveness ofa
move like divestment to bring about
change.

Kenneth Adelman, a 1967 Grinnell
graduate and deputy United States
representative to the United Nations,
discussed the United States View of cur
rent issues in the United Nations at the
Grinnell Scholar’s Convocation in Herrick
Chapel on Thursday, Sept. 29,

Among the topics Adelman covered
were the growing cynicism among
members of the U.N., the emergence of
blocs and the objectives of the U.S. in the
U.N.

Adelman identitied increasing cynicism
in the U.N. as the organization's primary
pitlall. He gave examples of recent U.N.
behavior which contradict the ideals set
forth in the U.N. charter signed in San
Francisco in 1945. The conflicts brought to
the UN. are very selective, said Adelman,
and many important issues that should be
addressed are not, For exam ». such con»
flicts as the Iran/Iraq War and the
crackdown in Poland were not seriously
considered. In many instances, Adelman
said, U.N. proclamations are simply ig-
nored. Adelman added that the U.N. is
essentially a forum {or nations to spew
rhetoric without fear of retaliation or
retribution by other nations, thus render-
ing most ol the organization’s actions
meaningless.

community is the most progressive com-
munity in all of South Africa . . . I have
never meta black South African, who lives
in South Africa, who is for disinvestment of
outside investors. Disinvestment will only
hurt South Africa’s black community. And
I don’t think it's our responsibility to act
holier than the ones who have to endure
under apartheid. I think we should work
with them," Adelinan said,

Adelman stressed the idea that outside

. interests, the South African business coma

munity and South Africa’s black popula
tion can work together to advance that
country’s blacks within South African
society.

“Black South Africans want a situation
where they are cut into the political action,
and, by God, they should have it,”
Adelrnan said. He added that the black
South Africans' wishes for integration and
the chance to be treated as human beings
are two goals which nations like the United
States can work toward.

“To say that disinvestrnent, because
we’re so holy and so moral about it, is the
right course or action is wrong," Adelman
explained, “because it‘s South Afrlcan
business that is helping them. Disinvﬁt-
ment to me seems absolutely crazy.”

Adelman went on to say that any form of
economic sanctions against South Africa
would be ineffective in changing that coun-
try’s policies toward blacks. “Economic
sanctions have proven to be a bust at
reform of a political system," said
Adelman. He cited Cuba and Rhodesia as
instances where economic sanctions failed
in their attempts to influence the political
philosophies of those nations. Economic
sanctions today have a 100 percent failure
rate, Adelman said, and South Africa
would be no exception.

Adelman cited the emergence of blocs in
the U.N. as another problem which
prevents it from mking decisive action,
Blocs, he said, are the “main reality” in
the U.N. today. Black African, Central
American, East European/ Soviet and
nonraligned blocs effectively limit the
number and severity of actions that na-
tions may impose against a member or
members of a bloc. Adelman pointed out
the folly of such a system, where
“alliances" are made between nations on
the thinnest of pretense, often in the name
of rhetorical similarities.

The United States, according to
Adelman, is trying to bring about change
in the U.N. To change the nature of UN.
rhetoric, to inluse a sense of responsibility
into the U.N. members, and to try to shed
its label as the enemy of the non-aligned
nations are but three attempts by the U.S.
to sway the thinking of member nations,
Adelman said. He suggested that in the
near future the U,S. may be divorced from
the U.N. and vice versa. He stressed that
the decisions made by the U.N. over the
next it) years will be instrumental in
determining whether it will endure as a
body responsible for the settlement of in
temational conﬂicts.

Although the UN. continues to hold
economic Sanctions as a threat to South

Africa, Adelrnan is convinced that the
threat will remain just that v a threat.
“The U.N. always talks about it, the
United States and the Europeans say ‘no
go,’ and so the African stams act very
disappointed and think it’s a collusion with
racism," Adelman said. “Then, these
African states turn around and Walk home

very relieved at night because many of .

those countries are economically depen~
dent on South Africa.”

According to Adelman, the African nan
tions or Mozambique, Botswana,
Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia, Zaire, Gabon
and Senegal are becoming increasingly
dependent in varying degrees on the South
African economy. Any economic boycott or
South Africa, Adelman said, would “ab-
solutely devastate" the economies of a
number of Southern African nations.

Adelman discussed sanctions of a difr
ferent sort when he addressed the issue of
Western Europe's funding of a Soviet
natural gas pipeline from Siberia. Western
Europe, he said, would become too depen»
dent on the Soviet Union for its energy
needs. Adelman claimed that Western
Europe’s dependency on Soviet energy
across the board would be equivalent to
the United States' dependency on the Per-
sian Gulf, “That's just too much," he said,
“especially when they have a choice. l
think there could be a development of Nor-
way's natural gas a lot more. There could
be a lot more alternatives to this than
financing the Soviets."

Adelman was particularly irked by the
[act that ﬁle German Bank was giving the
Soviets credit at half the cost that it was
givmg German companies, in effect short-
changing itself and the German economy.

“The Soviet Union is the biggest threat to
Germany in the world today," he said.
“Why the Germans would want to give the
Soviets credit at half the price they give
German companies, I just don’t know."

Adelman rejected the theory mat a pro-
ject like the pipeline will help bring about
better EastrWest relations, He maintained
that western economic dealings with the
Soviets only abet the U.S.S.R., and he gave
an example whereby a western national
built trucks which the Soviets purchased.
The tmcks, said Adelman, were used to
carry troops when the Soviets oven-an
Afghanistan.

One of Adelman‘s complaints concern-
ing the present state of the UN. is its
reluctance to responsibly address many of
the crucial issues facing the World today.
Among these virtually nonaddressed
issues is the proliferation of nuclear
weaponry or, more specifically, the pro
liferation of third-world nuclear
weaponry.

According to Adelman, the subject oi
restricting third-world nuclear
capabilities is met with a barrage of
criticism from the developing nations, who
strﬁs that nuclear arms reduction should
begin with the superpowers. The consen-
sus of most member nations in the U.N. on
the subject of nuclear proliferation is one
of “passing the buck." “Most countria
feel it's not a problem of their own,"
Adelman said. He added that there is
disagreement among members concent-
ing just who to blame for the problem.
Some nations point to NATO, some to the
Warsaw Fact and some consider it to be
the problem of the five permanent
members (France, England, U.S.A.,
China and the U.S.S.R.). “No one ever
says that it’s a problem their government
has to do something about. It’s always a
problem of someone else "

“Nations behave as goodrwilled, as pet-
ty, as kind, as vicious, as envious, as far-
sighted and as selfish as human beings
do," said Adelman. “The whole range of
human emotions and traits that you study
in the classics are manifested in nations.
Nations are no better or worse than we
are.”
