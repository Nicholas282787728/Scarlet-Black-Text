The recent quarantine regulation of
the taculty restricting students to the
immediate vicinity of the campus. and
prohibiting them the doll'llvtou'u dis-
tricts need not be taken as cause tor
any alarm, Grinnell college has an
unusual health record. No cases or the
epidemic have been reported'at the
quadrangle, Only" four cascs have
even been suspected at the barracks.
The health record or the college has
never bden better. The quarantine
was a request troin .uayor lvhitc to
protect the college students lroiu any

possibility of taking the disease from

ton nspeople.
Sonic cases have been (ound in the

city of Grinnell, but they have not
been of the most dangerous type.
The quarantine in Gi-innell comes
alter practically all the schools in
Iowa have been closed, or quztrzm»
lined. Iowa University has been
quarantined loi- oiei- a week. times
has over [our hundred cases or the
epidemic. Drake Unive ‘sily has been
closed and the students sent home.
If the proper precautions are taken
regarding the ordina , rules of health.

there need be less danger thali usual ,

lroin common illnesses, and none at
all trom a Spanish inﬂuenza epidemic.

A communication appearing in this
i iic calls the attention oi the girls to
the reeonmreudation put bctore them
at their last league meeting regarding
the change in hours at the Quadrangle.
The recommendation .eame as a re-
quest ii-cm the faculty alter they had
accepted the league ruling pertaining
to Sunday dates, and the consequent
change in the Sunday tradition or the
college.

This e nunicatioii written while
‘the new ruling is under consideration
is worth reading and thinking over,
It presents the sides or the questlon
and leaves the decision to the girls. A
decision made without due thought
would he worth nothing.

Both stirdents and faculty are
anxious this year to have students
do "the dccidiug" tor themselves. It
the decisions are advised. they are
worth consideration. It they are nasty,
impulsive, they are as yalueless as all
siieh decisions are. Any change in
the regulations at the Quadrangle havc
the best interests at the college and its
life at heart. Think them over before
you make up your mind. But which-
ever way you decide, think ﬁrst.

Another change in the regulations at‘
the quadrangle is now under discusr
siou and will, in the near_ lutuie, be
brought hctore the women ior docisV
ion. The proposal is that the closing
hour on Friday and Saturday nights
be changed irom elcvcn to tcnetlllt'
o'clock.

tit hrst thought this may scorn to he
a big request, but is it so uni-ensoul
able, alter all” or all the collcgcs or
her true, the closing hours at Grinnell
arc the latest, Tire maioi-ity or schools
have the leiHllil’ty‘ closing hour and
there are a imiubcr who have the ten
o'clock hour. This gives outsiders
the impression that Gl'illucll's social
standards are lower than those of:
other schools. Do we want the good,
name of our college so besinirchcd
when the giving up or a halt-hour's
time two nights of the week would
keep it clean?

As iar as this matter concerns the
men of the s, A. T. C. their visits at,
the quadrangle nuist terminate at Lcnr
thirty or thereabouts, anyway, in or-
der that tlioy may be hack at the pain I

racks for roll-call at tou-tortynve. The i
change would simply make it less dit.
ticult tor them to obey this order.

Assurance is given us that air “7‘
tension or time woiild be granted
whenever there was a special collcgc
tunetion and when students in large
numbers would he out together.

Such a change would not he pro»
posed did not the tacultv tool that it
we emphatically nece at so, let
us tudcnts, whose best interests they
have always at heart, weigh the prom)»
sition caieiullv and make such a rural
i show that we also are
