0 Change for the Better.

When a campus organization has reached
the point where it no longer carries out the
functions for which it was created, then
either it should be abandoned, its constitu—
tion should be changed, or it should be
publicly known that it no longer represents
the principals toward which it was origin—
ally devoted.

In a meeting last Thursday, the Tonll
men openly charged the Friars with dis-
crimination and partiality, asselting that
the organization had become a dormitory
social fraternity.

Those are serious charges for an organ-
ization purporting to have its membership
based on scholarship, leadership, .and chars
acter.

Except for vague references to ”secret”
meetings, Friars have yet to justify many
of their appointments, nor have they e.
plained why others‘ were left out of the
organization, ,

Let the Friars prove that they select

 

, members according to their constitution, or

let the constitution be amended to let the
Friars be known as a social fraternity.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Reviewer Calls Performance of Mass
Best fol) Yet by Oratorical Society

0 A Beskirted S. & 13.

With the announcement of the new editor
and business manager, the Scarlet and Black
enters upon a novel, beskirted phase of its
existence.

The social implications of both a woman
editor and business manager are broad and
vast. Does it mean that the beer-drinking,
cigar—smoking editor of the past has given
way to coke-sipping, cigarette caressing
femininity? Have pants given way to skirts
—or more properly slacks?

From the masculine point of view, we
are prone to pass it off on the war and
draft. The editor’s chair has long been
sacred masculine property, and to think of
it occupied by a woman is disconcerting.

But what is done, is done, and if the
skirt has taken over where the pants once
reigned, then let it be hers. We know she
is capable of doing the job, Although she
doesn’t officially assume office until Sep—
tember, we wish Catherine Funk,‘ and her
business manager, Geneva Johnson, the best
of luck, ~

O In Recognition of —

Stuart Gerry Brown has been at Grinneil
for almost two years. For the benefit of
those who are not acquainted with him, he
is one of the more talented young faculty
members.

Brown is the author of an anthology of
Amellcan writings dedicated to the ideals
of democracy entitled “We Hold These
Truths". It was in recognition of this work
that he was recently invited to the White
House by Mrs. Roosevelt.

He has also published in collaboration
with a colleague a book of selected poetry
under the title ”Reading Poems.”

His latest creative work appears in the
current issue of The Virginia Quarterly. In
an article entitled ”War and the Humani-
ties", Brown goes to bat in defense of the
core subjects in a liberal arts curriculum.

Using neat and vigorous phraseology, he
defines the position which the “humanities"
deserve in this mechanized world. Incident-
ally, it is a stirring defense of the liberal
arts college such as Grinnell. Read it.

Professors receive recognition rarely. We
are proud to bestow honor where honor is
due.

By Dave Meade

Singing’ Mozart's difficult "Re-
quiem Mass" Sunday aftelmoon,

the Grinnell Oratorio Society gave
one of the best performances in
its history: in fact the best this
critic has heard.

Deserving the highest of lsurels
for its total success is J. Forrest
West. professor of musi, who
conducted superbly.

Tho “Requiem Mass” was Mo-
zart‘s last work. Composing it for
his own death. he died before
completing the piece. and a pupil,
Franz Sussmayer. finished it by
using miscellaneous notes of Mo-
zart’s and by relying upon num-
erous conversations with him.

Although the mass is not mel-
ancholy in tone, as many such
works are, there is a definite ele—
ment of the supernatural through—
out.

Much praise should go to the
beautiful solo quartet work of
Miss Mary Wrany, soprano. Johu
Yourd, boss, Robert Page. tenor.
and Miss Frances Parker, con»
traito. The ensemble of the group
was very good.

Special tribute should also be
paid the Mcompanisis, Miss Sarah
Innes MacDonald. pianist; Elbert
M. Smith, organist; and Warren
J. Wirtz, pianist. They did an
excellent job of creating one score
out of three different versions of
the accompaniment.

APRIL 28. W42

Beautifully sung were the “Lao—
crymosa," “Recordare,” and “Bene-
dictus.” The “Kyrie Eleisonk.” a
double fugue which is very diffi-
Cult to sing. was performed with
fine precision. Tire “Dies Irae”
(Day of Judgment) was impres-
sively sung with full. strong tone
throughout, while the ”Confuta-
tis” displayed very well the men’s
and women's voices separately.

The music of the mass is tre-
mendously difficult to sing, so
much so that only half of the full
membership of the society was
able to sing it. The mass as a
whole was well balanced, and the
appreciative audience surely felt
the power of the great work.
