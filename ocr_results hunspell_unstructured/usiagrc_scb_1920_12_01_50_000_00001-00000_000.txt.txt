made three ‘years ago.~ when it was

Agitation against all forms of cheek
dancing is rife in colleges throughout
the country. and steps are being taken
by committees for varsity and other
dances in colleges in Town to stop the
practice. Dean Nellie S. Aurner, of
the University of low , has recently
.issiied a statement condemning cheekl
ito cheek dancing. and recommending
lthat student committees act to stop
that practice.

Musical comedy and burlesque has‘
also conic in for its call down. both ini
Grinaell and in Iowa City. The orga ‘ ‘
zation of drama centers of the Drama
League is expected to do much to de-
mand that higher class productions be
brought to Grinnell, The Drama
League employs secretaries to investi-
gate all uew plays. and to list good
road shows. These reports are made
public to the members of the league.
with the result that fewer undesir-l
able shows come’ to towns where the

College Sports on Higher
Basis.

(From Iowa state student)

The recent base ball scandal has;
brought those interested in athletics
to realize the hazardous position of‘
college sports at the present time.
Our own coaches have taken a strong
stand against gambling and betting!
on athletic contests. \ ‘

Au Ames coach made the following
statement and asked that it be pubv
llshed:

“Betting on sports has killed horse
racing. is in a fair way to kill pro
fessional baseball. and will kill col-
lege football if it goes on. Collegcl
athletics stand on one leg now as far
as the public is concerned and gam-
bling on games may easily finish
Players who bet are not wanted on
the team. And To like to coach a
team once where the student body

betting."

At the same time. Athletic Director
C_ w. Mayser stated his sentiments
