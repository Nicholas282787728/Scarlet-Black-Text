It's hard to tell when a rehearsal for
the musical play Mugnag begins. As a
warm—up, the six principal actors get
into character by improvising in their
roles as children.The director, crew and
innocent journalists are pulled from
their seats and asked to play a game
involving a beach ball, plastic bat and
trampoline. There is no fanfare when
the play staits, only an announcement
by one ofthe children that they need to
clean up the stage. The toys are gathr
ered up and placed in toy bore» or on
shelves; all ofa sudden the play as be—
gun.

Mi/gliug, described in promotional
materials as a “political play for chilr
dren," was developed in the 1970s by
the Grips Theater Company in West
Germany and carries a ”strong theme
of anti~authoritai‘ianism," said direc-
tor Margo Gray ‘05. While it has been
somewhat updated in a translation by
University of Mrnncsota professor Jack
Zipes, the message to children hasn’t
changed: think for yourself, even when
society tells you not to.

To get that across, Mugnug intros
duces us to Mugnog, who appetus to
be a cardboard box. To young children
Margie and Graham (Madeleine Lee
‘08 and Anna lsrs—Brown ‘08), Mrrgnog
is their escape from the boring reality
of rules imposed upon them by their
parents, their aunt and uncle (Alnﬁn’
da King ‘07 and Cassre Donnelly loo),
and most of all, their aunt and uncle’s
crotchcry downstairs neighbor Mr.
Schmuck (GinaTarullo ‘06). Whenever
the children have a rebellious instinct,
it is attributed to Mugnog. Adults his
lariously overreacr, and soon the police,
mayor and army are all trying to stop
Mugnog.

“Pm me,” said Gray, “the most imr
portant message of Miignog is that ev-
etyont%espccially childreneis bctter

the scarlet and black

Political protest from the mouths of babes

off thinking for themselves and ques~
[letting authority.”

The action of Mugﬂag centers on
Margie, Graham and Mugnog, but
most of the humor and theme comes
from how the adult characters react to
the trio. The adults, including the aunt
and uncle, Mr. schmrrck, the Mayor
(Tarrrllo again), the policeman (Sally
Webster '08) the teacher (King), the
doctor (Donnelly) and the general
(Webster), are the dynamic charac-
tcis in the play. Starting from fear of
Mugnog and the challenge he prescnis,
one by one they come to realize the vale
uc of the childrens rmagrnary frrend.

The manner in which lMl/Ung prcs-

ents its adult characters is also one of
the most interesting parts of the play
One of the musicals songs asks “Why
are all the gl'ownsups afraid of other
grownsups?" and that's perhaps the key
question of the play for older viewers.
All of the adults rvho attempt to sup-
press Mugnog are portrayed as great
bullies, trying to conceal their own his
securities by bossrng children around if
we would all just lighten up and have
some fun, Mirgiwg tells us, the world
would be a better place.

“That's really commentary on how
adults behave in the real world,” said
Tanillo, who plays Mr. Schmuck and
the iVlayor, both characters whose bltis»

Tantalizing Tidbits

- The play has 6 to actors. The guitar player Richard

the 1/2.

to avoid judgment from other adults,

A lot of the message goes over well

Mngnog seems to strike a false note,
usually when the sprrit of the child
characters dominates the mild anti-au-

dependent, but yet another to reject all
rules, even wellrintentioned ones like
children going to bed at decent hours

Anti- -hufﬁng and ogre sequels

Shrek 2 (PG

They’re back and ogrier than ever!

In this animated fairy tale sequel,
ogres Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona
(Cameron Diaz) and their trusty steed
Donkey (Eddie Murray) travel to Far
Far Avmy to visit Fiona’s royal, and hu-
man, parents (John Clecse and Julie
Andrews) who are seeing red at Fiona’s
being green. Fiona’s dad, scheming
with the Fairy Godmother and Prince
Charming, hire a hitman, err, hitcat
Pussrianoots (Antonio Banderas) to
take out Shrek. Of that dry summary,
all you really need to remember is Puss-
inelsoots, since he's the only engaging

(and then Amciimn Wet/ding) were
all just about how Jason Biggs looks
awkward having sex, be it with pies or
girls?

Shed 2 has the same problem. To
quote former 5553 movie reviewer ere
traordinaite Jayn Bailey ‘05, “The mov-
ie’s theme is so icall I mean, how
many times must we be told "beauty
lies within"and that “true love is blind?!"

sides, the movie contradicts itself by “5*

wise sage—this problem plagues Sim/t
2.

Ski-ck 2 is an ideal movie to share
with a Davis Buddy. The animation is
beautiful, and while the good jokes are
rarer than I’d like, they are sprinkled
throughout. The Fairy Godmother is
an intriguingly malevolent avatar of
fate, and Banderas lampoons himself
wonderfully as a rascally Tabby. Ani-
mated frlrns have been amazing over

the past five years, though, and Slim

gem of this golden age.

Citizen Ruth (R)

When it was released, one
of Citizen Ram's taglines was “A Pro—
Laugh Comedy," and, with that in
mind, its probably blindingly obvious
to all of us why its being shown this
weekend. When Ruth, an b'iiih tlant ad-
dict with four children and a fifth on the
waytg cts taken on as the postel‘cliild
for both the lrypocriricrl Babysavcrs
and the overly polished prorchoicers,

a wacky romp through the two mover
inents ensues. The politiclzation of
the personal goes to propagandistl'c EX-
tremes on both sides of the debate, and
Cilizw Rut/J sets out to humorously
skewer each group. But really, when it
comes down to it, this is about as dark
as comedy gets.

But there's another important
theme in this film that the inspiring
promotional photograph of a clean,
grinning Laura Dern posed as the
Statue of Liberty, with a can of spray
paint in her hand, does not reveal. its
hufﬁng. For what feels like the better
part ofthe frlm, Ruth (played by Dem),
has that spray paint in her hand and the
lower half of her face is painted blue,
her eyes are glazed, and she is nothing
like that grinning statue. And maybe,
just maybe, it would be proper at this
time to advance the idea that huffing is
not funny, Really not rarnny. Makes you
want to cry and throw up not funny.

1 know everyonc’s excited about
this “abortion comedy," and it is defr
riitely worth seeing, not to vindicate
your position but to remind yourself
that everyone in the world is crazy or
a jerk, if you think that's funny, And if
you think huffing is funny, more power
to you,
