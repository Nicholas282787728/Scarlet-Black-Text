hall brother”! So runs their constant but
expediency-muffled query. And cautiously
stated though it is, that question merits a
prompt and straight—forward answer. Nor
is that answer difficult to discover.

Consider, first, that long-established cuss
tom has decreed that even tlle most accom-
plished freshman owes a very definite re—
spect to every llpper classmaniowes it be-
cause the latter has been longer associated
with the institution and is usually older,
saner and “far better \equipped through
greater training and experience than is the
incoming prep, fresh from high school and
its attendant juvenilities. Nor is this tradi-
tion peculiar to Grinnell. Wherever there
is a college there is this distinction, a dis—
tinction that has become a foundation stone
of college life,

And buttoning is an outward indication
of this custom.

0 WHY BUTTON?

With the recent apparent increase in Honor

smELIGl-lTs: So Jorgy’s got his
famous and very popular Honor
‘6' pin back again. It's even
money that it’ll be hung within

how does it feel to be one of the
many? . . . Couple congrats to

getting kinda old but we're for it.

It seems that Jack Keelln, the new
president of Rawson, is taking his
job pretty seriously. The boys
from other halls can’t even go

a nice peaceful conversation with

TOWN TALK: After the gals
put over choir “dress day," the
boys were planning a little coun-
Let-action for yesterday. But the
plans fell through, and the dorms
