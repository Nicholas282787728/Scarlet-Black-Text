is the fifth in nine days for the Fio<
nears.

On paper, Allies is supposed to have
the Weakest team in the Valley but
paper wins and loses are of little re-
liability. Ames plays Oklahoma tar
night and this game will give a more
direct comparison of the strength of
the two teams. The Cyclones before
held the Sooners to a three point lead
and it is entirely possible that they
may turn the tables and win their
first Valley game.

The Pioneers looked last night, just
how they fell—«tired. With a few
days rest the score might have been
different and the fact that Allies will
be entirely fresh and that the Sooners
may be somewhat worn out from the
two games they have previously play-
ed. possibly will declfle that game.

Grinnell holds a win over the farm—
ers on their own court and should
have little difficulty in repealing the
performance here. There is no doubt
however that thelr team has improved
and that they are coming up here 10
avenge the former defeat.

(By James A, Work)
Evidencing remarkable rhythm and

fluency in a. miner heavy program,
Dr. G. Herbert Knight, professor of
organ, won the acclaim of a large aud-
lence in his ﬁrst Grinnell rccucl held

in Herrick chapel last Wednesday eve-

ning.

Dr. Knight demonstrated unusual

technique and precision, which, coun

led with his flexibility and sympathy

of interpretation, made his recital an

In the first movement of the

his precision and technique stood out
splendidly. “limout apparent bodily

Great Liberal Challenges New Generation to
Adopt Christian Ideals, and Work for
International Peace.

The success or the 1925 Fellowship
courcrcucc seems to narc been assured
ru advance when Dr. Hurry Emerson
l‘osdick, of Union Theological scnli-
nnry in New York city was secured to
deliver the series of cliapcl lectures
llis ialks bavc aroused a tremendous
wave of enthusiasm among slmlcnfs,
(dainty, iownspcoplc, and delegates to
the conference. VVitll nearly o hun-
died lewd ministers c‘arryinglrls ideals
back with them to their cliurc‘lres, the

conference just ended is expected to '

spread its stimulating influence

throughout the state.

Dr. Fosdlck delivered the third.
Gates Memorial lecture inst Thurs-
day morning on the subject “A Chal-
lenge to the Younger Gsncmlinn." Al-
though this topic was not included in
his regular Iyogi-cm of speeches, Dr.
Fosdick decided that the occasion of
Lincoln's birthday oliered cu cxccllcni
opportunity for introducing this new
subject with reference to national
ideals.

The fcmous lecturer opened his cob;
dress by telling about a sign which the
lspancss Express Company in Tokio‘
had put up to attract the American
tinde, “Entrust your baggage to us,
and we will send it in all d1reclions“l
"i trust that in this change in my pro
gram of speeches i am not sending
your thoughts in all directions. " His
expressed desire was "to come lo clc

There wele two Ways be ex-
piained, of getting at the material in
hand There was the academic way
of treating the subject with all the
long Words at his disposal. and there
was the method which Sam Jones, ,a
very llndignified preacher, was think~'
mg oi when he remarked “\"Vllerl i

from a. giraffe to 8. jackass can get at
Continuing, Fosllick sai , "I have
no desire to cast reflections on the
constituent elements of the audience,
but I will try to put: things on the
ground so that you can get at them.”
“Sm-nil. tile Gm, and Narrow are way”
Mr. Fosdick said that. he believed
that these words of Christ were
among the most important the Master
ever littered, “Enter ye at the strait
for wide is the gate, and broad
i be way, that leadelb to estruc-
lion, and n'iany there he which go in
thel'ea: Because strait is the gate,
cnd narrow is the Way, which leadeth
unto lile‘, and few there be that ﬁnd
it," Choosing this as his text, the
Gates lecturer went on to describe the
various ways of living. First be cold
of the lswlcss, uncontrolled life with
us wayward desires. Then he spoke
of the life exemplified by a friend of
his, a. wonderful singer, for whom
"narrow was the way and strolled-

;cd was the gate." To Fosdick, Jesus is

no ascetic, "He rejoiced in nature:
his whole life radiated liberty and buli—
piness. But narrow was the way and
straight the gate for him, too."
Concerning the young people, the
great easterner said, "If I were to
choose a. single word to describe the
characteristics of the younger genera»
tion,1 would say self-expression. It
is true in the school, in the theater,
and everywhere, The young people
‘are impatient against present stand-
crds. n is well to pause and do lus-
lice to the virtues of this feeling In-
evitably, after the winter season
