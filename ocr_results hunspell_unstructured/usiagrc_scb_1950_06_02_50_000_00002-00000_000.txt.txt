A Failure-~Progress

On the surface it would seem that ouricdlr

to il loin-tom thumping this year. at its climax,
a rather "gnilic‘dnt failure, We attempted

' one major Campaign ‘ d got negative r -

0 inlon concerning the revlvll'lcdtliln of ill: long

defunct Hunur System.

At lirst, we seemed to get results oi the sort
llu‘i would gratiry even the most disillusioned
cdliorialists. A week utter our initial blast. the
strident council’s honor system committee, ap-
pointed in the spring or leis tor tiie purpose or
studying an academic honor system tor Grilmell,
announced that it was proceeding under a lull
head or steam and was soon knocking hard at
the door or the personnel board with a system
tor their approval,

Meanwhile, we hammered out more editorials
aio-cd at garnering student approval tor the pro.
jcci (sec cartoon opposite). Wc loltily described
the pliilosphical intricacies ot the general ques—
tio ot freedom and honesty, expressing the be~
lie that, as has been proven in many smoothly
ope» ing academic honor systems, ireadom and
ho esiy can exist as “chaste bcdicllows." From
ml. casual chuaintances, from thinking Grin-
nc iuiis oi all ages \ve got enthusiastic responr

. s and words ot encouragement. The committee,
. under the guiding hand at scientist Dave Moo.
bc , put in many tedius hours carrying out sug—
gc ed changes. revisions and additions train the
dacaliy and administrative personnel who had
‘ . :n a serious interest in the project.

Finally utter months ot worry and mounds
oi news and editorial copy. a system was work-
ed out meeting the approval ot the taculty and
student committees and the whole question was

In the general working procedure it was de-
ciiird that three iourths oi the student body would
have to vote in invor oi the system in order to
-pass it, For those oi us who worked on the sys-
lcm and at publicising it the voting was nothing
short oi a debacle. With less than the required
number oi positive voters bothering to cast a
ballot, and with those that did voting rather
overwhelmingly negative, the system went down
to the most certain and decisive sort or defeat,

Back in the rust paragraph we stated that
our failure on thi score was a ., gniiicant tail.

purposes isolated student opinion on at 1c

am. After due constderation and a protract-

e cooling ot our tempers, we have come to the

conclusion that the answer to the problem of

; ho to start a successful academic honor sy -
:i too: lies in the concept of a “social" system

that i a tradition of social living, at social "cun-

duct it' you wish. based on the honor principle.

I: it were humanly possible for us, the students

, ot Grinnell, to conduct our college community

Could such a system, a tradition oi social
heharior based on individual integrity and hour
be constructed and extenuated to live as an
integral part or Gi'innell‘?
WE BELIEVE THAT IT COULD, All it
is someone to give it a try. It's happened

Capitalist Again

two or three sheets or clean copy paper into

scorch of truth. . .
What seems to be one or the iavoritc 'eni-lyr
in-the-yenr yarns around tiic campus is the old
story about the bookstore. The students are her
ing gauged: The lat capitalists are milkiog_iis
dry because they know we have to buy books

from them. Did yn' hear that the school made )

$15,000 a” hooks last year? Why don't we revolt
iind institute a student cooperative? How about
giving us the books at cost? .’

Never befur havmg brushed up again .i any
real bloated capitalists, we were naturally‘ deep
lighted las: week when someone suggested an in-
vestigation ot pi-ot'iteerii-ig in the bookstore. The
spccii'ic charge leveled was that the college book
store was selling a particular text at something
like two dollars more than the list price in other
bookstores.

Seeking the proverbial brass tacks to which
th editorial mind is siiposed to get down, we be.
gan our investigation armed with righteous ins
dignation, and a stereotye,,oi‘ a bloated capitalis

ed teeth and thousands oi little dollar signs cleVr
crly woven into the ialiric oi his tailor—modes.

What we iound was Mr. Samuel Wossnn,
manager ot the Grlnnall bookstore, who like
most everybody else around the campus who
isn't a studcnt, is just another employee oi the
college. sin-pr ingly enough he didn't seem at
all upsct when we bodly stated our reason tor
being there, lie did seem a little sad,

“It's the same way around the college the

tii-st part ol' the year." he said philosophically.
“I attended a clinic this summer at the uiiivcrsi1
ty of Chicago tor bookstore managers » . we'vc
till got the same problems." Mr. Wasson, an un-
pretentious gentleman, not the least bit bulbous
and without a trace of a dollar sign on his blue
shirt and gray slacks, assured us that every te. »
book in the store was priced strictly byg publish,
crs' list. "If anyone thinks he's been overcharg—
ed he should come in and see me.” Wassom said,
because it’s purely accidental. You-know how;
t around the first at the years: We agreed
that we knew how it was. “Well," hc'itvent on,
"with all the students milling around trying to
get their books and with a lot of new help .
Well, mistakes are made. As a matter oi tact, we
just about br it even on the book Where we
make any profit is on supplies . , . but even at

We were on our way after thanking Mr.
Wassoln for his cooperation when he . id 3 little
Sadly, "A lot of people think I own the book-
store. I don't.”

On Magazines

e wcrc greatly pleased by the furious afv
tort and enthusiasm ot the inimitable Rocdcr
that culminated with the magazine Blarc '50
containing a goodly shore of the prizerwlnnlng
manusciipts produced by Griiinell writers durmg
the year. The mag, a slick iob troni cover to
cover and now on sale around campus, contains
the sort oi heart warming proof to us that Grill-
nell is not lacking by any means thc sort oi
ci-cative imagination and intelligence that makes
a mag-dune of this sort possible

Although this publication was planned by
Rocder as simply a one shot proposition in order
to iind an outlct to the gen al public tor the
material pickcd by the writing contcst judges
as being supcrlative original sturl, there has been
, owing demand tor a regular outlet oi this
s on the campus, a magazmc to combine the
best leaturcs of the two now detunct publications
Zephyr and Tanager. As reported on page one.
such a magaeinc is shaping up at this moment
and we say “Three Cheersl"

This magazine to be called Arena is the pro-
duct of the creative imaginations of a group of
iSlngularly, iorceiul, energetic young men mo.
tivatcd by a sincere bciicl that there is a burnr
ing neccssity tor a medium through which the
best in Grlnnell’s native expression can be re-
corded - '

We are unequivocally in favor oi thcir pro-
p - d publication Wc honestly tool that it day
serves the attention at all Grinnellians who wish
to sea a Significant addition to the cultural lite
oi the college bloom and llcurisii.

Tradition Broken

the torm of a mythical junior with the aubolrtlr
hatrllame, John Spellman,

Our editorial board. disturbed by the tact that
only threc candidates turncd up as eligible loi-
nomination by virtue cl properly aitixcd peti—
tions, outlined for its mythical dark horse what
it believed to be an idealistic yct thoroughly
workable plaitorm, and ran it along with the

name of its crlndldate in El pure-Election lssuc 01
the S & B. ,

The cditorial board was properlv picascd
during thc no. law days by irate students who
would pop up to announce that it (the board)
had overs cppcd all the bounds ot propriety by
backing its own candidate, that it was gm: y
unlair to the other candidates and besides all
that it was down right unrethl‘ttll Furthermore
it was a departure trom all timerhonored Grim
nall tradition Ior the student body’s own paper
to hack a single 'lndidale and then (llndl
