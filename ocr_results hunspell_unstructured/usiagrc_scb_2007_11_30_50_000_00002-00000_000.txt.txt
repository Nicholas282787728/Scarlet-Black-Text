member of GCCF.

This is the second Poverty Dinner hosted
by GCCF. Last spring, they organized a simi-
lar event to raise money for Kids Against Hun-
ger, although there was no satellite packaging
coinciding. GCCF has begun to focus more on
socialjustice, and started distributing a new so,
cial justice newsletter this semester called “SJ
News," among other things. “I'm really glad
the fellowship [GCCF] is moving in this die
rection," said Brian Smith ’09. another member
of GCCF.

Others in GCCF agree that the group
needs to do more with respect to social justice
issues. “It comes out of feeling within GCCF
that we hadn’t been as involved in doing so
cial justice stuff," said Kiri Aho ’08, a member
of GCCF and another teeorynizer of the
event. “Social justice is all wrapped up in
my faith. it's necessary to work for everyone to
have a good life. This [dinner] is a small way
to start.”

Faculty optimistic about searches

After endeof—year registration challenges, searches for new professors are strong

BY DRAKE BALLEW

Students preparing to register last spring were frustrated to
discover that a large number offaculty leaves, sabbaticals and
retirements left many departments in limbo. “The loss of the
Early European History seminar sent me scrambling,"recalled
Tommy Jamison '09. “I never imagined a dearth of professors
in the subject." Similar problems occurred across departments,
and as a result, Academic Affairs began this semester with a
high priority on filling faculty vacancies.

Currently, the college has 13 tenure-track positions open
to applicants, varying in subject from Medieval English Lir-
erarui-e to Film History and Theory. With the exception of
onchrlie Art department’s search for a painting professorm
every positions application period ends before the new year.
And while, like other schools, Grinncll is not accepted by its
top choices, the faculty is optimistic about current results.

"It's always important to fill any vacancies on the faculty
and we don't generally have trouble," said Jim Swarm, vice
president for Academic Affairs. "There aren't any budget rer
strictions or anything like that, it's just a question of ﬁnding
superb additions to the faculty."

Generally, if the college cannot fill a tenurettrack position
in time, they wtll hile telm piofessors and then cairy ovei the
search the following year. Positions ale usually posted on the

college website. That there was only a single carryover search
coming into this year speaks of the college's recruiting success.

Each department seeking candidates seems to have a strong
grasp of the sort of candidates needed to ﬁll the positions being
left. “we've had an extraordinarily strong pool of applicants
from top graduate programs," said Chair ofFaculry Eliza Wile
lis, Political science. “That’s usually the case but this year has
been particularly strong."

In addition to the strength ofthe applicant pool,wulis said
she is encouraged by the enthusiasm ofthe candidates. “1 have
been really impressed with the candidates that we‘ve been talk-
ing to. how excited they are about Grinnell College," she said.
“They know a lot about [the school] and they seem very, very
interested. People always show interest in a job but I feel that
Grinneil's reputation is growing in a big way.”

This enthusiasm will undoubtedly be reassuring to student
and faculty of departments that have suffeer from sudden faCe
ulry shifts throughout the last several semesters.

For Willisyhowever, renewed interest from professors has
paralleled an increased engagement in the process by students.
“People want to teach good students and I think that our en,
downient, competitive salaries and good benefits are cel‘iVinrr
ing,”Willis said,“but the main thing that helps us are the stile
dents, tilily.”
