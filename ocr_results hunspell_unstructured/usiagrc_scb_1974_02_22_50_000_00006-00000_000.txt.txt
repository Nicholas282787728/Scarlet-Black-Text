Last fall, enrollment was higher
than ever before by three students.
according to James Hamilton, as—
sociate dean of the college divuls
ged, setting the tigure at l26’7 stur
dents. Explaining how the college
arrives at the number oi new stur
dents necessary for the fall, Hams
ilton pointed out‘thal the number
of graduating seniors, transfers or
withdrawals, and new positions made
available by enlarging the college
must be calculated, This year's ad-
missions quota is 4405tudents.0ver
the last four to five years, the Cole
lege has purposely expanded irom
approximately 1150 to 1250 students,
Hamilton announced Also, the gro-
wth in number oi students particle

in setting a quota tor admissions.
This growth of off- campus study has

measured 10 to 30 students in re
cent years, adding anadditional need
for 10 to 30. more students to be
admitted, Hamilton said.

The point has been reached this
year when the planned increase ol “
the college ls complete, Hamilton
advised, so that the number of
graduating seniors will level off
and the admissions quota will level
also A reduction in the need for
new students should occur, lower»
ing the admissions quota enabling
Grinnell to more easily meet the
quota, Hamilton stated Not bells

tor Grinnell, Hamilton guessed that
the study failed to take account
of the variable of Grinnell's high
quality program, "As long as we
have a high quality program, we
can survive the competition,” Ha-
milton insistedt

A decrease in enrollment has oc-
curred this semester due to per-
sonal leaves or absence (47), acad-
emic leaves (31), academic dismis-
sal (14), transfers or withdrawals:
(31), and graduates (28), acknowle-
dged Jim Tederman, dean oi stur
dent affairs. This decrease is not
unusual, Tederman remarked, lor
the spring semester. The new pol—
icy of no academic leave second
semester has reduced the differ-
‘lence between first and second sem-
ester enrollment, Tederman noted.
Policy on personal leaves is new
also, Tederman said, because pre-
viously when a student left, he had
to be readmitted. Now, the policy
allows the student to leave without
reapplying and lf he has financA
ial aid, that is guaranteed upon his
return, whereas it wasn’t under the
old policy

Personal leaves are being exer-
cised by students, Tederman com-
mented, in order to get a break
and a_dillerent environment. Many
think, they are wasting time and
money because they are not sure
of what they want to do. pressure
towards academic excellence for-
ces some to take leave, Tederman
maintained.

Most often, transfers or withdras
wals are seeking a different pro
gram than available at Grinnell or
are disenchanted with college in

plained. Financial reasons ,otten
send students to state schools, Tedr
erman added.
