Lynn Sampson and Verne Robin—

forwards with Joe Woodward, an

Coiuvill May Start

Bill Conwill, a junior college
graduate, who has been playing
both guard and forward in a
creditable manner will probably
get one back-court assignment.
Just who will play the other
guard is probably as much a
mystery to Truesdale as it is to
us, Jim Wallaoc, Jim Blnyney.
Howard True, or Harry High are
among the possibilities.

Not much is known about the
Coe team. Ben Kammer, a high
scoring center, and Bob McKinley,
a veteran forward compose the
nucleus of the team, but the Koe
hawks are likely to be as short
on reserves as the Pioneers

The Kohawks defeated Central
last night by a margin of 32 to

Cyclones Beat Pioneers
by 39-26 Score

By Wells Barnett

The Cyclones from Iowa state
college last night displayed a poWA
erful defense and a ragged but efr
fective offense to defeat Grinnell
at Ames by a 39726 score, The
game was a rough, tough scram-
ble, the two terms being charged
with 25 fouls, and two Iowa state
players, Flemming and Blahnik.

Flemming High Scorer

Flemming, with 15 points, led
the scoring for both teams. but
the real star of the Iowa state
team was a diminutive guard,‘
Johnson, who sparked the Cyclone
defense all evening, The little
blond scored only four points, but
managed to make himself a stand~
out with his excellent floor work
and guarding. Thompson, SIX-foot,
fiverlnch center, was effective in
controlling rebounds and the tip.

Individually. all of the five men
who started the’ game for Grin-
iiell—LaMasney, Berry, Hayward,
Fowler, and Deaniplayed good
basketball. The trouble was in]
lack of unity and organization.
LaMasney played his usual brilr
liant floor game and tied for scoi»
ing honors with six points, while
Hayward turned in a good, fast,
aggressive game. Berry handled
two positions, center and guard,
and acquitted himself admirably
against Thompson's terrific advan-
tage in height, while Dean and
Fowler both played good defensive
ball, and were effective on the ofr
fense, both getting six points to tie
for high point honors.

Lady Luck, the fickle dame who
failed to icspond to the wooings of
prof Guy Loohabaugh and Capt,
Blll Fowler this fall, seems to be
turning a deaf ear to thc equally
ardent pleas of basketball prof,
Johnny Triicsdale and his co-cap-
taiiis, Jimmy Lalviasney and Hal
Dean

Both the grinders and the
t-ngers started the season with
better than average prospects
for Grimlcll teams. Both
sipiads found themselves in the
dog- house ,ivith Lady Luck
shortl after the season got
under n-ay. And strangely
enough, both squads Iclt most
keenly the loss of the same
man. The some man happens
to be Frcd “Junior” Luther.

Dame Fortune is just about the
only lady that Junior has failed to
win, and just what's wrong with
his technique in this came escapes
the analytical powers of this hum-
ble person. It may be that it
isn’t luck at all, but merely that
Fred failed to drink a lot of milk
in his youth. and that his bones
don’t have that nice high calcium
content that they should have.

x s a

.\t any rate, tivo regrettable
mishaps to Luther have kept
the sophomore athlete from
whining two major letters,
and have further depriied him
of an opportunity to become
the first nine letter man at

Grinncll since the miys of Fred

Winters.

Big Joe Woodward, who spends
a lot of time playing football and
basketball in the fall and winter,
has agitated mightily among the
athletic brethren of Grinnell col—
lege in behalf of a baseball team.
His arguments, which are for the
most part sound, have failed to
elicit any favorable response from
the fathers of Grinnell athletics,
and Prof. Truesdale, in looking
over the financial statement of the
football season, and scratching his
slightly gray head meanwhile, was

 

heard to remark that there would
