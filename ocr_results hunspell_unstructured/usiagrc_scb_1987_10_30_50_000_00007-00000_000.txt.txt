My Way

in any event, i
think Grinnell looks more dignined
scarlet and black. We at least look
like we are serious about playing
toothall, unlike trying to look like a
chicken ilying all over the lield.
The Kohawks deserve to have their
wings clipped or could at least get
captured by Colonel Sanders

Coe is one or the few schools (at
least that l have seem that actuah

»ly has an oiiicial cheerleading
squad. 0t course, the seven or
eight blondes on the opposite side
ot the iield could barely be heard.
That's no great loss tor us, I guess,
From what the Grinncll side did
hear, the cheers weren't very com.
plex, but then that’s Coe. what else
can one expect? 1 did overhear so-
meone in the Grinnell bleachers
asking someone else how long it
took the cheerleaders to learn

Continued from Page 8

Cne has a core curriculum that re
quires all females to enroll in
Cheerleading 101. I wonder it
anybody at Grinnell would be in-
terested?

Even though the final score
wasn’t what Grinnell fans had
hoped for it was at least fun Then
again, any Grinnell Coe match- -up
is bound to be exciting

Think there’s no
place in business

for Someone
with a liberal
arts degree?

Think again.

Coe Kohawks — ramous tor
their creativity, Coe College in
geniously combined their school
name with an abbreviated torm oi
the Hawkeyes, in the last 20 years.
wologists have discovered that a
Kohawk animal does exist. In»
digenous to swamps and marshes,
the Kohawk is a cross between a
turkey and a dodo bird, similar to
most students at Coe.

Knox siwash 7 The Dictionary
or American Slang detines a
siwash as a mean, savage lndian.
Any Indian would be mean and
savage it he or she were iorced to

St, Norbert Green Knights — Us-
ed to be called the Green Homes,
Playbooks had to be deciphered
With a secret decoder ring. In1952,
DC. Comics sued st. Norbert and
torced the nickname to be changed
to Green Knights

lllinois College Blue Boys 7 The
only school in the country to be
nicknamed aiter a nursery rhyme,
Little Boy Blue, come blow your
horn/The sheep's in the meadow,
the cow's in the corn, The basket-
ball team was originally nicknam.
ed the Three Blind Mice, until Lit.
tle Jack Homer and 01d King Cole
joined the team.

It is uniortunate that the
Midwest Conierence is too small a
conterence to have national
coverage or their sporting events i
would love to see Brent Musbnrger
say that the Pioneers barbecued
the Kohawks, the siwash
whitewashed the Blue Boys, and
the Green Knights outdueled the
Fighting Scots, with a straight
face.
