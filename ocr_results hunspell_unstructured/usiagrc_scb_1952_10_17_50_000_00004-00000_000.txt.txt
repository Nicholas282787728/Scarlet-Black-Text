For the fourth straight time,
Grinnell‘s Pioneers dropped a
close contest to a Midwest loop
rival, and for the second week
in a row they saw a half time
margin be turned into a defeat;

Grinnell jumped into an
early lead before a large
, Parents Day crowd, with two
2 second quarter touchdowns
. after a scoreless first period.
John McCllntnck scored the
first with :- 22»yard run that
capped a Scarlet drive and
Gibby Vartan tallied the next
when he collared a St. Olaf
pass and dashed 27 yards to
score.

Clint Sathrum’s daeyard pass
to John Gustafson put the olies
on the Grinnell four and the
same combination clicked for the
score late in the first half. After
intermission the Pioneers' of-
fense bogged down and the two
st. Olaf scores sealed the ver-
dict.

Coach John Plitsch was
pleased with the play ,of the
Grinnell linemen. especially
defensive tackles John DIIlIlnp
and John Thoma. Both the
passing attack and defense, the
two glaring weaknesses in last
week's game have been re-
ceiving attention in this
week's drill sessions.

Wins Praise 3

by lton Staugcr

One of the busiest men on
the Grinnell campus is Dave
Stumbaugh.‘ His schedule would
undoubtedly be the death of a
less determined student. For not
only is he the Pioneers' only‘
triple-sport letterman, but has
been named high on the Dean's
list for the past three years.

In addition, Sturnhaugh was
elected president of Clark, and
boosted to a coveted spot in
Friars. Besides this, he spends
a couple of hours a day wait»
lng tables at Cowles.

A native lownn, this 6 it.
2 in, athletic looking gentle-
man came to Grinnell via
Clinton. Here he prepped at
Lyons high, winning a total
of seven letters in football,
basketball, and track, and
became president of the let-
tennen‘s club there. stum-
baugh studied hard, too, and
graduated third in his class.

,On the Pioneer gridiron he
holds down the offensive left
end spot in the line of this
year’s stalwart Squad. He has
played under three different
systems at Grinnell, but re-
marked, “This year’s team is,
the best overall squad i've play—i
ed on. The spirit and morale are
the best I’ve seen at Grinnelli"
Stumbaugh played single andi
double wing last season, and
another variation of the T inl
his sophomore year.

Much of his interest and
prowess in athletics stemmed
from his father who played
prep school and sami»p!‘o ball
for many seasons: It was he
who started Stumbaugh sports-l
wise.

stumbaugh, an economics
major, hopes tn become a law-
yer someday, and plans to go l
to graduate School next fall, I
“if I stay Z-s nftei' June

Even his summer work is con-‘
nected with sports. He has been
supervisor and recreational di-
rector of one of Clinton's play-,
grounds.

Coach John Pfitsch, Stum»
baugh’s basketball mentor for;
two years and head of this seas;
son’s football battalions, praisesi
him as a performer. “Dave is all
good man to have on the squad,”
Pfitsch said. “He’s eager to
learn and correct his faults—a
perfectionist by nature. lie
strives for the top in every-
thing he does, and that’s an,
admirable goal," i

I agreed.

Champion Gates headed onei
= step nearer to its second straight

intramural football crown last
Monday by rolling over an outs
manned Langan squad, 26-0. It
was the third straight triumph
in the current season for the
Tower Rats, who have now
scored an average of 80 points
per game, while holding their
opponents scoreless.

At the other end of the
league standings, Clark men
had something to cheer about
too, as their cellar club finally
scored its first TD of the cams
paign. Clark lost to Cowles.
however, by the count of 25 to
6. Also this week Clark was
edged out by South Younker
6-0. as the Rebels moved into
fourth place.

South Younker won 3, sees
and game this week, outsccrs
ing Dibble 13 to 7, while the
Yankee neighbors jumped from
fourth to third in the rankings
with a 1577 triumph over
Smith,

Smith. second in the league
one week ago, dropped another
game to Cowles, 6~2. and sank
to sixth spot.

Two games were played this
afternoon in league competi-
tion, Gates was a heavy favor-
ite to whip south Younker, and
runnersup Rawson was picked
to top Smith.

Rawson fought its way to
second place a week ago by
blanking Cowles 7 to o and
edging out a favored north
Younker team 7-6 on a last
minute touchdown drive. only
a 7.7 deadlock with the Rebels
is keeping the Kelley men out
of a first place tie with Gates.

in other games a week ago
Dibble mashed Langan 2M,
Gates beat Dibble 25 to 0,
Smith blanked South 74), and
Langan won its only game of

-the year over last place Clark,

6-0.

i
Next week's games will not,

have anyiof the top contenders
for the title meeting each other.
instead, most of the better
teams will be facing the bot—
tom end of the league and
should widen the gap between

the first and last divisions.

statistics of games played to
date are quite interesting. in
16 games so far, the Winners
have accumulated a total of
214 points, while the losers
have mustered only 23. Ten 02
those games have been shut
outs, including one scoreless tie,

Meanwhile the intramural
tennis tournament has been
progressing slowly. According to
Bill Rex, intramural chairman,
first round matches must be
played by Sunday evening of
this week, and the results turn-
ed in to John Truesdale (phys»
ical education) or himself by
a pm. 0th wise the matches
will be decided by a flip of a
coin.

Next week’s football sched-
1ule: Monday; North vs. Clarki
Dibble vs. Cowles; Wednesday:
Langan vs. South, Rawson vs.
Clark; Friday: Gates vs. Cowles;
,North vs. Dibble,

Harriers +0 Race
Sco’rs: Drake Se+s
Mark in First Win

Grinnell's once victorious har-
riers traveled to Monmouth,
ill., to face the Monmouth Scots
at 4 p.m. this afternoon.

Coach EG Booth’s speedsters
opened the 1952 season last
Saturday by edging St. Olaf
26730. Litle Dave Qutub turned
in a good race to win first
place for the Pioneers, out
freshman George Drake stole
the show. The LaGrange, ill.
frosh unofficially broke the
Grinnell course record by two
seconds, racing the three miles
in 16:04.1.

The Scarlet and Black trav-
eling team to Monmoutn‘can-
sisted of Qutuh, Ken Wright,
Bari-y Lawrence, Jim Thomp-
son, and Ed Hamlet.

Last season the Scots only
loss was to Grinnell. Monmouth
gave signs of weakness by
dropping their 1952 opening
dual meet to Cornell Oct. 4.
