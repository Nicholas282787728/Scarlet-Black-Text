Car Workshops, Self-Defense
Classes Planned by FEARLESS

By Riva Sharples

m
S maintenance workshops are

a few of the events planned
by FEARLESS this semester. Orr
ganized last year in the wake of
Tammy Zywicki's murder to
”eliminate gender-based crime
and improve highway safety,”
FEARLESS is continuing to work
on various projects at both local
and national levels.

“This year, we are divided into
three committees: communication,
legislation, and education," ex-
plained group founder Nyashzl
Spears. “Each group is working on
a different project. The communi-
cation committee is figuring outthe
statusofothcrgroupsandiscommu-
nicating with them. The legislation
committee is contacting represenlar
tives frotn both the local and na-
tional legislature and is talking with
them and is trying to set up the
callboxcs. The education commit-
tee is working on trying to get out in
the schools and on educating adults
aswellaschildrenaboutwhalFEAR»
LESS is about."

In fact, the organization is so
busy this year that alumnus Portia

Sabin, who graduated last May, re
turned to Grinnell this Fall in order
to run the affairs of FEARLESS.

“Basically, I had ajob offer in
Seattle, and I went out there, but I
didn‘tlikcit,”shcsaid. “Soitscemed
like the right decision to come back
to Grinnell. FEARLESS is some-
thing I really believe in and running
it really is a full time position."

Spears agrees.

“IfI had to run FEARLESS and
take a full load of classes, it would
be impossible and I‘d never be able
to accomplish what Portia has," she
said. "That’s why we're in the pro-
cess of becoming nonprofit.”

The organization finished ap»
plying fornon-proﬁtstatuslastweek.
and hopes to be approved and offi—
cial by next semester.

“The process (of being up
proved) takes about six months,"
said Sabin. “Being nonprofit will
enable us to apply for all kinds of
grants. What we hopeto do is set up
a director’s stipend so that someone
like me can run the organization and
getpaid for doing it. Butuntil then,
I have another job so I can support
myself."

Aside from planning car main-
tenance workshops and self defense

clussestARLESS is also working
on producing a promotional video.
The video deals mainly with gender»
based violence, according to Sabin.

“There are several college stue
dents working on it,“ she said. “It’s
going to shortisomelhing thatcan
be sent out to other groups who are
interested in setting up a group like
FEARLESS."

The organization also recently
published iLs first newsletter. And
last year, the group produced high
way emergency information pam»
phlets, which were distributed to all
students on campus.

“We still get between three and
thirty letters a day asking for our
guidetohandlingemergencies,"said
Spears. “All ofthe new students got
them in their orientation packets.
We’re really getting a good response
to it.“

Sabin and Spcars hope that
FEARLESS and its impact on stu»
dents and community will not be
limited tojustGrinnellCollcge. Both
are working hard to prevent the
group‘s isolation.

”We want FEARLESS to be
strongly associatedwith thecollege,"
said Spears, “But we also want the
