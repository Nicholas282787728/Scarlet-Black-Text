Paranoiac Henry

Follows Delusion
For 20 Years

Henry N, written by Luigi
Flrandello, a contemporary Italr
ian dramatist, is the tragedy of
a 20th century paranolac who
masqiieraded for 20 years as a
kin: of llth century Germany.
The play will be repeated cos
night and tomorrow at 3:30 p,m.

Henry’s friends, deciding to
humor his delusion, and to join
the masquerade, also donned
11th century dress and manner»
isms. The contrast between the
medieval and contemporary cos—
tumcs 'is accentuated when both
appear on the stage at the same
time. Except for small details
of makeup, the characterizations
are more than adequate.

Fred Sauers, Clark sophoc
more, presents a convincing per-
formance as the make-believe
in o n a r c h, Charles Dickens,
Dibble junior, playing Baron
Belcredi, the villain of the
piece, also gives an outstanding
performance. Prominent in the
supporting cast is Lois Reimann,
Read iunior, who plays the
part of Donna Matilda, Henry’s
pro—paranoia flame.

The llth century costumes
and the settings were designed
by Marhte Egan. Cleveland sen-
ior, and were constructed in the
college drama workshops, Por—
traits of Wanda Riemann and
David Flood were painted by
Mrs. Van Andrews.

Mr. Kent Andrews (drama)
directed “Henry IV" and Ver-
non Voyles acted as student di-
rector. John MacEachron is the
stage manager.

Dearborn Asser’rs
Too Many People

Don'+ Think Muchi

“We have, in college, to learn
to make a living and learn to
make a life," said Dean Dear-
born, in his Thursday morning
chapel talk. Speaking on the
subject, "Disciplines of Free-
dom," Dean nearborn stressed
the duties and responsibilities of
thinking people.

Pointing out that thinking has
not kept pace with the increase
in literacy and the increase in
the number of books, Dean
Dearborn asserted that there
are too many people who are
not doing very much thinking.
He expressed the hope that
Grinnell students will leave
with an open and independent
mind and be able to add some.
thing original to man’s thinking.

“It will be some time before
those who are willing to work
wiu not have the opportunity to
work,” Dean Dearborn predict.

Campus Search Reveals

Grinnell's l-lidd

By ChuekrWilliama

Hidden in some of the build
teresting
about.

en Facl's

ings on our campus are many in~

things that few of the students have ever seen or known
This reporter went in search of the little known facts and

uncovered an amazing amount of information.

All the math and physics stu-
dents have seen the '33 Pontiac
that sits in the first floor hall-
way of Goodnow, but how many
of them have ever seen the com-
plete Aeronca airplane frame in
the basement? Fewer still know
of the telescope in the tower of
the same building where as-
tronomy classes once were
taught. And how about the
small physics museum on the
second ﬂoor?

Botany Replaces Recreation .

Several campus buildings have
changed hands during the years.
The music building with its full
sized organ, was once the chap-
el. The “I” shaped “Y” building,
one time a recreation center,
switched to science when the

botany department was partly
lcrowded out of Blair. Magoun
hall was once all class rooms;
the administration offices moved
in when crowded out of the li-
brary by 120,000 books.

0n the third floor of Blair
hall is a biology museum with
Iemphasis on the species of in—
sects. This museum was the first
of its kind in the state oi Iowa.
and was in its day one of the
finest in existence.

Just in passing, the original
women’s gym once stood at the
site of the Union building, until
the boys from Rawson overdid
their Halloween fun and burned

it down.

Palm Sunday

Herrick chapel will be opened
and rededicated, and its new or—
gan dedicated Palm Sunday,
Apr. 10. Having undergone ex.
tensive redecoration, including
the addition of new basement
rooms, the chapel will wear a
“new look" for Palm Sunday
church-goers.

That new look has been in
the making since June, 1948,
when the outside work of re-
roofing. ﬂashing, tuckpointing,
and sidewalk expansion began.
ince then, the work has includ-

d replacing radiator heating.

with a new hot air system, re-
pitching the nave floor and lay.
ing new oak flooring, rebuilding
the chancel, and replacing the
old individual seating with
new. made—to.order pews.

Bronze chandeliers, and rheo-
stat controlled lighting will in-
uminate evening services.
Painting has been done to carry
out the motif of antique sol.
idity. The red quarry tile in the
anteAchapel will be set off by a
velvet runner extending to the
altar, behind which the reredos
will stand.

The new organ, whose man-
ual is now being wired, has
a keyboards and 3,542 pipes,
61 steel bars on the harp and
celeste, and 25 tubular chimes.

The basement has been dug
out to install rest rooms, a
dressing room. and storage
space; music racks and cloak
closets have been built, as well
as a tunnel connecting both
areas. A stairway in the front
of the basement will permit the
choir to enter and leave serr
vices from the anterchapel.

occurred while the presidential
candidates were making five.
minute speeches, during their last
appearance before the conven-
tion Saturday.

Roeder, the last candidate to
appear, was carried in after a
two or three minute wait, dur-
ing which everyone speculated
eagerly on his mode of arrival.
After squirming free, with some
difficulty, he presented himself
to the overflow crowd dressed

’ in a white tee shirt, red trunks,

red flannel "bottoms," and heavy
white socks, A sign said, “lt‘s
in the bag!"

Campaign For An Idea

Rubbing his head. where he
was dropped on the way in, he
threatened to get new‘ Cam—
paign managers. Then, "Not hav-
ing made a speech so far," Stu
apologized, “I hate to spoil my
record. But I want to thank the
candidates who said that we
were all capable of handling the
job.” Emphasizing the fact that
he was campaigning for an idea,
not just an office. he told the
crowd that he favored a qualifi-
cation examination in laughing.

Although Rceder's speech
sounded very much like a with-
drawal, he said afterward that
he is still in the running.

He climarcd his appearance
by demonstrating one of his pub-
licity picture poses in order to
prove that it was not faked. Ly-
ing with his back onthe stage,
Roeder crossed his ankles be-
kind his neck and stuck his arms
in the air.

Miss Fan-ell
rell has sung on the air many
times since then, and has for
several years sung on her own
program. Her first extended
coiicci-t tour was in the 194743
season.

Berkley, “I returned to this
campus a veteran—of 63 days in
the U. S. Naval academy, 43 of
which were spent in the hos-
pital. I was discharged with
ideopathic thrombocitapenis pur-
jsul‘a hemorrhagica, a disease
from which normally only young
and delicate females suffer, and
which ordinarily kills vrithln
the first twenty-four hows. Hav-
ing spent most of my twenty-
four hours during the past six-
teen months, I will be brief."

During his speech, Barkley
emphasized the need for I lead-
ership training program here at
Grinnell college. “Everyone pres-
ent is «potential leader,” he said.
“Such a program would an
air in building good govern-
ment, and government would
cease to be a seasonal affair."

“Want That Job”

Bill Pudvan was an especial-
ly active speaker. During his
speech, he emphasized his de-
sire for the presidential position
by jumping from the stage into
the left aisle, waving his forefing-
er like a dueling foil and shout-
ing “1 want that job!” No one
argued. Pudvan asserted that the
president must direct the Ship
dent Council. In addition, he
spoke in favor of greater social
compactness, For further infor-
mation concerning his intentions,
Pudvan referred the Students to
his platform, which he described
as "having met the issues square-
1y.”

”More Power for Council"

Beth Weiss acknowledged that
it was customary to tell an audi-
ence jokes in order to put them
at ease. “Now i wish one of
you wouldtell me one," she said
quickly. A few minutes later
she inspired a groan from the
rear of the theater when she be-
came temporarily flustered and

-forgot one of her major points.

She advocated a more powerful
Student Council, and a different
and more varied social program.
