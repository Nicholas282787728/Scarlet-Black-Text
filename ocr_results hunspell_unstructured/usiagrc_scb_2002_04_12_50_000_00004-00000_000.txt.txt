Messing around Alternative adventures in the arctic

There is a story in Taos, NM. that if you look at the mountains,
they pull you in and you never leave. Stepping out of the Methodist
Church they stayed in, the Taos alternative break group looked di-
rectly upon these mountains.

Although they returned from Taos, the group was strongly effected
by their trip. "I can't imagine a better break," said participant Laura
Welp '02.

“This was the most fantastic group of people that you could possi-
bly have on a trip,” participant Daniel Follmer '05 said.

The group spent their first week with the Tewa tribe on the Taos
Pueblo. They repaired a burned house for an elderly woman who lived
alone.

The process involved re-plastering the walls and floors with adobe,
a mix of dirt, straw, and water. They also Cleaned up ashes and (leaned
the ceiling and the furniture. Group leader Amy Driben ’OA described
the process as ”really fun and really messy."

The group learned manythings about the tribe and the New Mexico
culture from their supervisor, Benito Concha. ”He had so many sto-
n'es," said Follmer.

”I felt honored that we
were allowed to come into this
society that was so traditional
and so Strict with its customs

.. and shown these tradi~
tions," Follmer said.

"We were helping them,
but at the same time they were
exposing us to a certain [cul-
ture],” said Welp.

The group worked hard, but
experienced some frustration
in accomplishing their task. "We weren’t nearly as efﬁcient as those
who had been there longer," Welp said. ”I think that we sometimes
felt that if Benito was just doing it by himself, he would have accom-
plished more. It was frustrating to realize that there were a lot of
things that we didn't do that Well."

When they ﬁnished the house, Benitotold the group that the woman
who lived in the house would be very happy with their work. He told
them that one day the woman would realize how much effort people
put into her house and bless them, group leader Puran Pursani 'UA
said. On that day, Benito said, all the members of the group would
feel very happy and energetic.

During the second week, the group worked at a girls home that
provided residential treatment to girls from ages 12 to is, They re-
paired a running track that the girls walked on for anger management
and went on a hike with the girls, sharing ston'es about their lives and
hearing those of the girls.

highlights of the trip, according to the group, included learning
about the culture of New Mexico and meeting interesting people. "It
was a really good experience because we come from such different
backgrounds," said rollmer. ”It was really good for them to talk to
people who were in college We had a lot of fun talking together."

On the ﬁrst day ofspring break, it snowed three feetin Anchorage,
Alaska, setting a 24shour record. Alt. break leader Bea Menendez ’04
ﬁrst considered leading a trip to Alaska after heanng about the sum-
mer co-leader Lindsay White be spent working there. Though their
original plan of volunteering for a native women’s health system fell
through, Menendez and White were able to arrange work at a vanety
of nonprofit: in the Anchorage area. "All the non-profits were af-
fected a lot by Sept. 11, because funds went
there instead. They had to lay off a lot of
people, including those who would have cos
ordinated [volunteers]," White said.

”The day before we left, we didn’t really
know what we were doing. We just took off
for Alaska; but we met amazing people, and
everything just worked out," white said.

During spring break, students served
breakfast at the soup kitchen Bean’s Café,
worked at the st. Francis food pantry and
clothing distribution center and encouraged
businessestostarta Green Starrecycling pro
gram. At Prairie Homes, a statesrun retire
ment home, students ballroolnsdanted and played bingo and board
games with residents and helped staff members with tasks such as
feeding residents. "We made a lot of in'ends," Menendez said.

White recalled "one of the most shocking" moments of the trip,
when she was working in the dementia unit and saw a man lying on
the floor, straining and pulling at something invisible to others. The
staff explained that the man had been a ﬁsherman all his life, and he

believed he was still pulling in his ﬁshing ropes from the sea.

At Out North Theatre, alt-breakers called Alaskans and tried to
persuade them to share their views in a ﬁlm about same-sex couples.
The Theatre drew their names from people who had posted comments
on the web when gay marriage was banned in Alaska several years
ago. Menendez said that it was especiallychallenging talking to people
who had posted inflammatory or offensive comments.

Because of the snow, busses were often
delayed. Sometimes the group even resorted
to hitthhiking, a common Alaskan practice,
"We learned so much more about the people
and their culture than [we did] just working
at nonprofits,” said White. Though the snow
often made transportation difficult, it also pro-
vided recreation. The group played in the snow
and body sledded.

Every evening the group met to discuss
their experiences during the day and cook ”a
really good meal." They had a very limited
food budget and few tools, so they often res
sorted to inventive cooking techniques: for
example, they made their own hummus by grinding up chick peas with
their ringers.

Both Menendez and White expressed the desire to return to Alaska.
”It’s the most beautiful place I've ever, ever been," said White.

Kids, not Mardi Gras, in New Orleans

Many college students go to New Orleans to wear beads and party.
Denny Marsh '01. and Louisa Warren '04 and their alt. break group went
there to roll up their sleeves and help out at a multitude of organiza
tions.

The group spent the ﬁrstweek in New Orleans
working with four separate organizations.

They conducted housing surveys for the New
Orleans Neighborhood Development Collaboration,
ranking houses in the Central City neighborhood
as good, fair or poor. The organization planned
to use this information to apply for a giant to
improve housing.

They also spent time with residents at Project
Lazarus, an organization which provides pn'mary
(are to people wrth AIDS and HIV.

Finally, they went along on ﬁeld trips around
the city of New Orleans with students at a Charter
middle school and worked at a food bank,

The group spent the next weektwo and a half hours outside of New
Orleans in Clinton, La., a rural area. They stayed at a Boy Scout camp
and worked with TwentysFiist Century Learning, an afterssthool pro
gram, at four public schools.

becausethe schools had no art or music programs, the group worked
on arts and crafts, cooking, and music with the kids. The program is
designed to ”introduce kids to selfrexpresslon," Marsh said.

“It's difficult to judge how faryour efforts will go," Marsh said, but
she said the group felt the trip was successful
and experienced a "sense of accomplishment"
with the kids.

In New Orleans, the group spenttheir free time
exploring the city, visiting the french Quarter,
”exploring the jazz culture,” and attending the
St. Patnck’s Day parade, Marsh said.

In Clinton, free time was spent outdoors at
c the camp. The group held camp fires and went
swimming.

Marsh said the group’s biggest problem was
coming to consensus and that there were many
discussions aboutwhat each member of the group
wanted. There was some conflict, she said, but they "got past it."

The group also experienced being a racial minority in New
Orleans, Marsh said. ”We based a lot of discussion around dealing
with racism within ourselves and in the City," Marsh said. Marsh
called the trip an "eyesopening experience." iJen Woo/r

Building community

After working at P-Patch Community Gardens during Alternative
Summer, Nick Lencioni '02 wanted to bring more Grinnellians to the
program. Lencioni and Katie Hantk 'oz organized an altbreak that in
cluded volunteering at FsPatth and other organizations.

Watch Community Gardens cultivates community gardens in low
income Seattle neighborhoods. Grinnell students worked in areas where
most residents were southeast Asian immigrants. "Many of the resis
dents were farming formerly, and the gardens are helping them transi
tlon to living in the states,"
said Lencioni.

Dunngtheﬁrstweek,stue Seattle, Wash.
dents built gardens and a
shed. "We moved a lot of
dirt,H said Hanck. ”It was not
so much moving the dirtthat
was satisfying, but we made
a bucket bn'gade. It was re-
ally fun working together. It
brought us together, and we
Could see the progress we’d
made.”

The leaders also reported the satisfaction of seeing the gardens
being used. On Saturday, immediately aftertheyfinished working, reSls
dents came out of their homes and began planting peas.

During the second week altrbreakers volunteered in the Parks De-
partment during the morning, completing tasks such as getting rid of
invasive plants and salvaging plants from the site of a future housing
complex. In the afternoons, the group split to help out at recreational
centers with after-school kids programs.

Both leaders enjoyed the ”good group dynamics,“ as well as their
working environment. Lencioni, who plans onjoining Americolps, may
work in Seattle after graduation. ”I'm definitely in love with Seattle,”
said Hanck.
