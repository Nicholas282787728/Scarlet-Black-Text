Prof. Gaub

‘indulges’ in Brahms series

Sunday’s recital features piano, horn, violin, and clarinet

Bv JUSTIN GLANVILLE

Of all the composers who have
been active within the past century,
perhaps none has fit so tidily into
the art music canon as Johannes
Brahms. Notorious for his habit
of endless revision. Brahms's
works display a level ofconservar
tive polish and finesse that sets him
apart frnin such comparatively
reckless contemporaries as
Mussorgsky, Wagner, and Liszt.

Brahms's death 100 years ago
(on April 3, 1897) is being com-
memorated on campus in a series
of four faculty recitals, organized
by Assistant Professor of Music
and pianist Eugene Gaub. which
will cover all of the composer's
duo sonatzs and piano trios. This
Sunday, Mr. Gaub will jotn his
wife Nancy McFarland Gaub (vio-
lin), Jocelyn Langworthy (Clarinet)
and Jennifer Sholiis (French horn)
in presenting the second recital of
the series.

“An alerrahms series has been
a-dream ofmlne for over 20 years."
Mr. Gaub said. “And since 1997
is the 100th anniversary of his
death, it just seemed like a good
opportunity to put it all together.”

Mr. Gaub spent approximately
a year finding musicians for the
pieces and organizing the program,
Though most ofihe performers are
linked with Grinnell in some way,

Ms. Sholtls rind Jonas Tauber
(cello) were imported from other
parts of the state. Each musician
wtll play in at least two oflhc tee
citals, with the exception of Ms
Sholtis, who will play only in the
Horn Trio this Sunday.

Because most of the musicians
involved are not based in Grinnell,
frequcnt rehearsal has been unfear
sible. with each piece typically be
ing rehearsed “two or three times"
beforeiis final performance. How
ever, Mr. Gaub sees this, if any
thing, as a catalyst for spontane-
ity. “These pieces are not over-re—
hearsed," he said. ”or course, I
hope they're not underrrehearsed,
either.”

The series has been more
highly-publicized than most musi-
cal events on the Grinncll College
campus. Mr. Gaub worked with
the Public Relations Office in prep
dueing a brochure about the con-
certs for offrcampus distribution,

“It would be great to fill
Herrick," he said. “but I know
we‘re not the Kronos Quartet,”

Sunday’s recital in Herrick
Chapel—the “most accessible“ of
the series, according to Gaub—
will feature three ofBrahms‘ bests
known chamber works, including
the “Horn Trio.” 0p, 40, for piano,
violin, and horn. Brahms, in his
original orchestration ofthis piece,
called for a ‘natural’ or valveless
horn, but for practical reasons most

modern performances of the work
substitute the valved French horn,

The work is fullofhuniing calls
and energetic rhythms in its outer
movements. In contrast, the slow
movement is generally considered
one of Brahms' most tragic. have
ing been written shortly after the
death ol'thc composer‘s mother. In
this movement. Brahms used the
traditional "horn call" chord pro
gression, a frequent motif in the
rest ofthe work, in a manner which
had first been suggested by
Beethoven in his ‘Les Adicux‘
(‘Farewell’) piano sonata.

“Beethoven gave the horn call
that extra meaning of goodbye,"
said Mr. Gaub. In the slow move-
ment of the Horn Trio, “Brahms
throws it in very subtly and very
brieﬂy. And that‘s the goodbye to
his mother.”

The other two pieces are much
later works. both written near the
end of Brahms's life. Mr. Gaub
singles out the final movement of
the Violin Sonata (Op. 108) as a
personal favorite. “It‘s a lot of
fun,"l1e said, quickly adding that
“all the pieces are wonderful. I
mean, for me to be able to play
them all in one year is just total
selcindulgence.“

Mr. Gaub was born in Washing-
ton, DC, the son of a violist and
a cellist, He remembers being enr
couraged by his parents to pursue
piano as a career, “I think it might

have been a vicarious thing with
my parents," he said. “because
they were both musicians, but they
were amateurs."

By the age of 16, he had decided
to make music his life. liiiliiedir
ntely after graduation from high
school, where he had played organ
in a rock band. he enrolled at
Juilliard. Here. he was directed
more or less toward a performing
career. “I wasn't really happy
there," he said. ”I think if I had it
to do allover again, I would have
come to a place like Grinnell, and
practiced a lot during the summer."

Mr. Gaub began teaching at
Grinnell last fall. In his time here,
he has been struck by the number
of students who study music per
formance. “There are 90 students
who study piano alone,” he said.
“But it’s a different mentality from
a conservatory, where people prac-
tice all day long."

During the Sesquicentennial
Capstone Symposium several weeks
ago, Mr. Gaub performed John
Adams' Phrygian Gate: in connece
tion with the composer’s visit to
campus. The piece presented prob
lems ofinterpretation for Mr. Gaub,
hovJever, who found some of
Adams’s markings unplayablc, As
a result, “I took some real liberties
and i thought he was going to have
a fit." Adams's reaction wasjusl the
opposite, however: “He told me I
didn‘t have to be so literal!"

three pieces choreographed by stu-

Heiland says that the class “has had
an effect (on troupe) because they are
hungry to see other types or work."
Hart says that the class has “made me
more aware ofchoreography styles."
