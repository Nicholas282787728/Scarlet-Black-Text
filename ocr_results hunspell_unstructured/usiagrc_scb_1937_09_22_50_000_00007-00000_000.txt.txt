Speaking of sports, the dc.
pertinent of athletics wishes
to announce that tank snits
purchased for the basketball
team will instead be issued to
swimmers. The gymnasium is
even now staggering under
the weight of a new, guaran—
teed leak-proof roof. In order
to keep the dignified old
structure from slowly crum—
bling into n heap of rubble,
a little old-style farm ballng
wire has been pressed into
service, and the lee looks

our friends might keep posted on
local conditions, we made a trek
to the little grove across the

And another warning. Those
mosquito bites all over the
face and arms would be a
dead give-away the next
morning.

 

 

Of course no place on earth can
be perfect, but it does seem that
we're getting more than our share
with those mosquitoes and the
birds. Huntington Harris had
the first bulls~eye of the year
scored on him this week as he
stepped off the train, other vic-
tims include Walter Rowley and
Robert Schutt. The smartest trick
of the year was pulled by one of
the S. a; B. staff who brought
back an umbrella to stave off
bird—bombing attacks. It will prob-
ably bc only a matter of moments
now until Major Herschel Colbert
unleashes his antieaircraft artil-
lery along Shanghai Bund between
the quad and ARK, but after
years of service, those birds are
