LET US HAVE LIGHT ‘

After extensive efforts on the part of the
administration, there is at last an adequate
number of electric lights on the campus to
insure a reasonable amount of illumination
at night. We have, here on the campus,
enough guards patrolling the grounds at
night, but even these guards are helpless
unless the present number and wattage of
lights are maintained.

The guards and lights furnish sufficient
protection against thieves, marauders and
peepers, as, unfortunately, because of the
nature of the grounds, it seems inevitable
that we must have some of these posts
around. So far to date there have been
several prowlel's caught before they have
had a chance to do serious injury.

Lately, however, thoughtless students
have Jeopardized the efficiency of the night
watchmen by destroying or unscrewing
light bulbs ill various sections of thercam-
pus. This in itself, outside of creating a
thoughtless waste, is harmless enough in it-
selfkbut without the lights the men on duty
at night are handicapped greatly. We urge
the students to cooperate with the college
authorities in this matter and not to wane
,tonly break out the lights which only make
it easier for campus nuisances to carry on
their depredations. ’

THE COMING 'IMPROVEMENT’

This Friday and Saturday will feature that
time»honored campus diversion known in<
terchangeably as Freshman Improvement
Days ‘and “Hell Week.” This year special
committees in each hall have charge of
prepping activities It is up to these com-
mittces to choose a middle path between old
fashioned brutality which accomplishes
nothing and a complete lack of disciplining
which leaves out whatever constructive
value these Freshman Improvement Days
may have.

Three years ago it was decided to change
the name of this traditional function from
“Hell Week" to Freshman Improvement

Days. It is not to be wondered that it is a
slow process to change the meaning as well
as the name of this semi-annual activity.
But it is; 3 worth wllile attempt, and prog-
ress is being made every year. To turn the
”Hell Week" spirit to a constructive pur-
pose is another one of those things in the
doing of which Grinnell can claim to be
among the first.

Several of these hall committees have al-

ready laid partial plans for a constructive
“Hell Week." The White House has been
selected for a general going over with many
odd jobs attached. It has been suggested
that some of the halls that lack definite
plans might put their preps to work repairs
ing the old campus benches and building
new ones where they are needed. There has
been a real need for this for some time. We
are sure that C. A. Palmer would be glad
to suggest many equally worthy projects,
and we urge the hall prepping committees
to get ill touch with him if they have not
yet decided on a definite program.
' Last year such plans 215 these were suc-
cessful as far as they were tried. We hope
that there will not be a hall on the campus
this year that will fail to emphasize the
constructive side of “Hell Week.”

G
SHALL WE DANCE?

“No man ill his senses will dance.”

So said Cicero back ill the days when
dancing was frowned upon by the high
brows. Yet, in this modern day, dancing is
now a major indoor activity and is espe—
cially so at Grinnell. Because of this fact,
it is greatly necessary that one knows how
to get around the dance floor.

Popularity is not entirely dependent upon
dancing ability, but it is a good asset and
a visible sign that one has some promise of
being a good date. One may have a gift
for conversation, ploy bridge like a profes—
sional, or be a whiz on the zytllel', but peo»
ple often neglect to notice things like that
when they see a person standing on the
sidelines of the dance floor.

The college is now sponsoring a dancing
class for all those interested ill learning to
dance. Instructions ill the fundamental
steps are given each Friday evening, and as
progress is made the latest and more coin-
plicated routines are taught. No harm can
be done ill making a try at the art of dzlnc»
illg, and, certainly, a lot of benefit can be
obtained by enrolling in the dancing class.

BOOKLARNIN'

(Reprinted from University Daily Kansali)

Parents often expect too much of college as
their respective sons and daughters trek to
the various campuses. They invest money
and time to give Johnny more years in the
educative process so that “he’ll have an
easier time than when I was a kid." With-
out considering the raw material or pre—
vious training, fathers especially, who foot
the 'bills, want a finished product that
approaches the combined product of a fin-
ishing school, riding academy, business col-
lege, and Dale Camegie's courses.

Four years of attending a school df
higher learning will often mold raw material
into a modern, streamlined product. But ill
all likelihood, the process of college educa»
tion will not teach the student how to look
for a job; his manners shan’t improve unless
he attends a modern culture school that
goes in for social training; he’ll have little
association with his pl'ofessol'sf unless he
seeks it and he usually doesn’t; and if he
does not possess the gift of public speaking,
college seldom teaches him how to give a
good talk ill a conversational voice that can
be heard; he will probably enter the busi»
ness world as trusting as a lamb; and he
isn‘t let in on the secret that the world isn’t
waiting impatiently for him to step out and
take over.

of course, the college graduate with his
degree is not as naive as this. And for the
next four years, college is probably the best
place for the Average high school graduate.
But parents, and the freshman himself,
should dispel the illusions that warp reliza-
tion of what to expect from the finished
product.
