”I'mvery happylobealGnnnell
College" says Rabbi Sharon Stiefcl,
the new director of Grinnell Hillel,
“l‘m very impressed Willi the Sttlr
dentinitiativeand eag essto take
a pan in the responsib ’es of be-
ing in Chalutzim, the Jewish Stu-
dent Organization."

Stiefel, who received her ordi-
nation from the Reconstructionist
Rabbinical College last May, has
already worked with congregations
in New Jersey and Council Bluffs,
Iowa, as well with college students
in New Jersey and graduate SlU'
dents in Philadelphia,

She sees Reconstructiomsmdhe
newest of the four branches oflu»
daism, as being “on the cutting
edge" of Jewish renewal and re-
vival, Speciﬁcally it emphasizes
lay involvement and egalitarian
ism, and makes an effon to include
modern interpretations of prayers
along with traditional ones, and to
eliminate sexist language. Says
Stietel “One of the mottocs of the
Reconstructionistmovementisthat
tradition has a vote, but nota veto."
S tiefel herself incorporates creative
Observances along with more tradi-
tional ones.

in deciding to come to Grinnell,
Stiefcl cited as areason thestudents
