the Harassment Education Com-
mittee (HEC) will sponsor their
ﬁrst study break in Loose Lounge
Nov. 7.

One word that probably
sums up what SGA has been do-
ing lately is "Surveys" The word
won't make "Wheel of Fortune."
but more surveys have gone out
in the past month than at any
other time in SGA history, at
least what I remember of it.
Surveys on Films, Concerts,
SGA communication, and the
Waltz have gone out. Results
have now been tabulated A stu-
dent-to»student survey is being
conducted by President‘s Com-
mittee this week. Also, an open
discussion on smoking and an
Open Forum on Library and
Bookstore Policies happened this
week. Hopefully, the word for
next month will be
"implementation."

The issue I would like to
discuss this week is how we view
ourselves as a community. Indi—
viduiilism is emphasized at Grin-
nell quite a bit, and I couldn‘t
agree more with that philosophy.
The question is. are we the type
of individuals who can also take
the time to give some thought to
our fellow students as well. l'm
sure at some point in each Grin—
nellian's life there has been a
time when somebody went out of
his or her way to make each of us

feel good or respected. It hap-
pened to me as a prospective, and
that is why l'm here. It has hap-
pened to me every semester since
then, and l'm still here Lately
though, a few little things remind
me that it still takes an effort to
establish that community feeling.
I believe in some areas we have
become a little lax.

The ﬁrst thing is all this
talk about smoking policy. I feel
it is high time we discussed our
likes and dislikes about smoking
and decide as a community how
we should conduct ourselves re-
garding this issue. However, a
point was brought up in Joint
Board and again in the open dis-
cussion on Tuesday. If someone
is bothering someone else by
smoking, a simple, tactful re-
quest to change the situation can
go much farther than any policy
ever could in remedying the
problem. We as individuals can
certainly be expected to respect
each other enough that, by sim-
ply communicating our feelings,
we can work this or any other
problem out.

The second thing is
consistent, planned, and rather
shameless line cutting At ﬁrst I
thought I should ignore the
problem, then I thought the
problem would cure itself, then.
alter a 25 minute wait for dinner

on a Tuesday night, I thought
that it is not the action that really
bothers me so much as the atti-
tude it conveys ( or developsl).
Line cutting was something that
was done by tough kids in junior
high, but line cutting (I'm talk-
ing about the folks who go to
dinner looking to cut or cut as a
group most of all) is a voluntary
act that tells the people behind
them that the linecutters care
more about eating sooner than
about respect, Call me silly. but
don't deny the fact that if some-
one cuts in front of you with not
even a second thought you feel

rather insulted. Big deal to some,
but if a person continually values
my respect less than his or her
palate, what is to stop them from
not respecting others in other
situations. What is to stop him
or her from forgetting to hold a
door if I need a hand, or not go-
ing to a recital or athletic event,
or not voting in a campus elec-
tion or simply being one of those
folks Ihat do just ﬁne at Grinnell
but never ever really make Grin~
nell something more than a de»
gree factory. Maybe it is just
me, but I don't deal well with
anybody who cannot at least
