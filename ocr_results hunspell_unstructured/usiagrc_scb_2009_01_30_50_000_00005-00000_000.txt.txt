Burn After

Reading
(2 008)

Gym rats that want to be spies

Eton Aﬁcl Reading is, in many ways. a
quintessential Cocn Brothers ﬁlm: it contains
sharp, funny dialogue, a host of distinctivc
characters, and does unorthodox things tvirh
plot and structure. And not everyone Likes it.

Since the coen Brothers have already
shown they have Oscar talent with No Coim»
h-y For Old Men and Fmgﬁ. many oftlie critr
ics who disagreed with Bron After Reading
may have elevated their standards for a genre
that doesn’t have very high standards to begin
with. We're talking about comedy, of course,
in which a movie can get decent reviews if it
at least has some ltind ota coherent plot to go
along with the typical laughs.

The Coen Brothers, though, do the exact
opposite. Going tor dry black humor rather
than easy laughs, the film’s plot uses recently
ﬁred CIA employee Osborne Cox's (John
Malkovich) lost memoir as the beginning of
the story, but quickly delves into international
espionage, marital affairs, gym politics, and of
course, the Russians get involved.

The plot is somewhat tedious and circular
(you’ll catch my drift if you make it to a crucial
scene about an hour into the movie), but the
laughs and the scenarios are far from typical.
so much ofthe dialogue sounds so logical unr
til you actually stop and consider how ridicur
lous the given speaker and context are.

Laura Lidzke (Francis McDormand) is so
intent on her plastic surgery, while Chad Feld-
heimer (Brad Pitt) is a zany physical ﬁtness
instructor that gets involved ‘in a blackmail
scheme with an eerlA agent. Please read
that last sentence again.

As “cm" would suggest, there is a deﬁnite
spy element to Burn Aﬂcr Rmding,just as there
is in Tbe Bzg Lrbowrki, another Coen Brothers
jam, But unlike that movic,wherc “Thc Dudc"
is actually mistaken for being a spy (even
though he totally isn't, man), the people that
are controlling the spying in this movie are the
ones in power.

Occasionally, the film goes beyond these
purely entertaining ideas and enters into the
realm ofsocial commentary One ofthe issues
that comes up is that ofonline dating, revolving
around Lidzke meeting Harry Pfurret (George
Clooney) through their onlinc proﬁles, In dift
ferent sccncs, we see thcsc characters cithcr
scrolling their computer screens and looking
at potential dates or walking in a park, where
a series ofanonymous races are scanned by the
character walking. anrrer and Lidzke meet
when they both recognize each other from the
website as Pfarrer is sitting on a bench.

If you’re one of those people for whom
plot is a must, and you won't really be able
to get behind a movie that ends as arbitrarily
as it begins, Burn A/m Roading might disnp»

point. The ﬁlm stops abruptly. You need the
first 90 minutes to appreciate the end, but the
relationship between the two is devoid of any
signiﬁcant suspense or elegant design.
However, the film will entertain those look
ing for a good time. Whether ‘it’s the lntel‘es"
ing examination into issues like online dating
and alcoholism, its outlandish and memorable
characters, or simply the great dialogue, Bum
After Reading will not disappoint.

In Bruges
(2008)

Buddy gangsters in Belgium

I rarely stumble into a gangster ﬁlm based
on the insistence of my 82-year-old gmnd~
mother. Yet I tagged along with her after she
offered me a ticket to go see “some feature
about Bruges’hvith her. With just this to work
with,l expected slight amusement at the best
and utter boredom at worst Instead, I saw a
hilarious dark comedy that painted over the
typical buddyrcop trope with themes otdearh
and revenge, guilt and innocence. With my
82-year-old grandmother.

Donagh's first ﬁillrlength ﬁlm, and a sure
prisingly good one at that, The ﬁlm revolves
around Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan
Gleeson), two Irish hirmen dispatched to lay
low in Bruges, the picturesque, medieval Bcl-
ginii town after Ken’s accidental shooting of a
young boy.

Ray and Ken, shipped to Bruges on the or
der ofthcir shortrtempered boss Harry (Ralph
Fiennes), spend a good amount ofthe ﬁrst half
bickering over whllt to dtHgo sightseeing or
get drunk, Like a parentrchild combo, Ray
drags an antsy Ken around Bruges, allowing
Farrell the opportunity to showcase his irrev-
erent and fussy behavior in from of some of
Europe's most beautiful sights.

When not completing the tourist circuit,
Ray spills his woirics and concerns to the {elk
gious Ken. conversations regarding Ray’s need
for forgiveness and neairsuieidal thoughts and
Ken’s steady. wise reassurance are free otsacr
charine or unnecessary comic touches, giving
the movie its believilblc and melancholic base.

Unsutprisingly. both characters soon run
into trouble, forging a relationship that avoids
ﬂirting with the 1edidn't-realize-you—werer
mytsoulmate-until—now cliche‘ and effectively
deals with sacriﬁce and torgiveness.

is easy to forget, providing little more than op—
portunities for Farrell to be humorous or tent
der until Ken’s insecurities ﬁnally unravel.

Undoubtedly, the most remarkableY and
surprising, aspect of In Brugc: comes via Far»
rell's performance. Farrell is an actor who most
would associate with summer dmdge and for-
gettable, pathetic excuses for action ﬂicks. But
after seeing Kruger, it’s easy to forget the past
and embrace his role as the excitable, hearts
hreakingly vulnerable ltitman. His portrayal of
both an innocent child and a guilteridden man
rightfully earned Farrell his best actor award at
this year’s Golden Globes.

Beyond Farrell, the movie continues to
shine. Glccson counters Farrell's manic per-
soiialitywith an oldei, hardened, but still 50ft
spoken demeanor. Fiennes has little screen
time, but commands the ﬁlm when he speaks
And look out for the aptlyrportrayed caricar
tures ofthe morbidly obese American and the
invasive Canadian,

At times, the movie strays too tar from its
subtle path in the name or cheap, easy humor
(see: prostitutes, dwarf, cocaine), and one train
scciie near the end of the film has no worth
beyond acting as a pathetic plothole plug. But
overall, In Burger is a riotous movie that leaves
the viewer with sore sides and a sad, but hopes
ful, heart.
