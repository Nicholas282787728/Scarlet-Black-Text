Hall “B”
renamed

Board of Trustees names hall
after Hannibal B. Kershaw, Grin-

nell’s first black graduate

BY SARAH MIRK

Hall “B" remains nameless no longer.

During their board meeting in April, the Board of
Trustees approved the dedication of the hall in honor
of Hannibal B. Kershaw, the first black graduate at
Grinnell. According to Mickey Munley‘87, vice pres»
ident of Communications and Events, it has always
been the intention of the trustees to name Hall “B"for
a historical ﬁgure rather than a major donor.

”We have some incredibly generous people who
help to support the college,” Muniey said, “But it is
also nice that we have the opportunity to reach into
the past and make it part of the present.”

The development committee on the Board of
Trustees recommends and chooses naming opportu-
nities for most places on campusThe names of major
entities, such as buildings or large spaces, are voted on
by the entire board.

The board had narrowed the prospective naming
pool down to "a small handful of
candidates" by the beginning of
the year, said Munley., But the
Board took their time in order
to be “especially deliberative"
about who was finally chosen.
According to Munley, there was
a growing consensus throughout
the year that the building should
be named after Kershaw, not only for being the ﬁrst
African-American Grinnell graduate, but also be
cause he was a “humble" person and “a great orator"
who used his graduation as a stepping—stone for even
greater things in Life.

In considering honoring an historical ﬁgure with
a building, the person must be “of great stature, admie
rable and also have resonance in the present day," said
Munley. He said he believes that Kershaw is someone
who will continue to inspire students into the funire.

East campus, believes that ﬁnally naming Hall B is a
step toward all of East campus “solidify[ing] itselfin
the campus culture." The building itself is “essentially
the same residence hall,I feel the new name will allow
the building to be seen as a more permanent ﬁxture in
the campus community," he told the Smile! and Black
via email. The dedication ceremony
will take place in fall 2005 and will
include the placement of a small
name plaque on the building.

The reaction among students
to the renaming has generally been
one of approval and Grinnell irony.
Rumors have been spreading via
plans that next year's slogan of the
substance—free Hannibal Kershaw Hall will be "We
consume people, not substances,"in reference to Hans
nibal Lector from the movie Silent: eff/M Lambs.

Munley said he was worried about the possible
joking that would nccompany christening the build
ing with the name shared by the famous cannibal and
did not think that any gentle jesting would be disre—
spectful to the esteemed late alum. instead, he hopes
the students will “be proud ofKershaw and will want
to know more about who he was. . ,Si/erire afthe Lambs
came way after Hannibal Kershaw."

Who was Hannibal
Kershaw?

Despite a life cut short by lung disease,
Grinnell‘s first black graduate boasted many

accomplishments.

BY SARAH MIRK

In the bygone days of1879, Grins
nell college graduated its first black
student 7 Hannibal B. Kemhaw, clas-
sics major. One hundred and twenty-
six years later, Kershaw will return to
campus, this time with no hope of
leaving, beginning with dedication
ceremony next fall, Kershaw will be-
come the namesake of the East Cam-
pus building previously known as B.

Kershaw's graduation from cole
lege was an astounding achieve-
ment for a black man who grew up
in South Carolina during the Civil
War. According to the Iowa College
Newsletter printed at the time of his
death, “Kershaw was an earnest, con-
scientious student, a ﬂuent society
speaker, and a man whom all respect-
ed for his high moral character and
religious character."

College graduation was just the
beginning of Kershaw’s against-all-
odds accomplishments, however. “Ul-
timately what got him noticed was
that he was the ﬁrst AfricaneArnerie
can graduate," said Mickey Munley
‘87, vice president of Communica»
tions and Events, “but what got his
name on the building is what else he
did."

Upon graduation, Kershaw re-
turned to his native state and worked
as a teacher. in 1881, just two years
after graduation, Kershaw was elect-
ed to the South Carolina legislature

“by an overwhelming colored vote"
according to the Newsletter, only
to see his election “counted out by
the methods peculiar to that section
of the country." Two years later, he
was tinishing a course oftheological
reading and was ordained a Meth-
odist minister.

Five months after becoming a
minister, Hannibal Kershaw lungs
were attacked by a serious, but then
unknown, disease and he passed
away. He was 26 years old. Munley
hopes that honoring the building
with Kershaw’s name will inspire
students to remember the pioneering
alumnus who came to this campus
before them. Even while so young,
Kershaw was ambitious, intelligent
and accomplished,“That’s what we'd
like all the students here to have as
part ofwho they are," said Munley.

Kerhaw's name may have been
relegated to the history books had it
not been for Black History Month in
1998.To celebrate the month, Grins
ncll College hosted Henry Wingate
’69, who gave a memorable speech
entitled The Glyn! ingiznm'bul Kerr
i/m‘w. This speech, says Munley,
“brought Kcrshaw’s name back into
the modern Midwest." Kershaw was
rediscovered at a crucial time. With-
in a few years, his name made it onto
the small list of prospective persons
the trustees considered honoring
with a building. The rest is history
