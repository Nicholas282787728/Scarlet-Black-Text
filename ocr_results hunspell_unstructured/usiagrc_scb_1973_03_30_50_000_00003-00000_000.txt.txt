IaCroix: Daiiiler IiiiOn’tAmnesiy

‘To the Editors:

One certainly has to read an awe
ful lot between the lines to under-
stand Gregg Daffner's “Iconoclast”
column oi March on amnesty. He
devoted so much space to vague
meanderings in political philosophy
that he barely got around to dis-
cussing amnesty, and he never did
indicate clearly how our government
has "disgraced” itself and how
draft resisters who have fled the
country are ”injured”.

Some pacifists might hold that “no
man (or nation?) has the right to
initiate physical iorce against anor
ther man,” even to combat arson or
murder; but that isn’t the issue at
hand in determining the validity of
drait reiusal and the subsequent
need for amnesty. Conscientious
objection to all wars, including phr
ilosophical objection without religir
ous content, is now recognized by our
government. Those who have fled
the country are aware of this fact.
They have iled because of objection
to performing the alternative ser»
vice required, or, more commonly
(and Daffner to the contrary), be
cause they object only to the par»
ticular war in Vietnam iust ended.

There are certainly many, inclu-
ding this writer, who consider the
U.S.A.‘s participation in the Wet
nam conﬂict immoral and contrary
to international law and the U.S.
Constitution. Many ofus would agree
that draft resistance in this limited
Situation was a moral and justifiable
act, though not yet legally sanc»
tioned. It is not correct, however,
to say that draft resistance violates
”no other person's rights." To make
up ior those who escape the draft,
Selective Service has had to fill
its quotas by calling up others whe
ose service would not otherwise have
been needed. That these people have
served ohediently due to ignorance
of the nature oi the war, lack of
knowledge of resistance alternati-
ves, etc. is beside the point. Their
liberty in Daffner's terms has been

Silin: loss

To the Editors: -

Many people write saying what is
wrong with this institution Some say
it is academic pressure, some say
there is not enough sex and I think
the administration of this school is
messed up.

Just recently Ihe school gave up
the services of Marjorie Daley.
This is a loss and a jolt to the
school. She said that she was lea-
ving ior personal reasons, but what
are these personal reasons:7 There
is something or somebody(s) in the
administration that made it impos
sible for her to stay. She could have
stayed on in the sence that they
would have given her another con»
tract but they presented her with a
repulsive situation and this forced
her to leave. When Marge Daleyleft
she had to say it was for personal
reasons because that is part of her
professions ethics and educate.

So next time when you are wonder
whats wrong with place and you are
Walking to town, look to a white
house on Park street, and see if
you iind what I have round.

violated, Also, far from “sacrific— ,

ing their own liberty," those who
have fled abroad have done so to
preserve it, living as free men in
societies that do not presently re-
quire their military service.

In admitting that few have argued
for unconditional amnesty, Daffner
seems to realize the dull futility of
his argument. As long as Nixon is
President and the majority oi AmeV
ricans align themselves with the
p.o.w,s, the wounded, and all ot—
hers who have served in war with
blind obedience, this country would
be a very uncomiortable place to
return to, and many resisters donct
desire to do so anyway. Time must
pass and emotions dissipate,

Aside irom the above, iew come
mothers have noted so far the tact
that many at the resister-exiles fled
prematurely and have not been dr-
aited in absentia and iound in Vio-
lation oi the law. They can return
without penalty and resume normal
lite. As a lirst step, we might
realistically hope that machinery
will be set up whereby these exiles
or their representatives can assure
themselves of immunity from pror
secution before hazarding return,

Union: Requests Boycott, Aid

To the Editors:

There are 155 courageous people
at the Dow Chemical plant in Bay
City which has been on strike for
14 months. They would like to enr
list‘ the aid of your newspaper and
members of the student body sothat
we may survive. Dow Chemical is
using its unlimited resources in an
attempt to destroy us economically
and eliminatethe collective bargain-
ing process of our locaIUnion

Many workers and their families
have suffered unlimited hardships
in the loss of income and personal
property which they have had to
sell in order to feed their fami-
lies because Dow Chemical refuses
to resolve an unjust labor dispute
provoked by Dow Chemical and its
local,management.

In the interest of humanity we ask
that you print this letter in your
college paper and that the student
body aid us by reiusingtobuy Handi-
