The movies for this weekend are:
sinalion Bureau (1969). a
tonguesinrcheek story or a would-be
woman journalist who tries to uncover
a group of paid assassins; and Captain
, Blood (1535), a swashbuckler, which
was Errol Flynn's first movie,

In The Assassination Bureau, Diana
Rigg plays a women’s libber who
decides she wants to write the best
story of the century, She goes to the
publisher oi the biggest London
newspaper (Telly Savalas) and he
gives her the financial backing she
needs to uncover the Assassination
Bureau, Limited.

This bureau is a highly moralistic
company. It seems that it has long
been their tradition to kill only people
who deserve to be killed.

ﬁigg meets with a man named ivan
Dragominov (Oliver Reed), the chair
man oi die Assassination Bureau, and
she hires his company to kill him. An
offer, which, surprisingly enough,
Dragominov accepts; he explains to
all his assassins that this means they
must kill him before he kills all oi
them. What Rigg doesn't know is that
the publisher (to whom she is sending
daily reports) is also vicechairman of‘
the Assassination Bureau, and he
thinks all this moralism is wrong. He
wants to use the bureau to control the
world. The plot is further complicated
by the fact that Rigg falls in love with
the'chairman of the bureau and ends
up helping him escape with his life.

' ‘lle Assnssinnlion Bnrcnn is too
ridiculous to he played straight
(especially a delightful scene in a
Paris \vlioreliouse), but it’s hilarious
when they play it tongue-inrcheek, The
direction and the comic timing are
perfect. The result is a delightful
movie which no one should miss.

Captain Blood is the story of Peter
Blood (Errol Flynn), an English doc-
tor unjustly convictcd of treason and
sold into slavery. i-ie escapes rrom his
owner (Olivia de Haviland), and
becomes a pirate. Once again the plot
is complicated by an unusual love in
terest when Blood falls in love with his
owner.

In many ways this film is out of
datc.'The acting is stilted and the
whole thing is riddled with Clich "
The dialogue is very unusual it ‘cms
almost Shakespearean at times, out the
mDVie is still a lot oi t'un. Flynn is me
credibly charismatic and the cast
(which also includes Basil Rathbone
and Lionel Atwell) is excellent.

Have you ever been to one of those
suspense, Charlton Heston, disaster,
stock actor, annoying characters, Ir-
win Allen movies, and wished you
were somewhere else, anywhere else,
including a bus going Crossﬁouiitl‘y?
Well, now you have a chance to fulfill
your wish, The Big Bus, to be shown
over break so as few people as possi-
ble will see it, stars Joseph Bologna
(in another undynamic performance)

and Stockard channing

This movie is a satire of all the
disaster epics which have plagued our
lives tor the last decade. A great idea,
but it misses the point. Bologna is a
bus driver in command of the first
nuclcanpowered bus to go irom New
York to Denver nonstop. One horrible
atrocity iollows another as they cone
tinue along in the movie: a bomb goes
off, the brakes rail, cliff-hanging ex-
citement. The little old lady screams
in horror. Everybody runs irom one
side of the screen to the other. Won-
drous events, wondrous cliches. You
may even get a laugh out or it every
now and then, some of them may even
have been intentional

Not that Big Bus doesn’t have any
redeeming qualities tanything that
makes fun of disaster movies can‘t be
all bad). There are some good
moments, but there is much more to
be done wtth satire of disaster movtes
than this even attempts. ‘
