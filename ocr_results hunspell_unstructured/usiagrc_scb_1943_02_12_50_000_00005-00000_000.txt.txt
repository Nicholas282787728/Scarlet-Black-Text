GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

|n+ramural Cage Season Going Full Speed;
Dibble. Clark In Lead Wi+h Clean Sia’res

Dibble, paced by Dick Ga»
dient, started the season off,
pushing over North Read last
Thursday night by a count of
17-10. Rawson and South

‘ Redd did little better against
, them this Week, leaving Dib-
ble out in front of the race
with three wins and no
losses.

Clark's combination of Moi-
lins, Brady, and Jack Crandall
proved too tough for a scrappy
town team Tuesday night, giving
the latest quad residents a share
in the top bracket. Their hall—
mates, South Read put up lit-
tle opposition to them last night
losing 23 11

Town stormed over Gates Sat-
urday afternoon by a score of
31—13 to break even thus far in
the win-loss column. Sharing
third place with the town cagers

, is North Read by right of their
victory over Rawson Monday
night. Lee Roos has been playing
the inspired ball for this team.

South Road squeezed by Gates

In addition to Bluebird‘s exqui-
site color and guaranteed perfct,
tion, they are now insured against
loss. The name Bluebird uuly
protects your diamond selection.

Clark and Dibble are slated to

other likely contender for the
trophy. Town, however, already
shy on reserves, will be hardest
hit by the air corps reserve evac-
