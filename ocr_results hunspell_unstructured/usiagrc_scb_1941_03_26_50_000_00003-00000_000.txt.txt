“nether selective service will
draft them into the army before
they come back as scniors next
year. or looking ahead to the three
long years before they can finish

years a long time for anyone to
spend in the venerable old class
rooms on the campus.

Only 50 Year Minn

It is a long time, and Dr. Har-
ry Waldo Norris is the only per-
son in the college who has done
it.

“What a dull life," says the
1941 freshman, as he peers
through a microscope in the 20-
ology laboratory. trying to see the
things he has been told are there
to see. "I wouldn‘t want it. I'm
going to get away from here and
do something inteiesting and use
ful."

Knocked by shark‘s Talli

Professor Norris’ half a cen~
tllry as a Gn'nnell faculty mem-
ber has plunged him into danger
oils and exciting shark hunts in
the Gulf of Mexwo, where he
has been knucked head over heels
by a blow from a supposedly
dead shark's tail, a blow as nasty
as any ever meted out to an op-
ponent by Joe Louis or Jack
Dempsey. These 50 years have
sent him on travels in foreign
countries and interesting explora—
tion trips to the Atlantic, Pacific,
and the mountains, The postal
system has made his office in
Blair hall the center of the world
in his special field of scientific
investigation, bringing to him
their letters and packages of
specimens from scientists in all
parts of the globe.

The college student of today
has been brought up in a. time
when he has heard of little but
uncertainty. disaster, the end of
progress. since Professor Norris
became a regular member of the
faculty in 1891, he has llVed a life
of stimulating uncertainty, the
uncertainty of forward looking
progress. He has seen the college
grow from a small faculty and
student body in Blair, GODdﬂ0\V,
and Magoun halls and the Music
building and Mears cottage to its
pl'ESent Condition. He watched the
building of the men’s and worn—
en's gymnasilu‘ns, and With other
Grinnellians was proud of the fact
that they were the finest physi-
cal recreation plants in this part
of the United states. He has seen
every other expansion of the
campus and its faculty.‘

The greatest portion of the
alumni has gone out from Gl‘inr
nell since Mr. Norris began ‘his
work here, and a large number
of his pupils have reflected credit
on him by establishing themselves
throughout the world as impore
tant men and women of science.
His research and writings have
gained hnn international recogni—
tion and membership in learned
and professional societies. Having
devoted the major portion of his
time in the last few years to re-
search, he retires at Commence
ment in June under the college
regulations on retirement. free to
devote himself to a continuation
of his investigations, reading, and
writing as he sees fit.
