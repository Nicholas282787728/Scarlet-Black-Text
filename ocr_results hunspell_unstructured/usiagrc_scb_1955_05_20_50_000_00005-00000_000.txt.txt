Pioneer Cindermen Seek Loop Title

The Scarlet and Black track team, 18 strong. vies for
top honors in the 33rd annual Midwest conference track and
field championships held today and tomorroll' at Carleton
college, Northfield, Minn. All nine Conference schools are

entered in the meet.

be held tomorrow. Honorary
referee tor the meet is Henry
Taylor, former Knox track great,
who set a IOU-yard dash rec.
ord of 9.6 in 1930 which still
stands.

Grinnell, rated among the top
three teams by loop dopesters,
was seriously hurt when Charlie
Westrup, the team's leading
hurdler. sprained his ankle last
Tuesday. Westrup was personale
.y responsible for six points in
the 1954 meet with a second in
the low hurdles and a fourth
in the highs.

Carls and Cornell Tops

Carleton and Cornell, along
with the Pioneers, are likely
to stage a close fight for the
crown. All have top men plus
good balance. Both Carleton
and Cornell are stronger than
they were last year when they
finished fourth and fifth. Cor-
nell in particular has made great
strides. Grinnell has almost the
same team that finished second
last year.

Monmouth, last year’s dark
horse champion, appears dese
tined to drop a few notches, but
is probably stronger than the
rest of the field. Lawrence,
Knox. Coe, nipon, and St. Olaf
have some good men, but not
enough of them to challenge
the top teams.

Champs Return

Nine individual champs are
reutrning to defend their laurels
These nine champs cover ten
events, since one of them, Dick
Vogt of Monmouth, will be back
to make it three years in a
row in both hurdle events.

The returnees include Bob
Phelps, George Drake, and
Dick Walker of Grinnell. Also
back is Pioneer Clyde Greeno
who copped the pole vault in
the ‘5; meet and finished
third last year.

The remainder of the title-
holders include Wayne Phillips
of Coe in the ZZDsyard dash;
John McOamant cf Carleton in
the half-mile; Bill Baird, shot-
putter from Cornell; Bryan
Valett of Cornell, broad jump:

Commenting on
chances in the meet, head coach
E. G. Booth said, “You never-

There’s a uhance that we'll be

said that finishing in the top
four would be no trouble, but
the chances of winning, now
that Westrup disabled, are
not the best.

Monmouth 147/2-1/z.

Knox’s chief competition ap
pears to come from Lawrencc
again. Last year the Vikings fin-
ished seven strokes back of
Knox, 6154522, of the 14 men
who broke 160 last year, six are
back, and of these six, two are
from Lawrence and three from
Knox.

It is impossible to rank Lawr~
ence on the basis of dual meets
since the Vikes have met only

Ripon, and Ripnn has not met
any of the other ronfeience
schools. Lawrence heat Ripon
10~8, which indicates that Ripon
may improve on last year’s
fourth place finish.

Dick von Maur and Lee Sa

age, Gi‘lnnell’s only returnees
from last year’s meet, will be
flanked by sophs Jim Anderson,
Rad Amlie, and Jim Gabrielson.
Savage scored a as-hole total of
164 and von Maui» 188 in last
year’s loop meet.

Golf coach Irv Simone Com-
ments that, ”Although we won
only two out of eight dual meets,
and were second in the Drake
tournament, we feel that we
have a good chance to place high
and an outside chance to take
it.”

St. Olaf and Carleton, third
and fourth last year. are best
bets for the number four spot,
while Grinnell has the edge on

Cos, Cornell, and Monmouth.
