He gave assurance that special pm—

need financial aid. “We have not for-

He mentioned, also, the fact that that

In speaking of the chance in rates

DRIVE FUR WAR WORK
PLEDGES SUCCESSFUL

Fow' Unpaid Pledges Amount to Only
Ten Per Cent oi TomliScrid Final
Report In Soon.

The drive for ﬁnal collection of the
United War Work pledges started last
week is nearly completed and the few
remaining pledges are expected to be
accounted for inside of the next few
days. Provision was made for paying
up the pledges after the men reached
home, and in necessary cases it was
arranged for parts oi the pledges to
be paid now and the rest later.

Among the girls the pledges have
been coming in equally well and it is
hoped to send in the final report from
Grinnell soon after the end of this
weel Only about ten per cent of the
pledges were cancelled, a compara-
tively small number for so many suh-
scriptions, and these were only in a
few necessary cases where the student

'hod either left school or found it im—

possible to meet the pledge during the
summer. A number of men found that
they could not return to school after
the demobilization of the s. A. T. c.
and their pledges were left in a few ‘
nstances, unpaid.
