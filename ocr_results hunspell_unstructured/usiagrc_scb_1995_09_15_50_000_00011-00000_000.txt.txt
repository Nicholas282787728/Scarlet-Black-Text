Sports in our society: issues relevant to everyone

DORIAN SHAGER
SPORTS EDITOR

It is important that our campus
remains informed on issues in sports
that are relevant ro all ofus. Sports do
not only affect athletes and sport con<
rioisseurs. Sports have become a large
part of our society and have many ram—
ificationsrhroughourourculture. Thus.
the Scarlet St Black feels it should ad-
dress these larger issues that not only
concern spots. but more importantly,
the issues that also concem and affect
all ofour lives.

Spore as a whole have many di-
mensions and are difficult to classify.
Sports are recreational activities which
maintain and improve ourphysicalcon—
dltlons. Sportsaresocialactivities which
function within the evenchnnging and
important social structure and dynamic
interplay of a team or friends. Sport can
be a competitive activity With mental,
physical, and intellectual challenges.
Sports can be an entertainment outlet
for nonrparticlpants. Sports can pro—
vide business opportunities and the re«
lated problems concerning contracts,
strikes, and rights.

Because there are so many parts of
life that relate to and are affected by
sports, the Scarlet 5t Black should not
simply be reporting scores and high—
lights of sporting events. This would
notbebeiieficialtoourcampus. Itisour
hope that by maintaining a weekly col«
umn which focuses on these issues, we
can better deal with ihe largerspectrum
‘of social events and attitudes that con
cerii all ofus

In the coming weeks, we hope to
addressawide range ofissues,especially
those that directly alrecr us here on
campus. Furthermore, it is our hope
that these articles will be informative
and beneficial not only to rhose who
considerthemselvessportsfans.butalso
to those who traditionally do not read
the sports pages. Most ofall, we hope
that the scarier st Black highlights and
reports on the important issues that
reflect the role oisporrs in our society.

Title IX:

gender

equity in sports

KATHARINE J AGER
STAFF WRITER

With recent lawsuits filed
against such big—name schools as
Brown University and University of
Texas, the issue of gender equity in
sports has become a touchy subject
in academic circles.

In 1992, female athletes at
Brown sued the university because
of its decision to drop the varsity
status oftwo of its women's athletic
teams. CitingTitleIXlaw,the wom—
en won the case. However, Brown
appealed that decision last spring,
submitting a plan for capping the
size of its men's athletic teams, in»
stead of proViding more opportuni
ties for female athletes.

Essentially a civil—rights code,
Title IX of the Education Amend—
ment of 1972, states that ".mo
person in the United Statesshall, on
the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the ben-
efits of, or be subjected to discrlmh
nationunderanyeducationprogram
or actiVity...” In terms of athletic
programs, this means that, by law.
men and women should have equal

opportunities.

The issue of “equal opportuni—
ties," however, becomes hazy when
it is examined interms ofboth mon-
ey and participation. As is the case
here at Grinnell, a Wide variety of
athletic teamsibotl’i Varsity, Junior
varsity, and clubimay be offered.
But. in many cases, the women's
athletic teams frequently receive
only junior varsity status, and thus,
less money,

At most colleges and universir

ties, the percentage of female and
male undergraduates does not equal
that offemale and male athletes. In
Grinnell, for instance, the percent»
age offemale—male students is 52%
to 48%. The percentage offemale
male athletes at the college, howev»
er, is 27% to 29%. At larger, Divi-
sion I schools, thedifference in num»
bets becomes more dramatic. At the
University of San Diego, for examr
pie, the female—male student ratio is
43.3% to 56.7%. The female—male
ratio for athletes is 38.2% to 61.8%.
And at the University of Wyoming
the ratio is even more off balance,
with a female—male student ratio of
47.6% to 52.4%, and an athlete ra—
tio of25.1% to 74.9%.(7215 Chron—
icle of Higher Education, V4l n9,
pgs. A46—A47, A51)

In terms of funding, the fact

 

that the ratios are disproportionate
affects how much money is allotted
to the men‘s and women’s athletic
teams. Dee Fairchild, Director of
Physical Education. explained that
the Office of Civil Rights decrees
that the femaletmale ratioofathletes
at a school should be equal to the
female—male ratio of undergraduate
students at that school. The dispro—
portionate number of male athletes
at so many schools, then, requires
that the male athletic teams receive
more money. This obviously leaves
female athletes with feweriarid less
equalﬂppottunities.

According to Fairchild, foot—
ball, with its large team size, contrib»
utes to these disproportionate nume
bets. “Many schools run into gender
equity problems due to the numbers
[created by football]," she says, And,
because there is only so much money
to go around, men’s teams get mostof
the funds allotted to athletics.

But the issue is not so straighte
forward,otsosimple. Itisnotmerely
a question of football upsetting the

Grinnell’ 5 cross country teams stretching to improve. At many schools, mens and
women’ 5 teams are in conﬂict regarding gender equity Photo by Erin Husu'ngs.

female—male ratio, or even an easy
redistribution of funds. There is the
other, more important issue of the
lack of participation in women’s ath—
letics. \X/hile 3.4 million boys play
on high school sports teams, only
two million girls do. This, ofcourse,
translates to a proportionallysmaller
number of college women athletes,
in comparison to male athletes. Ti—
tle IX clearly states that both sexes
should have equal opportunities to
participate in athletics, but the ques—
tion still remains as to why there is
such a disproportionatelysmall num—
ber of women playing sports to begin
with. The problem, then, goes much
deeper.

In the following weeks, we will
examine Grinnell’s efforts to comply
withTitle IX, as well as the attempts
of other schools in our Conference.
We will also address the issue of why
there is such a smaller amount of
participation in women’s athletics.
when compared to men’s; and we
will examine the problems this issue
has presented to female athletes here
at Grinnell.
