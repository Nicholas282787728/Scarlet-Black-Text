Pryor among cast in BCW movies

By Nancy car-penici-

Black Cultural Weekend is the
occasion for two recently released
black films that were boxroffice
successes. The Bingo Long
Traveling Allsmrs and Motor
Kings is an excursion into a largely
unexplored area of American
black histoi'yithe days when

major league baseball was an all:

white enterprise and blacks were
relegated to the Negro National
League, where the only thing

worse than the wages was the‘

playing conditions. These are the
comic adventures of a group of
lively black ballplayers who
decide to barnstorm across the
country, playing white and black

than a baseball comedy, the movie
iocuses on friendship and per-

The second movie for Black
Cultural Weekend, presented
jointly by CBS and the Film
Committee, is the movie biography
of Billie Holliday‘s life, Lady Sings
the Blues Billie Holliday, who died
of drug addiction at age 43 in 1959,
has been called the greatest blues
singer America ever produced.
The best actress would find it
difficult to portray the great lady
to everyone’s satisfaction,

Diana Ross, however, the queen
of pop music in her first major
acting role. turns in a fine job.

While her voice may not have the
reed‘y, hurting quality of Holliday’s
voice, she gives her all as she sings
and the emotions in her voice
evoke rather than imitate the
original. This choice to suggest the
star's lite instead of copy it, made
by Director Sidney Furie, saves
the film from becoming just
another star biography and gives it
an original look. Critic Judith
Christ calls this bid-minute film a
work of “grace and grit.” The
supporting cast includes Billy Dee
Williams and Richard Pryor.

The week’s third film is a pair of
early silent shorts. Tillie’s Punc—
tnred Romance from Mack Sen-

nott's famous studio is one of
Charlie Chaplin's comedies
Chaplin plays a scheming gigolo
who attempts to relieve a country
lass of her wealth. The Keystone
Kops are featured in a final chase ‘
sequence.

Seven Chances stars and is
directed by the pan-faced Buster
Keaton. He portrays a young man
who will inherit a fortune if he
marries within the next twelve
hours. After six miserably un-
successful attempts, Keaton winds
up in a church with 500 would-be
brides. Overcome by the situation,
he flees, with the women in hot
pursuit.

Affirmative ActiOn surveyed

(continued from p. 3}
a law degree and has been a
member of the iowa Civil Rights
Commission.

HOMERIN said that the Board
isvstill “very concerned about the
Affirmative Action aspects
highlighted last year in the
reorganization" (the firing and
rehiring of women faculty mem-
bers Georgia Dentel and Kathy
McCluskey) and that this concern
is reﬂected in the Board’s apr
pointment of the special ad hoc
committee on Affirmative Action.
But he “sensed less immediate
concern on campus” because the
immediate problem of the ad-
ministrative reorganization has
been resolved. He added that the
trustees are especially concerned
about the decline in the number of
black faculty members.

Lowrv sees the major difﬁculty
with the Affirmative Action policy
regarding faculty as the large
percenmge of tenured white males

‘ among the present faculty. He said

that it would be to the college’s
long-term advantage to “look

 

twice" at some qualified male
teachers in its search for
sexual and racial equality.

LOWRY also [eels that the
Grinnell College campus is more
concerned with Affirmative Action
regarding women than regarding
minorities and thinks more em-
phasis should be put on recruiting
minorities.

He believes that the “college
ought to do a little soul-searching"
on its Affirmative Action
priorities. Noting that there is
“less concern on campus for
minorities than for females,“ he
said, “We have a long way to go at
Grinnell to understand the basic
problem concerning blacks on
campus.” He observed that
despite past injustices committed
toward blacks at Grinnell, he has
never seen an uproar over
minority discrimination here such
as the one over the administrative
reorganization last year.

POINTING out that this ems
phasis on women’s equality is a
nationwide trend and not confined
to Grinnell alone, anry said that

people can identify more with
problems of females than with
those of minorities. He said,
“Affirmative Action, for me, is
basically white and female, The
hue and cry concerns injustica
toward white females."

The trustee committee’s job,
according to Lowry, is to “offer
guidelines or formulate policy, but
it is the responsibility of the ad-
ministration and faculty to im»
plement policies."

' THE issue or Affirmative Action

came up elsewhere last weekend
besides the official committee's
meeting. The subject was
discussed when the trustee
committee on community life met
with Concerned Black Students as
well as during a discussion of
tenure for faculty members.‘ Also,
SGA President Jon Neiderbach
and other SGA members ad-
dressed the entire Board of
Trustees on the subject Saturday
morning,

ACCORDING to Board Afr
firmative Action committee
members, the trustees are very
concerned about Affirmative
Action problems and are going to
be strong in their commitment to
Affirmative Action. “Everybody
believes in Affirmative Action. It’s
just like motherhood,” said Lowry.
