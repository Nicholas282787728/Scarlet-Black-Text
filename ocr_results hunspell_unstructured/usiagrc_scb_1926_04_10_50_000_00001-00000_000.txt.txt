BULLEGE iiiilllisls
lﬂ Niﬂll WEEK

stoic University Will Entertain The
College Press Organization on
April lo and 17.

The Iowa College Press Conventioni
which convenes in Iowa City Friday
and Saturday, April 16 and 17 has
secured for its program Dr. Edward
Price Bell, special writer and lecturer
on foreign affairs for the Chicago
Daily News. Dr. Bell, a noted author-
ity on international problems is re-
garded as an exceptionally fine lec~
tnrer on journalistic subjects, As Lon-
don corrcspnndent and European inan-
agerof the foreign service of the Chi-
cago Daily News for twenty-two years,
he has gained wide experience
and knowledge of world problems. All
the chief news events of the past
years have been reported by him and
he was the first correspondent and
journalist to interview a British Seer
retary of State for foreign attairs He
has spend much‘ time with the British
fleets, armies and flying services, all
of which experience eminently qual-
ifies him as an unusually inter-
esting speaker. Carl Sandburg, a
tormer associate of his on the Chi—
cago Daily News, in his recent visit
to Grinnell, spoke very highly of Dr.
Bell, congratulating the convention on
being able to secure him for their pro-
gram. Editors frcm all over the coun—
try, who are familiar with Dr. Dell’s
work have written, congratulating the
College press association on securing
him zls a speaker for its annual
convention.

The program formerly called for
five round tables to he held on Sator-
day afternoon, James Work, presi»
dent of the lowa College Press Asso-
ciation, has anncuced that a change
has been made in this plan for the ac—
con’lmodaticn of those who might
wish to attend more than one round
table. Two of the round tables have
been piaccd upon the Friday after-
noun program.

The appearance of Harold N. Swan-
son, editor of College Humor, on the
program will be of special interest to
Grinncll students as Mr. Swanson is
an old Grinncll man, known to many
of the students here now.

The major part of the entertain—
ment is in the bands of Iowa State
university journalism organizations.
The delegates will be entertained at
the sorority and fraternity houses, and
the banquet Friday night and luncheon
Saturday noon will be furnished by
these organizations, with this taken
into consideration, the expense of at-
teudance for Griuuell people will he
very small since the registration fee
of two dollars is paid by the Scarlet
and black for all members of the
staff.

The program, which is fairly com»
plete up to date, promises to he of
great value, with the names of leading
journalists and of faculty members of
the leading journalistic departments
of the Iowa colleges and universities
appearing on it. The program is as
follows:

Friday Morning

10:00 Registration for delegates at
Old Capitol Building.

PHEP BAH—NNNL MEET

Alumni Interscholastic mrimiiull
Track illid Field Meet (0 be RC-
sulucd After Lapse of Year.

After a lapse of one year the annual
Grinnell interscholastic invitation
track and field meet will be continued.
The date has been set as May 1, so
as to allow the entrants every possir
hie chance to attend the meet.

As in former years the carnival will
be sponsored by the Grinnell Honor G
club and all the competing teams will
be quartered and fed in the men’s
dormitories during the meet. Invi-
tations are now in the mails to nearly
1000 class A high schools of Iowa,
Nebraska, Missouri, South Dakota and
Minnesota. Entries are expected to
set a new mark for this event which is
looked upon as secondary only to the
State meet. ,

All events are scheduled for the one
day with the possible exception of the
javelin which has not been run off in
previous meets.

The events offered are: 100, 200, and
4-10 yd. dashes, 120 yd. high and 220
yd. low hurdles, half-mile and mile
runs, one-half mile relay, high and
broad jumps, pole vault, shot put, and
discus throw,

With a full mouth of preparation
and two or three weeks of competition
for most of the high schools, the Grid-
nell interscholastic should entertain
some sterling performances and some
new records are expected to be made.

Winfield was the winner in 1924 and
has one leg on the cup which goes to
the school winning the meet three
years in succession. ,East Des Moines
formerly held two legs on the trophy.
but with the crowning of Winfield last
year the former loses all claim toward
permanent possession of the cup.

President J, H. T. ilain, Dr. Edward
A. Steiner and Dr. E. W,.Cross, of New
York, are three of the eleven especi-
ally invited guests to attend the ec-
clesiastical council which will be held
in Newton, Massachusetts, April 15, to
install the Rev. Roy A, Ellsden as min-
ister of the Eliot Church of Newton.

Hendrixson Memorial
Not Over-Subscribed

Prof. H. W. Nol s calls attention to
a misstatement of the press that the
Hendrixscn Memorial Fund has been
uvel'rsullscrihed. That would be im-
possible, he adds. One of the ori inal
stipulations was that no subscriptions
were to be binding unless the total of
the subscriptions reached a sum not
less than $10,000 by July 3, 1926.
Fortunately that point was passed
months ago. The subscription lists or
the fund are still open for additions,
and it is hoped that the $15,000 mark
lnfty soon be passed. Most of the sub-
s l'illtions have been paid in Cash, have
been invested and will soon he y'leidv

MEN SINGERS EBNHE
HII IN ANNUAL NNNE
NNNBEEMITEAHANEE

Club Gives Evidence That Caption
“Best in ﬁle “'esi’i” is Anyﬂling
But Idle Nomenclature.

CLUB HARMONY BALANCES

Phlno Selection, Chopin’s “I’oloniiistw
by Loren Adair, Is Bright Spot
of ihe Am‘nuiil Concert,

BF Curtis Lninb

Appearing in Herrick chapel last
night in the annual home concert, the
Grinnell Men’s Glee club gave re-
newed evidence in its best numbers
that the caption. “best in the west," is
not idle nomenclature.

All credit to the club for beginning
on time. Maintaining a good pitch
throughout in spite of the absence of
the piano, the first numher, Foote’s
“Bugle Song,” was given with no any -
pleasing harmonies. True, the tenors
were none too firm in places, yet on
the whole, the harmony was well bale
anced and the song was well received
by the audience, such as it was. A
good deal of seifrpossession was shown
for the first piece. and even more zest
and abandon was evident in the en-
core, “song of Winter,“

As Mr, Miller took his position by
the piano for his solo group, he did
so with all the poise of a virtuoso. In—
deed, one felt that he must certainly
have had more power than he exhibit,-
ed in his two solos, “Back Again in
Eldon," hy oley Speaks, and “Hy-
brias, the Cretan," by Elliott. He was
nt- his best in the lower range, and
merited the encoring which followed ,
the second number to which he re-
sponded with “Sylvia," For his accom-
panist, Mr. Adajrnone can have only
high praise. His playing was far from
obtrusive, yet always gave ample sup
port to the soloist.

Perhaps the most difficult number
of the evening was the “Ocean’s Gar-
den (Seaweed)," a. song picture of
the rolling surging, bounding, Lumb<
ling- sea—realistic tn the core with its
changing tempo, yet lacking in perfect
harmony and coordination of all the
parts. Enduring with "Morning Hymn,"
the club made up for all preceding
errors, effecting almost perfect con-
sonance and displaying considerable
Power. ,

Dancing fingers—with touch light
and airy, or with heavy attack, at
will, made Mr, Adair’s "Polonaise,"
by Chopin, one of the bright spots of
the evening. itachmaninoff's "Humor-
esque” was an encore well adapted to
his touch and exhibited unusually
clean pedal.

A distinctly popular number, the
first resounding chords of the accom-
panimeut to ”Soldier's Chorus," from
Faust by Gounod, set bend assenting to
the quick time. The number was not
difficult, however, and featured the
piano more than the ensemble.

Contagious smiles would certainly
have livened Wagner's "Sailor Song,"
for with its changing accent and fast
tempo, it was a rollicking German
drinking song. The same number was
repeated as an encore.

Two well groupcd selections which
followed, “Foote’s "into the Silent
Land,” and Sullivan's "The Long Day
Closes," were well chosen for con—
trast with the precceding number and
with the crisp tones of the “Vagabond
Song," used as an encore.

Presenting two movements of
"Concerto in G Minor” by Burch, Dir-
ector D. E. Peck displayed better tone
quality than usual and proved himself
more than able to meet the technique
demands of a most difficult piece.
Both in this number and the encore he
showed vigour and feeling at all
times.

"Under Blossoming Branches," by
Zel'litt, was given without the piano
as was Brallms’ "narcarolle." the Sec~
and number 01' the last group. "nar—
carolle" was much applauded by the
audience to whom the alliteratlve type
or ballad always appeals.

There is undoubtedly an unusual
appeal to every true Grlnnclllau in
the Otis-Oids "Alumni Song" the con—
cluding number, but somehow, one can
find grounds for feeling that the pec-
uliar spice and ginger of the words
and or the clear, sparking 'melody
make the "Alumni Song" 'Lhe best glee
club song we know.
