Symphony Orchestra Performance
Delights Critic With Ability

Praises Young Musicians
for Work in Concert
Friday Night

(By E. Walter Huffman)
The current concert series was
most suspiciously opened Friday

evening by the Kryl Symphonylglad to notice the impartialityt

orchestra. New to the Gl'innell
campus, this group of young mu-
sicians played itself into popular-

rthat he hadn’t time to drop things
on the floor.

Everyone knows the bewitching
'music of the “Scheherazade." The
[orchestra was particularly facile
lie the difﬁcult. passages which
labound in this work, We were

with which the solo parts were
[distributed and the executive shill
ldisplayed by all. Mr. Kryl cons

accompaniment would have been
more effective at one dynamic

Happy ”Rapport".

A happy “rapport"
pertormers and hearers is a
strong psychological factor in the
enjoyment of music. We had such
a "rapport” this evenin . A cris
tic is always less cruel in the face
of public approval of a performer.
We shall show our good nature
by forgetting most of the hobby
horses which were dug out of the
musical grabsbag and presented
to us as cncol‘es~we shall forget
all but three: thc Musettc from
Puccini’s “LhBoheme” so delight-

played as a final encore by the
orchestra Encores are like the
fish in a bazaar fish pond; once
in a while you catch something
that is worth the price.

Mr. Kryl and the young musi-
cians convinced us of their ability
in the Overture to the “Barter-ed
Bride." Smetana did not write
this for beginners. We were de»
lighted with the verve and pre»
cision with which the canonie
passages were played, and we
were swayed by the dynamic ebb
and flow of tone and the purity
of intonation maintained through—
out. We were astonished by the
nonchalance with which the doll—
ble bass players sped over the
page at 60 per. A certain face
ulty member was advised a short
time ago to take up the double—
bass and join the college arches:
tra because the parts were so
easy to play, We would now ad
vise him to stick to his cymbal

American Composer.

Paul White, a modern Ameri-
can composer, did a good job in
his "Five Miniatures." You rec
ognized the use of the whole tone
scale and you knew that the or-
chestration was not exactly Hay~
dnesque. Mr. Kryl gave a thor-
oughly captivating portrayal of
these sketches. The English horn
player deserves a blue ribbon for
his good work in the “Caravan
Song.” Had you ever thought
what a musical portrayal of a
Hippo dance would be like. or how
much like or unlike a sputtering
trumpet mosquitoes actually are?
We enjoyed the spirit and finesse
with which these numbers were
performed. We were glad, too, to

ness and imagination of his play-
}crs and of his own musicianship

‘tlle work.

‘ Convincing interpretations.

l Most of us who have heard
‘the standard symphonic work:
late prejudiced in favor or the
greater sonority and magnificence
of effect which is possible through
[larger resources. Generally speak
ing. the modern composer on or»
chostral works has the instrui
ntentation of the standard sym-
phony iri milltl, He plans the
balance between the different 01's
chestrnl choirs with full know»
ledge of the capacities of each
one. We miss this fullness of
tone and balance ot choirs when
a small orchestra attempts a ma-
jor symphonic work, Only on this
point could we have wished for
more in the pcrtorrnance of the
“Largo" and “Scherzo" of the

us convincing- and valid interpre-
tations of the work, It was a
happy choice of his to present
this composition, the inspiration
of w icli springs from our own
soil, Tire name “New World"
a compliment to the
this inspirati .

In his solo Ml. Kryl delighted
us with his virtuoso powers, We
felt that he might have given
less thought to theatricalisni and
more to the beautiful rernet tone
of which he is a master. Miss
Bona revealed a competence in
the playing of the hat-p which
readily won her the generous ap-
plause of the audience. Miss
Maxwell was greeted spontane-
ously for her artistic singing of
“Depuis le Jour” from Cllal'penr
tier's opera “Louise.” We cannot
praise too highly her musicianly
qualities, yet we could have wishr
ed for more vocal resources in
the climaxes, Mr, Kryl’s sensitive

Skolkos was graduated from
the University of Toledo in June
and received an appointment to
the government high school in Las
Mal'ias, Pucrto Rico, early this
summer; he assumed his duties on
August 24, signing a one year con—
tract fer the position.

“Everything is grand here," he
writes to a friend in Toledo, “or.
cept the bananas, which are
served at every meal in a variety
of disguises Gardenias line all the
walks leading to the school.”

Whether or not it was “apples
polishing" Skalkos doesn't know
eaxctly, but on his first day as
principal he mentioned that he
was fond of horseback riding. The
next day three of his pupils
brought horses to school for his
use. They told him that their fath—
ers had reminded thcm that they
must treat “El Americana" well.

TILE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Detroit Coach
Suggests Way
to Judge Gridders

.(By Associated collegiate Press)

Detroit, Mlch~Coach Charles
E. “Gus" Dcrais of the University
of Detroit has evolved a new
yardstick for the measurement of
football playel'sia yardstick that
tans at all colleges and universi—
ties will find helpful in sizing up
the qualifications of their athletic
classmates.

According to Dorais, here are
the 10 things that are essential to
the ideal football player:

1 Coordination. This implies
muscle response and quick reflex
es As Dorais sees it, strength,
speed, and agility are of little use
to a football player unless he is
able to coordinate these qualities.
Fast thinking is of value only
when coupled with ability to trans-
late the thought into instant mus-
clllzu' rcsponse.

2. Condition. in order to play
tepnotch football a man must be
in such perfect physical condition
that he can go through rt game,
or such part of a game as he l'cs
mdills in the line-up, without
slackening his speed or thought of
action.

3, Enthusiasm, No man can
hope to be a great player without
boundless enthusiasm for the
game.

4 Mental alertness, The great

football player must have ‘9. fast
acting mind. He must be con-
stantly on the alert to meet the
varying situations that arise both
[on offense and defense,
' 5 Courage. Both physical and
moral courage of a high order are
essential, Football entails a lot
,of hard knocks and the man who
is afraid of getting hurt will never
be a success at it. Moral courage
iinplics ability to keep fighting in
the face of reverses.

o. Cooperation. A player must
be willing to cooperate with his
fellows and his coaches.

7. Sizc. It is a wellrproved are
iom in sport that “a good big
man is better than a good little
men.” For that reason the ideal
football player should have a rug—
ged physique and adequate
weight,

3, Mental stability. The good
player will he a man who can re
tain his poise under all conditions.

9. Application. There is a lot of
hard work, almost drudgery, con-
