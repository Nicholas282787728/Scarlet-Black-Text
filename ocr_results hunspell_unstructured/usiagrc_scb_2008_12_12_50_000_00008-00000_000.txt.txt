Despite their title, none otthe Prison Plays
that will be shown tonight actually feature sto-
rics about inmntcs or life in prison. Instead,
they will highlight the crcative‘ imagination
and storytelling piowess of the men at the
Newton Coitectional Facility in some of the
funniest, most heait wrenching, and most bi-
zarre productions you’ll ever see.

Grinnell students, who also went to the
prison last night to perform them at the facil—
ity, will perform the plays at the Wall at 7pm.
in Bucksbaum as staged readings.The plays are
the culmination of the playwtiting class taught
by Emma Silverman '09 and Caitlin Davies
’09 at the facility, a class that has become a
mainstay ofthe Grinnell College Prison Work
Shop Program.

“It's a really wide variety of plays from
comedy to the avantrgarde to drama," Davies
said. "You can tell that some of the plays are
kind of close to the heart, probably some of
things these men haVe dealt with, and some of
them are just hysterical,"

Davies ﬁrst got started in the program
when she taught an acting workshop a few sc-
mesters ago. Since she's a theater major with
plans to go into education, the workshop pro»
gram was a no-brainer for her, and she’s on»

“It's one oftht: most rewarding things I've
done at Grinncll,"she saidi " I get to work with
people from a wide range ofbackgrounds and
who have been stereotyped as a certain cat-
egory of people But really thev re no different
than anyone else, and they have fantastic ideas
and its been amazing to harness them

Jaysen Wright ’09 is in two of the prison
plays: “The Park” and “of? their Rockers". The
first is a story of a young woman struggling
with her impending pregnancy, (in which he
stars as a the girl’s father), and the second is
a comedy about a mental facility, in which he
plays a patient. “I think it’s a really awesome

little to look forward to beyond piles ofsnow
and homework until after winter break.

So how do we make it through the next
few weeks without falling into the downward
spiral ofscasonal depression?

You guessed it. Snow art.

Snow art comes in a myriad of different
forms, some more traditional than others, It

and women (see High street) to elaborate

icicle spirals (see Andy Goldsworthy).

Last semester I went to a student lunch
with a man that was being considered for
the Art Department's painting professorship.
Having gone for the food.l don't remember
too much ofthu meeting, However, one art
group that the candidate mentionttl stuck out
in my mind

The group, based in Vienna, is called Gelie
tin. They dabble in a variety of media. one
of their more memorable pieces was sewing a
gigantic stuffed pink bunny and stretching it
across terrain near Colletto Fava Mountain in
Northern Indy.

But getting back to business. Gelatin
(Gelitin the internet cannot seem to de-
cide which
it is) had a
show in the
far north that
the prospecr
tive professor
had visited.
The exhibit
was two stos
ties. On the
bottom visitors feasted their eyes on a gigantic
(and growing) yellow icicle that dripped from
the ceiling.

on the top floor was a toilet-like tube
structure into which Visitors were invited to
urinate, adding to the icicle.

responsible fol its unnatural aesthetic forma-
tions.

Another source otinspimtion for snow art
can be round in Andy Goldsworthy. A well-
known earthrworks artist from Scodaud,
Goldswotrhy is known tor site—speciﬁc pieces.
He rearranges rocks, leaves, dirt, branches and
other natural materials to make art works in
the natural environment.

Many of his works are transient, disapr
pearrng over time as they are weathered by the
elements. His snow works include carvings
into snow drifts that evanesee with the wind,
painstakingly (and glovelessly) fusing icicles
together in new ways, and making drawings
using snowballs,

On snow-
balls, Gold-
sworthy had
this to say: “A
snowball is
simple, direct
and familiar to
most ofus.l use
this simplicity
as a container
for feelings and
ideas that function on many levels."

His work is all about reworking nature in
away that makes a person look twice at it and
see new potential in scenes that we encounter
on a daily basis, This aesthetic doublcrtnke,
as I like to call it, provides us with an excels
lent tool for propelling ourselves through the
winter surrounded by beautiful and interesting
things.

So, be it another form ofprocrastinution or
an artistic endeavor in and of itself, snow art
can help us got through these next few weeks
with smiles on our faces and art’s warm lire
aglow in our hearts.
