In the early 1990s, evercompetitive Grinnell set the
standard for dominance in a single Spon- Between 1991
and 1995, no non—Grinncll cross country team, mcn’s or
women's, won the Midwest Conference.

On a crisp autumn morning last Saturday at Oakland
Acres, one of diosc two powers continued its dominant
ways, while the other tried [0 take
the ﬁrst steps towards reestablishing
them.

Keeping up tradition, the Grin.
nell men, as expected, took the rest
of the MWC by storm.

Winning conference is nothing

14 times in the last 15 ymrsibut
rarely have they done so with such
dominance as was displayed on sat.

Four Pioneers medalled by rin—

place Monmouth. No other team
managed to dip below 100, as the few schools who had the
top runners to compete with the Pioneers clitc lacked the
depth to hang with Grinncll.

The Pioneers have such a strong team this year that
their only weaknesses come out of their strengths,

“We have a lot ordepth, especially once we get to our
ﬁfth runner, and It kind ofworks [D a disadvanuge soma-

"[Conference is] a lot of
fun, and for a lot of the
team it’s their last meet
of the year, so it's the big
show for them. Everybody
gets really excited about
it, and even if we expect
to win it's still nice."

are really packed together. A lot ofgood teams at nationals
keep their spread [the variance in ﬁnishing times or the
top two runners] down to under a minute, and ours has
been more like two.”

“its really good to train with not many runners.“ Boom
added, “it keeps people motivated and running fast."

Part of the time diirerential in Grinncll runners is due
to booth himself, who outran every
body en route to a convincing ﬁrst»
place finish. His 25:11 time vvas
down nearly a minuteand. halt
from last year's champion.

So dominant was Booths chort,
in fact, that only two runners Cm.

one of those was Grinnell's Noah

but still snared third place overall

Mart Shamey '03 and Jim
Hackett '02 also cleaned up tor the
Pioneers, rrnrshing ninth and 10th
and securing crinnells MWC title.

Forgive the men, however, iitlrc
thrill otdefending their crown yet again has iailcd to wear
off

“it hasn't become routine at all,” said Booth. “It’s a lot
or run. and for a lot orthc tcam it's their last mccr orthc
year, so it's the big show for them Everybody gets really
excited about it, and cvcn irivc capcer to win its siill nice."

Head men’s coach Will Freeman also said that he was
pleascdgvith rhc win.

“1 was very happy with the win." Freeman said. “Grin.
nell has a history otdoing well in this meet and we wanted
to continue the tradition, especially since we were at home
for this one. We also showed great improvement rorm last
year's conference meet. Most oi the runners had very sig.
nirrcant time-drop: this year compared to last year,"

Theseaxon ended on Saturday for all but the top seven
runners from each team, who advance to near Saturday’s
regional meet, also at Oakland Acres. There, the pioneer
men havea legitimatc shot otnnishing in the top tourasa
team and advancing to nationals.

The women’s team. however, has little chance ordoiirg

with a 10th place ﬁnish, stands any chance oiadvancing as
