Solid begins its
sophomore year

Student group faces uncertain future

while dealing with issues of past

xv AMELIA KOFORD

At some point, every activist has to struggle with the qucsa
tion of reform or revolution, whether to combat the system or
work within it. The student group Grinnellians for Solidarity, or
Solid, is grappling with that very question as it begins its second
year on campus.

While many of the students who gave Solid a visible and
controversial presence last year have graduated or decided not to
continue their work with the group, several underclassmen have
attempted to reform Solid with a new agenda. However, even
with the prospective changes, the group still faces some of the
same structural issues that plagued its ﬁrst year, and so far has
not been a big presence on campus.

Solid originated in March of 2004 after the arrest of Paul
Wainrig'ht ’07 for a Plans posting that the administration
deemed threatening. According to Greg Chatterley ’05, Cassie
Donnelly ’06 and Noah Siegler'oo, three otthe group’s founders,
Wainright's arrest was the culmination of a series of administra
tive actions that made students feel that they were not being
heard, “The administration seemed to be handling things top-
down, which got people in trouble unnecessarily,” Donnelly said.
Solid advocated greater communication between students, fac—
ulty and staff by pushing for a stronger community through self-
governance and administrative transparencyTlle group focused
on several issues, including tuition increases, dining services, and
drug and alcohol policies. “We decided that it shouldn’t be fo—
cused on one thing, but the general lack of concern and care"
among members ofthe Grinnell community, Sicgcler said.

Some ofSolid’s ﬁrst and arguably most successful events were
a series of sit-ins during Admitted Students weekends, where
they sat on Mac Field and in from of the John Chrystal Center
wearing tcshirrs reading “Ask Me About" and an issue, such as
self-governance, dining services, PLANS and others aimed at
creating discourse with prospective students and their parents.
Solid’s tactics and posters generated both positive and negative
attention on campus. The sit~ins exempliﬁed Solid‘s direct ap-
proach to reaching its goals without using the structures of the
administration or student government,

Solid remained popular for several weeks, but participation
began to dwindle toward the end of the year, in part due to the
groups lack of structure-the founders did not mnt Solid to be
leader-driven,but \vithoutdirection, the group ﬁltered. “To some
extent, people didn’t want to do their own thing," said Chatterley.
“They wanted to be told what to do" Donnelley said that none

.of the founders planned on continuing the group in the fall.
other Solid members, however, Wanted the group to remain
a fixture of Grinnell. “I didn't want to let it die,".said Claire Pat-
terson ’08, one of this year‘s organizers.

Another organizer, Max Postman '08, took a ﬁrm stance on
the need to reform Solid. Postman said he wants to form “a
more mamle Solid" this year, focusing less on pressure tactics
and more on discourse, He said that there is often “tension be—
tween an inﬂammatory side and those that are more concerned
with speaking to the administration on their terms and in their
language."

Fiona Martin ’08, a third spokesperson, secs this year's Solid

as a continuation rather than a break with the past. “Its purposes _

have evolved, obviously,” she said. According to Martin, 5on
will use mostly conventional methods, but that the group did not
rule out more direct action. “SGA will do as much as they can
within the system, and ifthey need help or ittheres something
they really can’t organize, that‘s where we would step in,”

One shift in Solids tactics is its plan to work closely with
SGA. Four Solid members ran forjo'lnt Board, and Postman and
Cid Standifer’07 were elected to serve on it. SGA officers John
Bohman ’06, Chris Ochoa '06 and Matt Cleinman ’06 all attends
ed Solid's ﬁrst meeting and expressed their support Bohman
said he “wanted to make an effort to bring people who were dis-
enchanted with the system into the process.” Bohman said that
he sees great potential for Solid and SGA to work together.

But while some students hope for a new and revitalized Sol-
id, the group has not been very visible and is still confronting
structural issues.A.lthough Patterson, Postman, and Martin have
assumed informal organizing roles, Solid still lacks official leadv
ership, which has led to uncertainty about who should dictate
Solid’s mission and speak on behalf of the group.

Solid has also met only once since the year began when it
assigned people to follow wrions issues such as construction
planning and dining services. According to Postman, solid is not
currently planning any events or campaigns.“We have issues, but
no concrete plans,"he said. “were not going to contrive an no
cuse for action, When we see that there is an issue of sufficient
interest to galvanize the campus population, then we will act"

Town-gown fighting

While students and residents of the town interact on a limited basis, a
close relationship has formed between Dag and the original Grinneilians

By TIFFANY Au

Playing with kids from Davis E17
ementary is often cited as a successful
bid to strengthen town-gown relations,
but perhaps the college should con
sider trading in jump ropes for swords.
That seems to be working in the case of
Dagorhir, the group that allows people
to earn their own nicknames and fight
to the fakecdeilth with foam weapons.

While most students do not in-
rerucr regularly with residents of the
townipeople who are often referred to
somewhat derisively as “townies" the
labels melt away
when it comes to
Dag. According to
Ben “Gobi” Bow»
man ’08, "The [difc
ference] between
the college and
non-college kids is
not deﬁned, If you
look at them, they
interact with each other in the same
way You can't tell the difference."

For most townspeople, it is easy to
join Dag. According to Adam “Ziggy"
Doorenbos, 19, the longest ﬁghter in
Dog and also a worker at Qlud, “I saw
some pcoplc ﬁghting and l asked, hey,
can I learn? They said sure! And that‘s
how I started."

Doorcnbos said he enjoys hanging
out with Grinncll students and said
that Dag is “easily accessible, people
friendly, and just good run." Many

”/ think town/es ﬁght Dag berause
we welcome them regard/€55 of
age or gender, orifihey go to
school or not.”

Dag-townies joined because they ei~
rher heard about Dag from friends or
approached the Dag members after
watching a battle.

According to Tyler “cardinal” Ellis,
15, "I started when I Bust turned] 15,
after seeing a bunch of people ﬁghting
in the PEC."

On the other hand, Tyrel "Pear
nut” Lohse, 15,joined because he “was
paintballing with some friends and they
had a Dag sword at their house. Then,l
came to a night session".

Dag is the most visible, if not
sole, group to ac—
cept townspeople as
members. Bowman
said he thought that
might be because the
organization extends
beyond the school,
“It’s a national or-
ganiznlion so it’s

natural for us to accept
people who atelth part of Grinnell Cole
lege," he said.

The divide between students and
members of the community blurs on
and off the battle-field. According to
Zach “Fenrir"Aakel Y07,“We're close to
many town members. One [Dag] mem-
ber lives in a house in town with two
townies and some of my best friends
are townies."

For members or Dag, whethcr one
is a townie isn't an issue. “I didn't realc
ize until the end of the first semester

that they weren’t Grinnell students,"
Bowman said. While students like to
claim the mantle of Grinnellians, they
do so ironically, for townspeople are the
original Grinncllians. “We’re not ours
siders,” Dootenbos said.

Kent “Beanpole” Cubbage ’06 said,
“I think townies fight Dag because we
welcome then regardless of age or gen
der, or if they go to school or not. If you
have an interest in Dag,we love you. It’s
not like you have to be into roleeplaye
ing or Star Wars to join or like other
people who seem incongruous."

In fact, the Dag House has become
a hangcout place for Dagclownlcs
and students alike. Since the 24chour
lockdown doesn't apply to off-campus
houses, the Dag house is accessible
to all. “The house provides a place
for townies to gather and it broadens
Dag's social circle," Cubbage said. He
also said that it is not uncommon for
romantic relationships to form between
townspeople and students.

A house located on High Street,
called Townie House, is also a place
where students and Dag-townies con~
gregater "Dag kids who graduated from
GrinneU high school live with college
students there," Cubbage said.

He said that like any group ofpeoc
pie living together, tension sometimes
exists between housemates, “but not
along Smdcntctown‘lc lines mostly
nerdy stuff like the difference in weap-
ons and ﬁghting styles."
