shopping in McNally's food store when
she was approached by a man in his
forties, The man, clad in dirty. cheap
clothes, solicited the student [or

money and made several lewd sugges- ‘

tions. The student responded with
some sharp words oi rebuke and the
man left the store.

When the student completed her
shopping she started back to campus
by way of the Pamida store parking
lot. Suddenly, the man appeared lrom
behind the corner of the building. The

student says that the man grabbed
her, roughed her up, slapped her once
and warned her that they would meet
again. Then he let her go on her way
with no further harassment.

The student has given the police a
des ription ot the incident and has
also informed the Oilice of Student Al-
iairs of the harassment.

In a related development, a commit-
tee of students and administration
people are working on ways to make
the campus saler at night. The com-
mittee is proposing improved lighting
and security measures to limit the ac-
cess to buildings [or Campus in-
truders. «
