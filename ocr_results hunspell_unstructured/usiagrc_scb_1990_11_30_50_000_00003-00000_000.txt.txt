“Americansshould always keep
’in mind that the US government
always messes up with its foreign
politics."

This was the first answer of a
series of interviews of randomly
selected international students on
their attitudes towards the situation
in the Middle East. Names have
been withheld by request.

The article contains quotAiions
that are carefully selected in order
to present the different ideas that
Grinhell's intemational students

A number of the students ques-
tioned favored U.S. and UN.

believe Iliat war iS u good idea in
this situation.

“The U.S needs another war,”
said one student.

Others. clearly annoyed with
Iraq's imastoit in Kuwait, think
“it's good the us is stepping in
Iraq’s way."

“Since whtitixhappcning on the
UN. and US, part is not against
international law, I have no ObjEC-
tion to theirprescncc there." Some-
one else said that the whole issue
reminds hitn of Afghanistan, when
the U.S. were trying to help the
people there and prevent the USSR
from expanding its territory.

Frustration was written all over
the faces of many.

an interestingly indifferent opin—
ion.

For students who live in or near
the Middle East. the terroref war is
more than a debate of ideologies.

“I‘m scared because it is really
close to my country. Bush doesn’t
know what war is because he has
never had it in his own country.
War is death."

Others were very skeptical of

President Bush's actions.

“It seems as though he is push-

Others were
particularly sick-

see as hypocrisy

Comments such
as “it’s just a re-
gional war. If it

nothing would
have happened,” and “I don't want
to see people getting killed over
oil," were commonplace.

Yet for some, this is not simply
a conﬂict over oil,

Another felt
that in order to

needed to intim-
tain careful dip-

“Bush needs
to find a way to
save Saddam's face without going
into a war, and at the same time
back out of Ich Gull.”

One person alleged that the en-
sis has arisen because of a secret

Finally there were those who
felt very bitter about the situation
pointing to the years ofconflict that
have followed colonialism,

“War should be avoided at any
political cost," said one.

“The U.N. and the U 8.," said
another. “should not be aggressors

Middle East where they don’t un-
derstand the society there. It is as
simple as that,"

Anti-War
Group is
Formed on
Campus

By Helene Eisenman

Thecristsinthc MiddleEaslhﬂs
induced some Grinncll students to
trike a stand against the threat of
warm the region. Members ofthc
recently formed Persian GulfAlert
(PGA) are prepared to protest in
opposition tozipossiblcU.S. attack
on the Iraqis. The group was orga
nized by students Dan Werncrand

Lrated at the lack of activity on
campus regarding the issue.

According to Werner and
Wittstruck, the group has two pflr
mary ohjcctives. The first is to
inform people who may know little
about the crisis. PGA has thus set
up a reserve file in Burling Library.
containing articles relevant to the
issue. PGA also plans to put up an
information board at the post of-
fice. distribute fact sheets and bring
speakers to campus.

Thesoeond goal is to lake active
opposition to the U.S. military
presence in lite Persian Gulf.

“We hope to be a relatively
militant group," says Wiltstruck.
“We envisioned itbelng torpeopte

There are approximately 70 stu-
dcnts now on PGA's computer
mailing list. PGA members have
taken part in a number of activities
on hehali‘ut‘theireaiise, including a
letter writing campaign, in which
members provided addresses for
students to write to President Bush .
and members of Congress directly.

The group also uses less subtle
