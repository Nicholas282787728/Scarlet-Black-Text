.Walsh victimized
in parking mix-up

. by Russ Winick

This is a true story,

Patrick Walsh, a tall freshman
known for his exploits on the
basketball court and foosball table,

.sauntered nonchalantly to his
mailbox one morning last October
and found a self— return envelope,
with a hand-written request that he
pay the fines for four counts of
parking violations. Smelling a

.practical—joking rat, Walsh threw
the envelope away. You see, Pat
does not own a car.

WHEN Walsh returned from
Christmas vacation, he found a
citation from the city of Grinnell

.charging him with the same icur
villainous deeds. The fines for
illegally parking his phantom
automobile totaled twelve dollars,
which Walsfi was required to either

.pay by mail, or contest in court,
Realizing now that this was no gag.
a puzzled Walsh decided never—
theless to ignore the citation. “I
wanted to see how far this would

go," he explained.

Five days after his scheduled
court. date passed, Walsh received
a notice from Elsie Minner. a
magistrate from the Iowa District
Court in Montezuma. His failure to
act promptly had cost him an
additional $10.50, Judge Minner
inlormed Walsh. He could now pay
the $2250 by mail, or enter a plea
of “not guilty” in the Magistrate
Court of Grinnell on February 28th,
Failure to comply with either of
these options, Walsh was warned,
would result in the issuance of a
warrant for his arrest. and he
would be prosecuted for both his
failure to appear at the hearing
and contempt of court.

UNDAUNTED, Walsh continued
to treat the matter as an absurdity,
and he wrote a letter to Ms, Minner
explaining why he did not intend to
show up in court. Pat then learned
that, regardless of whether or not
he was guilty on the original

pm, Monday in Roberts Theatre.

Grinnell College Republicans.

That the Panama Canal treaties
should be ratified,

economic and historical aspects of

originally conceived the idea
because “I thought that it would he
a good way to spark debate and
interest.” After receiving a
positive response from Mayer,
Greenberg contacted Turner's
office and the next day Turner
agreed to'debate at Grinnell.

Turner is an outspoken opponent
of ratification of the treaties for
two reasons. He feels that the canal
is United States property which
cannot be given away to a foreign
government through such a treaty.
Turner also believes that by giving
the canal to Panama, the ‘cost of
shipping Iowa grain would in-
crease considerably, and. con-
sequently, damage Iowa’s
economy. _

MOYER, however. disagrees
with Turner on both points, and

'Presidential ballot stuffed

by Bob Mitchell

Upto 113 candidates may appear
on the presidential ballot in
Wednesday’s SGA presidential
election.

A runoff election, which will
undoubtedly be necessary. will be
.held either Friday, March in, or

Monday, March 11!. Balloting for

next Wednesday’s election will be

held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the
post office.
THE open forum for presidential
.candidates, originally scheduled
for March 6, has been rescheduled
for Sunday, March 5, in order to
avoid a conﬂict with the Turner-

Moyel‘ debate on the Panama

Canal
0 The vice presidential elections

are tentatively scheduled for

March is. The open lorum for vice-

presidential candidates is

scheduled for Thursday, March 9,

.at 7 pm. in Younker lounge and 9t

pm. in Loose lounge.

The unwieldy number of
presidential candidates for this
year's elections rﬁulted because a
large number of students took
advantage of dittoed self-
nominations forms. These forms
were passed around the campus by
students Scott Lewis and Russ
Winick. The self-nomination forms
were Lewis’s idea.

KINO Ruth, ch rman of the
five-man SGA election board, said
that the board probably would not
impose an entrance fee or cam-
paign deposit to reduce the number
of names that will appear on the
ballot.

“The nominations are valid, and
there is nothing we can do about
it,” he said.

Ruth commented that the Board
as a body had not considered such.
a measure, but that “individually,
we thought of trying to invalidate
the group nominations,” he said.

Winick said that his motives

were to encourage a more
democratic election.

“WE FELT that it was very
unfortunate that in the past few
years people had to be begged into
running for SGA office. . .We felt
that the essence of democracy is
freedom of choice which is
enhanced by a large number of
viable options. This is the
American way. Anyone who ob-
jects should be reported to the old
House Un»American Activities
Committee.” he said,

Ruth stated that he does not,
foresee the use of any nominating
restrictions in the future.

“Personally, I would hope (that
such a restriction be instituted) but
I doubt it (would be). i pity
whoever will be election board
chairperson next year.“

RUTH feels that the number of
nominations is an indication of
student dissatisfaction with SGA.

adds a third reason in support oi
ratification. He states that the
treaty is a legitimate constitutional
exercise of the preSident’s treaty
making power. He believes that
Turner has greatly exaggerated
the Canal’s impact upon Iowa's
agriculture, since the United
States possesses both an Atlantic
and a Pacific fleet. Today, unlike
the past few decades, the United
States does not rely as heavily
upon the Panama Canal for
shipping purposes, according to
Mayer, ‘

ratification is in America's long
term economic and national
security interests since it will
foster closer ties with Latin
American countries, and at the
same time, “help to remove some
vestiges of ‘Yankee Imr
perialism,’ ”

MDYER feels that the event Will
provide an excellent opportunity
for faculty, students, and towns-
people to see a good debate that
will hopefully encompass all the
relevant points of the treaties. “I
hope that'out of it would come a
better undeistanding of what's at
stake with regard to the Panama
Canal treaties," he stated,

The most important of the two
Panama Canal treaties allows the
United States the right to operate
and take protective measures for

imperialism. ’

Canal will be oveiseen by the
United States until January I, 1990,
after which Panama will take over
its control. In addition, after 1999,
both the United States and Panama
will be allowed to act in defense of
the canal, United Stats ships will
also be accorded special privilege
in passing through the canal in
time of war.

lN ORDER to be ratified, two-
thirds of the Senate must approve
the treaties, However. they may
alter it in any way and still approve
passage. During this process, only
a simple majority of senators is
needed to approve alteration of the
existing form After the Senates
confirmation, the treaty is then
passed on to the President, who
actually ratifies the treaties.
