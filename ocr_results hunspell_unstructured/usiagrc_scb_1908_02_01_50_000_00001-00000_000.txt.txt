THE SCARLET AND BLACK FOR THE SECOND SEMESTER 75 CENTS

IEANDJK CLARK IS DEFEATED.

Grinllcll Wins the First Giulio 0f the
Trill—A Clllstl Fight.

(By Special Correspondent)
The game with Leander Clark Col-

lege was unexpectedly close, (ind hard
taught. The frequent Calling of fouls
however, had l1 tendency to make the
game slow. The absence of Barber
from his pasitlon interfered with Grill-
llEll'S team work, but in the second
hall‘ the team pulled togcthcr and
played good hall. Gl'lnnell took th'l
lead in the ﬁrst few minutes of play
and held it during the ﬁrst half. Le-
ander Clark took a brace at the open-
ing Hi the second half, getting two
ﬁeld goals rapid succession, but
crlunell got together and to the cud

of the game played the best hall they
player] (hiring the game, at all times

having the game Well in hand.

Leander Cl s center was perhaps
the strongest man on their team. Their
team work was good and if they had
been able to throw ﬁeld goals or goals
from fouls, the‘score might have been
diflerent.

Grinnell's team work

in

was rnggcd
at times, but at the critical time in
the last half they pulled together nnd
with Zcigler getting the knock off, won
the game. For Grinncll no single man
starred especially, but all played a
steady, hord some.
