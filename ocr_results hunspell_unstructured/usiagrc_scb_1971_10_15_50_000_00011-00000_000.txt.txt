Washington Correspondence:

Gregory Fast: While War lusts

Walking in the early evening
on a dark and deserted street.
A battered old Mustang slows
and veers toward the curb.
Paranoia. Thoughts flash ,
‘Eut it can’t happen to me'.

For those of sadistic bent,
read no further , it didn't.

Logic prevailed over fear.
Who could possibly want to
rob me of a Roy Rogers beef
burger? There are plenty of
garbage cans in the city of
Washington which one could
tackle and pilfer with much
less hassle , and probably
with better results.

My only other possession of
value (7) at that time beingmy
room key for McDowell Ter-
race (terrace being a polite
term for thebasementaccom-
odations of Me Dowell Hall,
which are roughly comparable
in furnishings and character to
Clark Pit (Zoo). I felt rea-
sonably safe in approaching
the man who motioned from
the open car window (reason-
ably safe meaning approacht
ing, but reg—reting leaving my
Adidas at the dorm).

sincerity

Thus I met Dick Gregory,
last week's feature speakEr 3“
the American University. Ale
though Dick Gregory was in
need of directions in order to
find the AU campus, the AU
student body had no trouble in
locating Gregory. Thousands
turned out to jam not only the
lecture hall where he was
speaking, but also filled ad-
joining lecture halls and
classrooms where the speech
could only be piped in over the
PA. system.

Many of the issues and store
ies were echoes from his
Darby Gym address to Grin—
nell last spring, but there were
many new thoughts as well —
and one could not possibly
question the sincerityand deep
belief that Dick Gregory main~
tained in the ideas he pres
jected.

Pain

”When I lie in bed at night,
the pain racks my body sobad
all I can think about is food.
And 1 say to myself, ‘When the
hunger runs through your body
think about the bombs, think
about the bullets, when you feel
pain, think about the women in
Vietnam going tosleep with the
pain of losing a husband or a
son.‘ "

Dick Gregory has been fastt
ing on a diet offruitjuicesand
water for more than 170 days
now, and he vows to continue
his fast until the war is over.
And in spite of his decimated
physical condition he maint
tains a rigorous speaking
schedule, touring, for the most
part, college mmpuses. He
puts his faith in the youth of
today, repeating the refrain,
"You young people have a big
job ahead of you H and you
don’t have much time."

MaydaY

When speaking about last
year's Mayday demonstra-
tions in Washington, Gregory
noted how often people would
say that the demonstrations
turned some dovish Senators
into hawks. “They didn't end
the war when they were soft,
so iE[ them be hard as
bricks..."

"Mayday was one of the
grandest days in the history of
this country," he continued,
”seven thousand young people
got arrested in one day be-
cause they were trying to
create a situation to make the

government end that war.
That’s a hell of a thing to go
to jail for .if we get enough
people willing to sit in front
of a bridge, we can createa

situation where they won’t
have to sit in front ofa bul-
let."

"Old folks" were a recur-
rent target for Gregory's ridit
cule: “..,in their Brooks
Brothers suits with a red,
white, and blue attache case
with Jesus on one side, and
Agnew on the Other...'Ihere's
no generation 8319, there’s a
moral gap, and the old folks
know it."

Drugs

Gregory came down hard on
drugs. He believes that kids
today have the means to get
together and get something
done, and the guy who gets
completely lost in drugs as a
means of rejecting the estar
blishment is justescaping,not
protesting. “IfthewarinViet-
ham and racism in America
isn't enough to make you high,
no drugs in thiseartharegoing
to help you," he said.

Racism, also, was a topic to
which Gregory devoted a good
deal of attention,but which re
ceived very little of his
comedy treatment. ”America
is the number one racist coun-
try in the history of the
earth..." he said, “andweare
tired of those insult Attica
helped change America. A it):
of niggers went to bed that
night and woke up colored. The
next night they go to bed
colored and wake up black."

Sick and Dying

Gregory sees America today
as sick and dying. We as a
nation make a hero of Lt.
Galley, deny welfare money to
mothers for bread, and "go
around the worldtrying to ram
democracy down peoples'
throats."

“...Young people have a big
job ahead..and you don't have
much time."

Josiah

by Maxine Lowy

Familiar as the name Grint
nell is, most students know
little about the man it repre-
sents.

Josiah Bushnell Grinnellwas
born in New Haven, Vermont
on December 22, 1821; this
December will mark theISUth
anniversary of his birth. -

His family was of Huguenot
origin, and he was proud ofit.
He was raised in a strict rec
ligious atmosphere, where
hard work and moral ideas
disciplined and molded his
outlooks on life. The effects
of growing tip in this house-
hold were reflected in many
incidents throughout his life.

In his autobiography, “Men
and Events of Forty Years",
Grinnell told how his ”first
and last profane oath was
uttered when ten years of

age."...

"I was driving the cows to
pasture..when I struck my toe
against a stone to...bring out
an oath. Horrors! Mother, I
thought, would know it;...and 1
made a resolve which by the
grace of God I have kept ‘-
ncver to use a profane word,
no matter what the tempta-
tion."

Another boyhood incident was

influential in shaping Grin~
nell's ideals. Once, ona bet,

The more you think about it,
the more you have to admire
Nixon and his men. Because
they are good; not in a moral
sense, certainly, but in anoth’
er; they know what they want
and damn it if they are not
running full steam to a touch-
down.

Take China. All ofa sudden,
here's Dicky theanti- Commur
nist walking the water to
Chairman Mao. The public
gasps; Democratic hopefuls
curse loudly behind their
doors and dust about for some-
thing else to use as a paper
issue next year; and in South
east Asia, insurgent nationals
ists curse and maybe weep in
the jungles where they realize
that they may be on the verge
of another betrayal.

Nixon may look dumb, but as
time goes on, I'm forced to
admire him. He wants to get
reelected, sure. And what has
he absolutely gor to do first?
End the war. But Nixon isalso
an American President, and
even his' opportunlsm has cer-
tain bounds.

The United Skates may have
to get out of Viemam, but it
certainly is not going to just
put the boys on troopships and
wave goodbye. Last spring it
looked like the game plan was
long-term investment in air
planes, bombs,andnaval home
bardments. But the cursed
Furies of the American Left
exposed that one. What's a
candidate to do?

Wel‘I-l...Wh0's Public Enr
emy Number (he is Asia? A
toss up between Japan and
China? So, what doyou dowhen
you want a piece of the action
on their turf? Bribe them with
treaties and agreements over
to your sidewo'f’thé fehEe.

Japan is already there. True,
it's been getting a little re—
bellious lately, but Nixon is
using shock therapy and eco-
nomic pressure to bring them
to heel. Bylegitimizing China,
Nixon is in a sense threaten-
ing Japan.

But anyone who believes that
Nixon-twith a battery ofAsian
specialists and investors busy
at his side-has ”inadver;
tantly" angered Japan is out
of his tree. He's provoking
them, making them feela little
outcast, and hoping to evoke a
heavier dependence because of
it.

China, obviously, is the big
question mark. Nixon knows
that China has to be in on any
settlement of SE Asia, and he
wants to get the best settler
ment he can. He is trying to
find out Just how good the best
is.

The real purposebehind Nix-
on's journey is to pander to
what he hopes are genuine
great power ambitions on Chit
na's part. Isuspect that he is
going to offer them a chance to
grow a little greater, invest in
some prestige and power.

Not too much, of course: he
may cautiously hint at a nut
clear Japan not under Ameri‘
ca's thumb, or he may mumble
about the mere existence ofa
UStsupported, expanding Jae
pan. That could go either way.
Regardless, China must cer
tainly reckon with Japan, and
as it stands now, it could be
handy to have the UnitedStates
around to moderate a little.

What Nixon wantsin returnis
a satisfactory stabilization of
SE Asia, with the cooperation
of China and Japan. He will
ceremoniously open a new era
of good feelings, peaceful CO’
existence in Asiawif the Chi-
nese cooperate. A big ”if".

In the past China has loudly
defended and reassured just
about every liberation struge
gle in the world, especially in
Asia. Its public line has been
unstinting support of Iocalna-
tipnalistmovements in 'Asia‘.
Nixon, of course, could not
Nixon, of course, could not
abide by that in the hypothe-
tical future. But Ho Chi Minh
was always afraid of Mao’s
shadow and worked sisadfast’
ly to stay out of it. News of
Nixon’s visit was reportedly
greeted quite glunily in Hanoi,

where leaders fear a Chinese
sellout marketed by Nixon.

This is what Nixon is hoping
to eventually negotiate with
the Chinese: an international
neutralization andanegotiated
disbursement of ”spheres of
influence"t‘alth0ugh no one
will use that term. It is per-
fect--America's “interests‘
are served, albeit at a dis-
count; Dick can get reeelec-
ted as the man who rescued
us from the SE Asian quagmire
through sure-footed diplo~
macy; China will emerge in a
new role, and in a sense
somewhat neutralized; Ja-
pan's enormous energies will
be safely channeled into pre»
scribed areas of Asia.

Most important of all, such
an arrangement wouldprovide
the vehicle for continued
American investment, influ-
ence, and presence in Asia in
a form that would appeal to
most Americans while at the
same time demolishing much
of the Left’s present founda-
tions.

Only Nixont-Or someone like
him-twith sucha sterlingrec“
ord of anti—Communism could
even think ofpullingsomething
like this off and survive poli-
tically. Anyone else would be
howled off the stage for sell—
ing out and profaning the lives
of our men in Vietnam.

China is the crucial link
here. If she does want the
prestige and influence thatany
normal power her size does,
then there is no reason [0 be
lieve that she won't buy. It
really is a good foot in the
door.

China has been a maverick,
a different kind of power, but
recently she has moved on
several diplomatic fronts in a
rather more traditional man—
ner. Her present position re
mains unclear.

So Nixon, the eternal salesr
man, is off to pound a new
beat, knock on a new door.
Whether China will buy this
particular used car is a seri-
ous question.

Would you buy it?

B. GrinneH's Passing'Legacy

he had inhaled fumes from a
cider barrel which made him

violently ill. From that time,
he had a strong dislike for
alcohol. When he sold lots to
settlers of Grinnell, he did so
on condition that if whiskey
were ever sold there, the land
would revert to him. Perhaps
this is why the town attracted
enough retired ministers to
become loiown asSaint's Rest.

Even though his father was a
schoolmaster as wellasa far—
mer, there was little to broad-
en Grinneli’s horizons, be
cause reading material was
scarce. Afterteachinghimself
writing and arithmetic, Grins
nell attended the Allen Classi-
cal School. He found the teach-
ers so easyand the students so
”jovial" that there was little
to encourage study. He with-
drew to teach school, con-
vinced that entertainment and
a practice in speaking was all
he could gain there.

After attending the Auburn
Theological Seminary in 1847,
he became apastor ofthe Cont
gregationai Church. In 1851
he started the First Congret
gational Church in Washing-
ton, D. C. Here he delivered the
first sermon against slavery
ever heard in the city. The
slave owners resolved to drive
out this radical; he was come

pelled to move to New York.

In New York he developed a
hoarseness that forced him
to change his occupation. The
man he happened to ask for
advice was Horace Greeley,
who uttered immortal words in
response: “Go West, Young
Man, Go West." Grinnell
followed this advice.

By 1854 he hatlacquired six
thousand acres in Poweshiek
County and had founded the
town of Grinnell with three
men.

An influential person in the
area, Grinnell attended such
important meetings as the one
to organize the Republimn
Party of Iowa in 1856, and the
1861) convention which nomiv
nated Lincoln for the Presi-
dency.

He was elected state senator
on the platform: "No liquor
shops, free schools for Iowa,
no nationalizing of slavery."
He gained a reputation as
Iowa's leading abolitionist.

A recognized station on the
Underground Railroad, the
Grinnell home was once
visited by John Brown with a
band of escaped slaves. Grins
nell was a U.S. Congressman
from 1863 to 1867. He urged

The Scarlet and Black

the use of black soldiers and
opposed the readmission of
Southern states to the Union
until they gave the vote to
blacks.

Grinnell College, founded in
1859, has come to embody
some of Grinnell’s ideals,
though his cleanliness of
tongie and his temperance
have long since disappeared
from the Grinnell scene.
