Community Chorus gives concert

By Laura Waxman

ThisSunday, April 19at2200 pm,
theGrinnell CommunityChorus will
give lls spring concert in Herrick
Chapel. The longest piece of music
the chorus will perform is Gabriel
Faure’s Requiem.

Unlike the music of other well-
known romantic composers such as
Beethoven,Faure‘s music gathers its
strength from a cool restraint rather
thana thunderousintensity.TheCho»
rus’ conductor John Stuhrr
Rommereimstateduiatwithutelargc
size of the choir, a quiet moment in
the peice can have “a real breath to it
you can’t get with a smaller choir."

Accompanying the chorus for the
Requiem are Barbara Lien on the ore
gan, Catherine Mendelsohn on harp
and Helen Neumann on violin.

The other shorter pieces in the
program are rcprmmativc of a later
time than Faure‘s; however, they
match the Requiem’s theme of death
or loss. These pieces include Three
Motel: for the Season af Lent by
Francis Pouletlc, Set Me a: a Sea! by
W.Walton,andZoriuB'ulbyGyorgii

Svirldov, All three composers are
from roughly the same tlme period of
mid 20th century.

WhileStuhr—Rommereim has con~
ducted some of the shorter pieces
before with theGrinnell Singers,this
will be thefirst time he has conducted
the Faure piece. He Chose the Re7
quiem by popular demand since sev-
eral chorus members had shown an
interest in performing it. Stuhr-
Rommereim went on to say that “part
of the role for me as the conductor,
and for the choir, is to work our way
through major works."

In the past four years that Stuhr»
Rommereim has been conducting the

chorus, they have performed works
such as Beethoven’s Mass in C and
Mozart’s Max: in C Minor. For their
winter concert in 1990, the chonts
was able to perform Handel's Mes~
rialtatthe GrinnellCommunltyCenr
ter.

Altogether the chants consisu of
75 members, including both students
and townspeople. The choms is joined
by the 43 Grinnell Singers also di~
rected by Stuhr~Rommcreim. It has
increased in size and strength during
the four years that Stuhr-Rommeriem
has been conducting it, and it remains
open to all students and members of
the communitv.
