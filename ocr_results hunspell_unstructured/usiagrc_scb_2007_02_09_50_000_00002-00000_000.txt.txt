Earlier this month, Illie
nois Senator Barack Obama
announced he had formed an
exploratory committee
for his candidacy for the
2008 Democratic nOn'il’
nation for President. Obamn is the only African-American
in the senate and only the third since Reconstruction.

New York Senator Hillary Clinton announced that she
had formed an exploratory committee of her own earlier
via an internet video broadcast, becoming the country's first
woman with a good chance at the presidency Both are at-
pectcd to ofﬁcially announce their candidacy in the coming
weeks.

While either candidate would eventually be tested in the
general election against a likely strong Republican opponent,
their popularity among Democrats is signiﬁcant. A recent
I/lezingm Past poll identified the two candidates as the top
contenders for the Democratic nomination.The probability
of either candidate securing the party’s nomination has posi-
tioned the race as potentially one of historic proportions.

In the De: Mimier Regxrzei-‘s most recent Iowa Poll, a ma-
joriry of respondents believed the country was prepared for
either a black or woman president, at 67 and 55 percent re-
spectively.

Symposium,

SEE: How was the deci-
sion made to sentence them
to death?

Bennett: When I was
sworn in as the federal district
court judge,I took an oath to
uphold the Constitution of
the United States. I frequently
have to set aside my own per
sonal feelings and uphold the
law. It was thejury that made

the decision to use the death
penalty, so 1 was duty bound
to impose the death penalty.
Even though In personally
opposed to it,I was able to do
it because of my oath of of-
ticcrI take it very seriously.

secs: How did you feel
when the jury

tence. I was actually staitled
that they did, and kind oftake
en aback. It kind of took my
breath away. But I was very
troubled by it; I remain very
troubled by it. Even though I
entered a ruling athrniing her
death sentence, I said ...that

case, I was not
surprised that
they used the death penalty;
I didn’t really have a moral
problem with it because the
crime was so heinous and his
culpability was so clearly es-
tablished.

In AngelaJohnson’s case,I
did not think thcjurywas got

Johnson got the
death penalty, but
I'm confident she got a very
fair trial. so I feel good about
my rulings, but I'm not real
happy with the results in her
case. But that's not my decie
sion to make. Congress says
it's the jurywho should decide
that. I’m the kind of person

who would lose a lot of sleep
ifI rhought I let myselfdown,
ifI thought I let me country
down, by not providing a
fair trial.

SEE: Do you agree with
the federal government that
we should have the death
penalty in some circumstanc-
es?

Bennett: I’m not con-
vinced that you can have a
system that eliminates the
arbitrary imposition of the
death penalty So, because it
is so extraordinarily difﬁcult
to eliminate the arbitrariness,
l'in opposed to the death
penalty. If you had a system
where you knew that no mat-
ter where that case was tried,
in whatever federal district
court, on these facts any jury
would impose the death pens
alty.

“In general, I think both
race and gender will prob-

voting for either Obama or
Hillary.

[However], 1 don't think
it's the role of voters in the

the views of the American
voters in general, to elect
whichever one is most likely

Not enough hours for Joint Board

By JORDAN KUJALA AND REBECCA CHOHLAS-WDOD

When his senator could not make Joint Board meetings
because of time commitments last year, HaneShin Lin '08
began filling in on Wednesday nights. Because the position
gives senators access to more information than most students
on campus, Lin decided to run for a Senate seat. But after a
term in office, Lin decided he could no longer handle the time
commitment the job required and decided not to seek another
term.

. The responsibilities or the job can provc overwhelming to
many Joint Board participants. Dimculty in balancmg SGA,
academics and personal life discourage inany from pursuing an
SSA position. It may also be the reason for what has been, no
coldlng to Administrative Coordinator Nick Blcncowc ’03, a
recent shortage of SGA senatorial candidates.

Mandatory weekiyjoint Board meetings take roughly threc

hours each VVednesd-ay night, and, according to Lin, the ad-
ditional required committee meetings each take another two to
three hours a week.

For this reason, SGA student candidates typically draw
from a group of active students with leadership experience.
They typically are not involved in athletics or busy with in-
tensive classes due to the perceived time commitment ofJoinr
Board. t

Several senators noted that the time commitment is not
overwhelming. Lindsay Dennis ’08 estimated that she spends
{our to five hours a week on SGA, but fell the time varied based
on cluster and the projects that senators choose.

Some senators exemplify the ability to balance numerous
activities. Loosehead Senator Suzanne Pohvy 'os participates
in swing, Belly Dance, EXCO, the Community Meal, and
community choir. Polivy said she would not have run unless
