SIGMA DELTA CllL
The installation of the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi is the ‘col
nnuaticn or a movement started sev—
eral years ago to raise the sundard
01' college journalism in Gi'lnnell, and
to create more interest among the stile
dents and graduates in newspape
work as a profession. it is the out.
growth of the spirit of enthusiasm for
the Big GGame which has dominated
the stall at the Scarlet and Black tor
and which resnlted in Grinneli
pin g on important part in the or—
gantmncn of the iowa College Press
association. .

newspaper work has heeu a student
inlet..t since the founding of the 0.017
lege. ’ltte scarlet and Black, founded
in losd as. a successor of the Grtnnell
l\'t.‘\\.i Letter, has grown irom :1. LAD)!
sheet appearing once a week, to a
sc.rli»week1y newspaper with the large

. est circulation of any college or und-
versity paper in lowa.

The splendid spirit of unity and good

fellowship which has been character—
istic of the Scarlet and Black staff ior
many years was strengthened in 1913,
when the ﬁrst annual house party was
held at Colfax. It was this meeting
that ﬁrst created lccal enthusiasm for
a state association, and i: was largely
due to ,the cams of Walter Bennett,
{I’ll-editor of that year, that the Iowa
College Press association was organ-
ized at Hotel Colfax a few months
later. . ,
. The ,Iollege curriculum has always
included the liberal subjects that are
so, essential in training for newspaper
work, and, in recent years courses in
news writing. .feature and editorial
writing have been added. These, in
connection with the work of the po-
litical science and economies depart—
ments are making it possible for pros-
pective newspaper men to get valuable
professional training here.

The Grinnell Press Club was formed

.\ cat .-

last year by a group of men aoiive\

in college journalism, and intending.
to make the profession their life
Work.- In order to strengthen the al—
ready warm spirit of fellowship Coma
mon to the newspaper men at Iowa,
Anles and Grinnell, and to ally the
local men with college students thrur
out the country who have similar jour-
nalistic aims, the club petitioned for
a chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, which
was granted during the summer.

The Grihnell chapter, the youngest.
in the fraternity, hopes to prove itself
Worthy of the honor conferred upon
it. The journalistic spirit is the high«
at here now that it has ever been, and
this should be greatly increased dur-
ing the coming years.

It was largely because of the hearty
cooperation or the sigma Delta Chi
men at Iowa and Amos that the chaps
tor was granted here, and one or the
greatest beneﬁts of the new afﬁlia-
tion will he Lhe strengthening of the
relationship between the three institua
tions. These three chapters will be
graduating students each year in in-
creasing numbers, autl in that way
will have a constantly growing inﬂua

ence upon the newspaper profession in -

Iowa and the Middle west.

ROOSEVELT FORGOTTEM

Almost a week has passed now since
Theodore Roosevelt passed ircm ns.‘
Almost a week i and still Grinnell
has offered not the slightest tribute to
his morhm'ytgllat a syllable ivom the
college platform, not a line in the:
Scarlet and Black. While the nine 7‘.
can llag hangs at llalfrmcist 'round the
world, while great cities like Chicago
for a brief period suspend all traffic
to honor his luneral, our little world
ignores his passing. ‘
l Has this been due to carelessness
and stupidity or to a narrow partisan-
ship that thinks thereby to detract
from the praise and honor that is hisl
due? Surely it cannot be partisan-
ship. for partisanship pales into insig-
iiincance in the light of those great
services which he has been llrivlleged
to give this country that welove, Even
his political opponents have not, in
these last few day , grudged him a rust
recognition; w millions have
mourned him as the greatest American
of his generation, if not of all timei
the truest and most courageous up
holder or his country's ideals in those
years which needed sorely hotk truth
and moral courage.

The writer has waited with an
amazement fast deepening into indige
nation for Griuncll's recognitiou. No
matter what may have been the indi
vidual pr Iltlices or any or us. we
must, recognize that it is not fair to the
students who depend upon us, largely,
for their information and 7 unfortu-
natcly 7 often for their opinions, also.
that we should fail to tell them what
Theodore Roosevelt's service to\ his
oonutry has been. Education is not
[mind between the covers of ten rlloolis
merely. The host of it is found rather
in the lives of lilell,~i‘n the inspire
lion of their thoughts and deeds. Few
lives in the world's histo - » have beeu‘
to ﬁlled as Roosevelt's with the duali- ,
ties that inspire. We cannot dishonort
‘his memory hy our silence, but we'
shall, without question impoverish by
.it the minds and hearts of our stod-
.ents. -An instructor.

mamm
i it now seems probable that an Olﬁ-
cers Reserve corps will he established“
in Grinhell, either late this year or
'next year. . .

The R. 0. T. c. shouldnot he hastily
condemned simply because the s. A.
‘T. c,.was an experiment few college
menvwould ,want to have a part in dur-
ing peace times. The R. o. T. C. has
been in operation for many years at
all or .the smte universities and has
,been very popular with the students.
,it ,does not resemble the s. A. T. c.
‘,in the slightest. If the drill is compul-
:sory here (it is at most universities)
lit will probably be for not more, than,
itwo years. And the time given to drill
is usually three or four hours a week,
taking the place of compulsory physi-
cal dr l.

Military affairs will have as import—
;ant a place in the curriculum as emo—
‘uolnics, or French or any other study,
but no more important.

Of course, in an R. o. T. (1., military
‘discipline does not extend outside of
drill hours. There is no "can’t get
’em up in the morning" or “super-
vised" study: Uniforms of course are,
worn on drill days only. .

The advantages of real military drill
are excellent, and the work itself can
he made enjoyable. A man is playing
his par as a good citizen in a very
substantial way if he takes the two
years work and then accepts a com-
mission in the reserve corps to be
ready to play his part from the ﬁrst
it America is ever forced into another
war. —Dnn Clark, '13,
