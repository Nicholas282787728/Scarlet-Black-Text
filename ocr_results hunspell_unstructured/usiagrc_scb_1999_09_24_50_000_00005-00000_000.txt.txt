So, we guess that we should
apologize for the confusion rhar we
caused over rhe movie days lass
weekend. I guess we're not as
psychic as we thougl‘lta So, maybe
your boyfriend isnr chearing on
you. We‘re not getting $3.99 a
minute, so we don't care if we
screw up your plans. As for rhis
weekend, we’ve got two more top-
norch films. But ifyou go on the
wrong day, you mighr be highly
disappoinred. Do you want to
believe us or not? You make rhe
call.

Ten Things 1 Hate Abaiit You
(Friday, Sept 24 @ Harris e, 7:30
pm) Stars that kid from 3rd
Rock from the Sun (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt), Julia Stiles,
Heath Ledger, and some other
punks.

C: The rirle of this movie alone
should tell you rhar this is the
movie for me.

A: In fact, I think Courtney has
acrual lists about rhe things she
hates about you.

C: so true. Supposedly this movie
is “loosely" based on Shakespeare's
T17: ﬁrming after Shrew. Yeaheif
loosely means nor at all. The only
way they're relarcd is rhacrhe rirles
rhyme. Oh, they also named rhe
high school Padua High School
and one guy's last name is Verona.
Don't stretch it too much, you
mighr pull a groin.

A: Apparently, [he
moneymakers in Hollywood are
rip-offs of The Bree/afar; Ciao
based on BillyS. Fortunately, this
trend makes me too happy for
words. God help me, I love these
movies. They are so Szi/rnluri
magazine.

c: I actually really like these
movies also. 1 think I am regressing

more the closer I get to graduating.
Let me just rake this opportunity
to say shar the Australian guy in
this movie is a liortie. I'm gonna
bring a cup next rime for all the
drool.

A: The basic plot is a popular girl
can't dare unless her mean sister
dares. So, some real geniuses set up
the bitchy girl with a guy they can
pay (Courtney’s aforementioned
horrie) just to get into the popular
girl's panrs.

C: So, let’s think about this The
meanie and home like each other,
she finds out that hewas paid, yada
yada yada, the end. Personally, I
think that she mean girl is way
bester looking than the “popular”
little sister. Plus, her prom dress is
way classier. I also think that the
model guy has on way too much
make—up throughout rhc whole
thing.

A: Watch for cameos by great
bands like Letters so Cleo and save
Ferris. This is a soundtrack movie,
bur at least it's not the normal
Puffy songs and shitty remakes of
classic ‘80: runes.

Courtney's Beer Scale:

Again, quality reflection; I rhink
twice, bur it might have been three
times. They all run together.

Tango (Saturday, Sept. 25 @
Harris—7:30) Stars -— what stars?
A: Has anyone heard or this one?
c: You know pickings are slim
when the films chair acrually says
rhis is “a foreign film you probably
won’t find as Videoland.” Need we
say more.7

French House Film: Wages of Fear

By Joseph Grim Feinberg
Sloif Columnist

7:30 pm. Monday Sept, 27 @ French
House (1130 East St.)

Would you drive an old truck filed
with nitroglycerin: over 300 miles of
bad roads, knowing that a slight bump
or the ovcrhcating ofrlie engine could
cause a catastrophic explosion? Would

’you do it if you were offered $2000

trhar's 52000 iusrafrer World Warll)?
Would you do it ifyou were stuck in a
dying oil town in the cenrral
American wilderness, from which
otherwise you could never make
enough money to cscapc?Thcsc are the
questions which face rhe lead
characters or Wages amer. Their
unwavering answer is yes.

This film by Henri Georges
Clouzot explores eosrenrial and social
questions as is shows characters
reacting so extreme siruarions_
errreme exploitation,
challenges, extreme fear. Though ir
stairs off with a rarher slow ser up of
the siruarion and introduction of thc
characters, she Iilm gradually builds
suspense, slowly reaching our and
raking hold oius, not letting go until
rhe inrense final frames Then we drop
back inro our seats, rake a few deep
breaths and try to sort our what
happened, and whar irall means.

Ar rhe beginningofrhe film, Mario,
Jo, Luigi, and Bimha find themselves
srranded in what has become a colony
of vagabonds and displaced people,
including Frenchmen, Italiansr
Germans, and North Americans, in
addition to rhc Latin American
mmizo: and indigenous peoples.This
sort of prologue to rhe principle story
of the film is filled wish images and
characterization that later on will gain
significance. It is perhaps too long for
many anxrous viewers, but is is
interesting in irselffor what it shows
about the social situation caused by
this infilrrarion of United Srares capital
inroadevelopmgnarionTothosewho

extreme

know something about the realities of
Central America, many details orilns
part of the film will seem rather
artificial, bur the idea is accurare.
Taken as a Stylized version ofwhar may
have existed, it can show us some
rhoughopiovoking things

The main part of the srory begins
when the Southcrn Oil company hires
the main characters so transport
nirroglycerine from the town to an oil
well. Now the drama unfolds as
countless complications arise during
the voyage. There are times when we
foresecwhar will happen next, and the
film fails ro make us feel rhe suspense
rhas it intends to develop, There are
other rimcs, hchver, when we sir on
rhe proverbial edges ofour seats. The
characters somesimcs seem flat, bur at
other rimcs they gain our sympathy
and imagination. And from the
beginning to the end, the film’s
important themes remain at the back
of our heads, adding deprh m the
emotion that rhe story makes us feel.

Wigzl' amer, like most interesting
works ofarr, provokes more questions
rhan it answers. it pushes us to tlllnlt
abous rhe modern world: social order,
in which a Norrh American oil firm
can rake people from the rest of she
planer and move rhem around like
pawns on a chess board. It muses on
rheideaofhow racing grearehallenges
can give meaning to people's lives, or
can send shem inro despair. it asks
what it means to exist in rhe face of
imminenr death.

Ar the Cannes Film Festival in
I952, Wager l7mei' won the awards of
Besr Film and BesrAcror. I’n-i norsurc
ifl would have given it rhar same
honor (I don't know what eompernion
it had), bus I would say that rhe
thought behind it is powerful enough
ro overcome any of irs stylistic
imperfections, is is eersainly worth a
rrip ro rhe French House to watch this
him. Always a good way to begin your
week—questioningyourcxistcnccand
cririciaing rhe world order,

Alumna Performs Latin American Folk Music

By Eric Gable
Sloff Writer

Sunday afternoon brought
Grinnell college graduate and lowa
musician Karin Stein back to the
Scbring—Lcwis Recital Hall for
almost two hours ofSouth American
folk music. Stein pcrfotmcd with her
group, La Negra Karin y Los
Llaneros, playing a wide variety of
folk songs from cosra Rica,
Colombia, Paraguay, and other
Latin American countrics. The
word “llanctos” in rhe group’s name
refers [O the savannas of South
America

The group opened with a piece
called “Concert ofth: Savannas” by
Venezuelan composer Juan Vicente
Torrealba. The band also played
songs fromavariery oforher genres,
including “worksongsg‘ which are
improvised by people going about
rheir daily chores, and Llancros
anthems such as “Soul of the
Llanos."

Stein and the other members of
her trio, Henry Benavides and Juan
Carlos Gene, formed rhe group in
1978 in Costa Rica. All thrc: had
moved there from South America
within the previous five years. Stein
hctsclfis a native ofColombia.

on Sunday evening, the
ensemble held an informal
workshop, inviting interested
students and community members
to ask questions, ralk ro the
performers, and try playingsome of
the instruments.

The group played a number of
insrrumenrs during their act. The
harp is one of rhese. Henry
Bcnavides has won a number of
prizes as folk festivals for his
expertise on the traditional Llanero
harp; on sunday, the ensemble used
primarily a Paraguayan folk harp,
but also integrated a concert harp
and a Celtic harp into the
performance,

Other Instruments include the
cuarro, a foutrstringcd strumming
instrument from South America; the
capachos, which are maracas ﬁlled
with capacho seed; and she guitarrar
a Spanish guitar which is probably
rhe widely—used folk
instrument in Latin America,

l.a Negra l<ann y Los Llaneros
were joined on Sunday by guest
artists EdgarEast,]:annic Chcncttc,
Claire Chencttc, Maya Andelson,
and a 32-piece children’s choir.

Karin stein is not only a

most

performer, bur also a composer, she
reccnrly wrote the musical score for
“Soldiers of Peace # a Children’s
Crusade," pair of CNN’s
Perspecrives series. The
documentary profiles a group or
young people in Colombia,
nominated for rhe Nobel Peace Prize
two years in a row, who are working
to bring about peace in rheir
country. CNN will broadcasr the
documentary on Sunday, sepr. 26,
at 8 pm.

Stein, who is formally trained as
a horriculrurisr, graduated from
Grinnell in 1934. Her voice has
drawn praise from many people,
perhaps the most notable ofwhom
is Dr. Oscar Arias Sanchez, rhe
former president ofCosta Rica. ”I’d
like norhing berrer than to make her
a citizen of this country, just to claim
that voice as ours,” he reportedly
said.

When she is not rraveling wirh
rhe ensemble, srein performs as a
soloist and gives lectures at colleges.

Stein lives in Kellogg, IA, with
her husband, Jonathan Andelson, a
Grinnell anthropology professor.

Milin, Cont. from p.4

same, What difference does it
make to me what the reasons are
for the world not wanting to give
me what is mine by right of birth
and talent? The world calmly gives
it. . . to a businessman here and to
Party oﬁicials there. And there's no
place for me, What is this, world?
You motherfucker, Well, I’m
waiting and waiting, but I‘ll get fed
up.”

In an interview for a Russian
magazine in 1990, when asked if
he still hates the American way of
life as at the time he wrote Edit/1k“,
Limonov answered, “Hate isn’t the
right word. 1 just understand
clearly that Westem civilization is
created for the aveiage man, a
completely uninteresting man. It is
inimiczll to Creative people."And I
would agree,

Limonov succeeds in subverting
literary canon on every level:
moral, political, cultural, and
linguistic. And yet, he is at heart
an “oldiashioncd” romantic, with
his conceptions of undying love
and friendship. Behind the nihilist
and the sexual adventurer is the
tender and vulnerable Edik
Limonov who believes that love is
the most important thing in the
world.
