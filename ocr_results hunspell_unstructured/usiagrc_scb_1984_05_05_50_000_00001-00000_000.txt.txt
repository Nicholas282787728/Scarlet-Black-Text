Referendum to decide future
SGA procedure

Today in the Campus Mail room
the future actions 01 SGA concern-
ing national and international
issues will be decided by thestu-
dent body on a reiercndum which
states: "The official SGA opinion

tional or international relavenee)

come of the referendum. the SGA
shall act on the outcome as it
deems appropriate.“

that as “propaganda." Sckalor
Clarified that statement by saying
that it was propaganda in the
same sense in which any advertis-
ing is propaganda — that it con-
tained a bias inherent in the tact
that the makers ol the poster ex
plained and interpreted the issue
to some extent.

Stephen Meehan. member of the
Committee on Student Politics.
agreed, “The poster in Loose Hall
looks like an advertisement for
those in favor of the passage of the
referendum. There was no written
reterence on the poster linking it
to the Student Government
Association." he said.

Marcus and McLean. who
together with Dibble President
Mickey Munley wrote the resolu-
tion in its final lorm, made the
posters themselves. Joint Board
had allocated titteen dollars last
