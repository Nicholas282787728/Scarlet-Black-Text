To die editor:

This Ierrer concerns Jusrln Hoesr‘s Ieirer
ro rhe ediror in lasr week's paper concerning
rhe rally abour rape awareness. His lerrer dis-
eiissed a speeiﬁe case, which, ironically, was
rhe ﬁrsr elear menrion made ro an aeriial case.
concerning our use of rho rerm “rapiss.” we
wanr ro reirerare rhar eonhdenrialieywas mam-
rained. Conirary io iusrins lerrei, we also never
menrioned rhe “legal srarus" orany “specirie
individual,"

However, more imporranrly wed like ro
respond ro iusrin's and urhcrs’ general porrieyel
of rhe rally. Ir is eoneerning ro us mar a few
individuals have charaererired rhe iallyas lack.
inginsubsranee. However, aerual information
abour college violarions or handbook policy
was presenred. Ir is inreresring rhar people have
eonraered us concerning die word “rapist," bur
no one has eonraered us concerning die out»
rageous violarions or school policy. In addi-
iion, ir can reasonably be argued rhar rapisrs
have and ran be aequirred when rhe eollege
does nor properly fallow irs own polieies.

Given rliar we are a school rhar believes in
rhehindamenialsorseligovernancewewould
Lhink rhar rhe issues broughr forrh ar rhe rally
would eoneem each one oryou as a member
of the communiry. The purpose of rhe rally
was to eduoare me eommuniryabour dais prob-
lem (which meadminisrranon fully recognizes,
as ir has already formcd a sexual assaulr rask
Force ro invesrigare rlae manor), eneourage edu—
carion on marrers oi rape on campus, and
srimulare a dialogue berween rhe adminisrra-
[ion and srudenrs on me marrcr.

we have a righr ro arrend a school which
follows irs policies, and ifir doesn’r, we have a
riglir ro proresr mose failures and raise com-
muniry amreness abour rhe problem. We feel
rhar rlie rally was a success: rhe college com»
munizy is now ralking abour sexual assaulr,
whieh is inherenrly she ﬁrst srep (awards

To rhe cdiror:

Iraq once had one ofihc lowesr inhnnmoe
raliry rares in rhe world. irs heal rh rare sysiern
was ihe envy orrhe Middle East, and irs lir.
eraey rare was high. But rhe erreers orrhe Gulf
war and eonrinued economic sanerions have
dcvasratcd rlie popularion and infrastructure
ofrhc eounrry. UNICEF and rheworld Healili
Orgaoieaiion (WHO) reporr rhar over a mil.
lion people, mosrly ehildren and rhe elderly,
have died from eaneer and disease in rhe nine
years since rhe war.

A number oiAmericans have visired Iraq
and seen rirsrhand me srunred children and
desperare populaee, and die pain orpeopleivho
have less loved ones or been murilared by us
hombings. Hospirals laek rhe baresr essenrials
sneh as painkillers, srerile bandages and clean
warer.

The U5 and brirain parrol no-ﬂy zones
which have nor been approved by rhe UN. Iraqi
defenses ineireerually bur deﬁanrly ﬁre back
in proresr, only drawing more ﬁre. Imagine
whar rhe us would do irroreign war planes
were regularly bombing us and violaring our
air spaee.

us milirary planners have fanned a war
hysreria based on rears oflmq when in her ii is
a eounrry crippled by UN/US imposed eco»
nomie Warfare and previous bombardmenrs.

us sanerions are really iusr holding rhe Iraqi
people in our snuggle wirh meir governmenr,
ourdesire ro have some eonrrol over oil in rhe

people say rhar rhis is all Saddam Hiisseiiis
