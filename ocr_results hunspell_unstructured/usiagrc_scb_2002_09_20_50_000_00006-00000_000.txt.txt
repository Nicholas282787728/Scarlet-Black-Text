A Rush of Blood to the
Head by Coldplay

by Bradley Iverson-Long
Staff Writer

You probably know Coldplay'sinieerious single ”Yellow," oiriheir
2000 debur album, Pdmrhulrs. lr had rhe requisire hir single ingredi-
ems: simple lyrics, solid guirar lines. and unique vomls, sung by from
man Chris Martin. While there were a few other grait tracks on
Pompom. all rhc sullen “vocals and guitar" songs blended rogerher
poorly.

Thcir new album A Riot: afBlacd ID in: Hm! quickly sharrers
that sedated mold. The opening of “Politik,” the ﬁrst track, sounds
like it has more drums, dished out by Will Champion, than all of
Pmrbutrr. These songs are much more rhythmic and percussive, yer
rerain rhe group's melodic prowess.

Coldplay srill relies on Martin’s sincere, wallowing voice ro ser
rhem aparr. The lyrirs occasionally reereron middle school angsranri
hurtbmk, like "Nobody said it was easy/ Oh it’s such a shame for us
ro parr/ Nobody said it was easy/ No one ever said that ir would be
this hard," the chorus of "The Scientist." However. when Martin
sings, rhese words reel poignanr and original.

The sryle ofprirwnwo docsn'r vanish compierely. Coldplay's music
is srill better suired ro long nighis ar rhe Forum man a Harris parry.
The ﬁrst single, “in My Piacc," wirh soaring guirar riffs by John
Bucklancl and Martin’s sad shouting, is the closest song to "Yellow."

Marrin says that Coldplay wanrs ro prove “that you can rry ro be
utcliy wirhour being slick, poppy without being pop, and uplirring
wirhour being pompous." Wirh a more complerc blend orrrs players
on this album, the band definircly reaches irs goals.

White Blood Cells
by The White Stripes

by Christine Hancock
Staff Writer

By the time lack Whires send-paper voice surfaces {mm a sonic
srew ro snnounce, “Every brearh rhor is in your lungs/is a rlny iirde
gifr so me," rhe Whire Srripcs’ laresr album, “Whirc Blood Coils,"
has been playing less rhan rwo minutes,

And alrsady, it seems near-porrecr.

Raw and rambuncrious, the rhird efforr from the Derroir-basecl
group is a critic's darling—and righdully so. Whire and ambiguously-
rclared parrner Mcg Whire bring us music rhar will rarrle our win-
dows nndour consciousness. With well-knowing smitks, rhe Whitu
are pleased ro illusrrarc rhar music an be infecrious wlrliour being
insipid; diar simpliciry can ooexisr wnh gut.

The White Stripes revel in the contradictions they create. Their
self-imposed red and whire dress code recreares rhe simplieiry orpcp-
perminrs, innocence and childhood. And in manyways, dieir “White
Blood Cells" is an invigoiaring journey rhough minimalisr music.
Frill-{roe songs pulse or rheir own accord. buoyed by Jack’s aching
gurrar and Meg's schizoid drums, Bur Jack’s vocals add a complex
layer ro rhe mix. He is ar once pleading and demanding, disparaging
and encouraging.

While she skeloron ofsounds on “Whire Blood Cells” is primi-
live and bare, rhe lyrics never shy nwuy from complor issues. With
his raucous howl. White commenrs on life. loss and love. The resulr
is an album bursring wirh both inrriguing emorion and sound.

Gorgeously sparse and painfully mrehy, ”White Blood Cells" is
an inrerise 40 minuros, :lmys over roc soon. Think oriras rheWhires’
riny lirrle girr ro us.
