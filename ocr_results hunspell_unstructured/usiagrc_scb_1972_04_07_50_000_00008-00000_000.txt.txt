Marks Fall As Pioneers lose

There are always a iew bright
spots in the worst deleats. Even
though the Grinnell Joggers took an
32 to 44 whipping irom the Central
track squad, Chuck McGrath came
through with iiliothel‘ brilliant perr
Inrmance in the tWOrmilC to finally
take the school record in the event
that has stood since 1932. That
year, Mike Pilhi‘ow went to the Na-
tioiial'Colngiate track meet [or
Grinnell and won the twormile
against the best tworrnilers in the
Country (this was heiore the Small
College Nationals were created).
His time was 922.8 This record
has stood the assaults of quite a few
orinnell runners only to fall alter
thirty years to MC Grath's winning

time, 9:22.1. Chuck ran the new
record without the henent oi any
competition for pace running alone
against the clock after he lapped
the second-place runner. ‘

in the poie vault, Chris Madson
broke the field house record 0(13’6”
set by Toni Jenkens oi Warthurg
earlier this year. Madson Went
l4’-1/4" on his second attempt.

.. The rest 01 the field events went

well {or Grinnell with Pete Meserve
winning the high Jump, and Dave
Wright taking the long jump and
triple jump. Unfortunately, asevere
case or anemia in the sprints and
relays proved latal, in spite hi the
record periormances Besides the
two»mi1e, we won only one running

Buseballers
Open Season

Couch Ray Boyd emphasized
earlier this Week that despite ineXr
perience this year's baseball team
will be much improved over last
year's (one win) squad. The Pioneers
are scheduled to play tough Moli-
mouth and Knox in away doubleheadr
ers today and tomorrow, so the
coach should soon have some indie
cation oi how coricct his prediction
is.

A glance at the roster reveals the
inexperience that Boyd mentioned:
only one senior, two yuniors, and
{our sophomores are leit from last
year's team.

The Iourthryear head baseball
coach also said that the team Could
badly use more pitching. This year's
schedule calls ior each club in the
southern division of the Midwest
Conference to play back to back
doublelieaders virtually every week~
end ol ttle season. Consequently,
pitching may have even aoigger part
than usual in determining which
teams Will be successful this year.
The members of the team and their
tentative positions are as lollows:
Iniieldei‘s ~r Jeti Dick, Mark
Hanisch, Marty Iker, Bill Johnson,
and John Videtich,

Duttieldei‘s is George “Blake"
Blakesley, Don Bognanno, Bob Doner

event, the halt-mile where John
Hessburg broke the tape and Dan
Hildebrand finished third. That
ain't the way to win a track meet.
The team missed the presence of
key personnel like Harry unit in the
shot put, Jon Gray in the hurdles,‘
and Phil Morales in the hali»mile
and the quarter.

Our next chance lor revenge is on
Saturday at the Cornell Relays Where
we should do fairly well, if the whole
team can make the trip in addition
to our indoor strengths, we will have
Bill Dicks in the javelln, Scott
Stuart in the discus, and Jim Pirolli
in the sweetheart event, the 440
intermediate hurdles

Senior), Arnie Peters, and Bill War-

Pitchers -- Tom Granmali, Chip
Hall, Mike Levy, Mike Siegel, and
Paul siemers;

Catchers -- Wes l-"uyii and Steve
Varys.

The above categories wereincluded
mostly for convenience; many play—

position

II THE HEART

T

We offer a developmental alternative in undergra»
graduate education for those who want to affect the
structure and priorities of our society.

Programs in the arts, communications, video,urban
studies, social sciences, mental health, community

development,

education, basic human problems,

political sciences, law, environmental science, etc.

On sliding scale tuition enables students to attend
who might otherwise be unable to afford a quality

education.

A concurrent work/study program helps students find
meaningful jobs to support themselves and comple-
ment course work and individual and groupprojects.

We feel that college and universities must respond
[0 the needs of the communities that surround them
and not just to their own needs.

Our campus is located in three areas; Washington,

Columbia and Baltimore.

We are now considering applicants for Summer and

Fall, 1972.
