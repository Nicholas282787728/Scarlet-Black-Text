To the Editor:

For the second time this year,
l'vebeen dismayed and disappointed
with my professors. Will they meti-
tion it? I wondered as I sat down in
each of my three classes on Wednesr
day. By 1:15 Irealizcd thatagain,my
professors were gomg to avoid men-
tioning that anything had happened,
that someone at Grinnell was here
one day and not the next. That some-
one had died.

At Grinnell, you don’t need to
know someone to be affected by their
absence. You don’tneed to ever have
talked to someone to know more than
you want to about their personal life
either, and you can be assured that
pcopleknow aboutyours.That‘swhat
makes Grinnell suffocating at times,
butexactly what should make it sup-
portive and unique at other times.

This supportive environment is
undermined when professors don’t
acknowledge the close ties between
student life and academics at Grin-
ncll. We are students, but we are
people first. and perhaps the reluc-
tancetobecomeinvolvedin students’
lives demonstrated by my professors
is partially what leads students to feel
uncarcd for.

Irccognizcthchesitancytomcnn
tion a suicide in [car of inducing a
copycat effect, but there is a differ-
ence between gloiifying and merely
acknowledging that something has
happened. I do not think that my
professor wasjusttfied this fall when
he discussed murder in a Friday class
after the announcement about
Tammy,and then demanded to know
why we weren't talking. I thought it
was fairly obvious. Ignoring bad
things, unfortunately, does not make
them go away or make them easier to
deal with. All that was really needed
from my professors in either situa
tion was a sentence or two expressing
his or her condolences. For the sec-
ond time this year, only one of my
four professors has mentioned the
death of either Tammy or Amelia,
and it was the same professor both
semesters.

1 know there is more than one
professor out there willing to cross
ihaibridge between personal and aca
demic lives. On the whole, I believe
the professors, faculty, and staff at
Grinnell are caring and concerned,
intelligentpcople,butthcir hesitancy
to “get too personal" in this type of
sttutttionstrikes measinscnsitiveand
negligent to the feelings of the stu7
dents of Grinnell.

To the Editor:

Concerning Mr. Washburn's
Column "Common Sense" in last
week's Scarlet & Black; Mr.
Washbum’s logic isseriously flawed.
He repeatedly compared racially
motivated hate crimes to general sta-
tistics ofviolentcrimc which may be

related to, but are not necessarily
motivated by the respective races of
those involved.

Ipropose thatWashbum'sstatisr
tics of inter—racial rape were included
for theiremotional contentas a scare-
crow issue: out of context and with
no regard to other economic and so-
cialfactors affectingthem.lpresutne
(as he did not state) that the cases he
referred to were convxctcd cases of
rape. Black women, it cannot be
denied,arestillatan economic disad-
vantage, as well as in the judicial
system, in reporting and convicting a
white man of rape. White women
have the opposite advantage with re-
gard to black males.

Black women have never been
as universal a sex symbol in the U.S..
Instead they bear a strong, dominat-
ingimage whichmayintimidate men,
and make a black woman a 1ch vi-
able victtm in their eyes. Histori-
cally, black men have married white
women up to ten times as often as
white men have married black
women,according to figures cited in
Black and White Mixed Marriages.

Missing in Washbum’s statcr
mens were the corollary smtistics
regarding whitcrapeofwhitewomen
and blackmpcofblackwomensimi
larly he neatly sidesteps any depth by
comparing the number of racist vio-
lent crimes against blacks to the total
number of violent crimes committed
by blacks against whites.

Youngblackmen arektllingeach
other far faster than they are killling
white men. The motivation for these
deaths is economic and not racial.

Rapeand murderare violentacts
whichcannotbecondonedorignored
by the media, I agree. But Mr.
Washbum’s choice of statistics only
reflectshis“wearebeing attachedby
them" mentality and weakens what
little true logic there is in his article.
I hope, Mr. Editor, that in the future
you will encourage him to stick to
information relevantto hisargument.

To the Editor:

In regard to Mike Washbum’s
“Common Sense" editorial in the
February 5th issue of the 5&8, I
would like to point out that Mr.
Washbum has defeated his own purr
pose. While it is an unfortunate fact
that racial violence occurs all to often
in this country (the color of the
victim's skin is irrelevant) I would
argue that by highlighting instances
of utter savagery, for which racism is
most likely not thc root cause (i.e. the
assault on two girls on a Chicago
bus), does not bring us any closer to
eliminating the cause ofractsm from
our society. I see evidence to support
Mr.Washbum’sthatdcspiscs“racial
hypocrisy,” but only that hc desires

Arthur Ashe: Death of a Hero

IS death was expected but not this soon. The
H former tennis giant was suddenly looking frail

and weak. His pain was even aggravated by
the media, which compelled him to make an emotional
public admission of his disease. Amid all that, he never
gave up but continued his work as a public crusader
against mcism, AIDS and other social ills. But the
reality ofthe dreadful disease soon caught up with him.
Ashe finally succumbed to AIDS in New York on
Saturday, February 6. HIV has claimed yet another
victim~a celebrity.

Arthur Ashe made headlines as the first Black to
win the Wimbledon, beating the
then indomitabch immy Connors
in the 1975 finalsAshe's victory
was especially significant for this
reason: iiwasthe story of a Black
man who broke new ground into
a hitherto whiteman’s sport. The
expensive logistics oftennis creates an artificial barrier
for Blacks and the poor. So before Arthur Ashe, Blacks
wereunknown in tennis.His victory symbolisedabreak-
through and a morale booster for young Blacks to take
to tennis. It did not take long for stars like Zina Garrison
and Mark Mathabane to follow in his footsteps.

A drinker as he was, Ashe soon understood that his
mumph on the court had chronicled him to a leadership
role that transcended athlctics to politics and civil
rights. He led many demonsuations against aparthirx‘l
that finally won over the US. Congress to impose
punitive sanctions against the evil regime of Pretoria.
He organised tennis clinics in the ghettos ofHarlem for
indigent Black kids who could never dream of playing
tennis. And in his last years, he championed the cause of

HIV victims by helping to educate the public on the
reality of AIDS; he disuadcd discrimination against
HIV victims.

These accomplishments are undoubtedly remarks
able, but the man himself was even more impressive.
Growing up in segregationist Virginia, he was initially
refused membership in white tennis clubs. Hispatiencc
and tolerance helped him through these trying and
frustrating moments. It was this same courage and
composure that can-led him through the Wimbledon
finals—his opponent was overwhelmingly favored to
win. Softrspoken but eloquent, he never shied away
from modesty and humility. He always played down
his remarkable achievements on the court, but pi'OA

the upliftinent

By Papa Owusu of the down-

trodden. His

good-manner-

liness won him the admiration of many. Yet he main»

iained his independence of mind, and would not cave

in to fear ofalienating people. That is why in spite of

the sharp criticisms from many prominent Blacks, he

voiced his support for NCAA proposition 42 which

would require high academic standards from college
athletes.

Ashe died at age 497still fairly young. He would
be remembered as the quintessential celebrity who put
humanity first, and himself last. He would be remem-
bered as the man whose persistent campaign against
aparthied has sent that evil system crumbling. And he
would be remembered as crusader for HIV victims and
a Black pioneer in tennis. He was a living incarnate to
what courage can accomplish. He was a good man!

 

 

 

Don’t Wait to be a Victim

is a safe assumption that every Grinnell student,
despite the insulating luxuries of college life which we

I enjoy, is aware of the threats which exist out in the
“real world." We have all seen the crime statistics, we
have all heard the horror stories, we can all understand
how sometimes a person can wind up all alone and in
danger. It is a fact of life that we are all not equally
equipped physically to deal with danger. It is light ofthe
twin realities of danger and human nature that l wish to
propose an idea. When you hear this idea, put aside your
political ideology and yourassumptions, and hear me out.
This is a concept too important to be lost in political
bickering.

i believe that every person
has,as abasic human right, aright
to sclfndefcnse. It isaright which
one is not capable of surrendering
to the government. With the kind ’
of reactive (as opposed to
proactive) policing which we have
in America, it is unreasonable to expect that the poltcecan
protect us all the time. I also understand that a right is
meaningless ifonc isdcntexl the opponunity to exercise it.
Unfortunately, part of human nature is that we cannot
dcfend ourselves equally. Many, if not most, men and
women are lacking the ability to defend themselves
against the threats which present themselves, and there-
fore are forced to turn to technology for protection. One
of my favorite sayings is, “God may not have made man
and woman equal, but Smith and Wesson did," I believe
that we need to recognize the need that persons have for
self-protection and structure our laws accordingly.

This is not a new idea in America. Firearm owner
ship is an integial part of American history. It is a nght
which we inherit from English common law and find in

our Constitution. I realize that this meaning of the
Second Amendment is often debated, butaside from the
considerable legal justification for it, it can be justified
withabitofcommon sense. iftheCourtis to interpret the
Constitution to make choosing an abortion a fundamen»
ial right, then wewsiate thatfirearm ownership hasat
163A the same standing. Abortion rights are based on a
longsericsofactivistdccisions,each moreremovedfrom
the framers intent than the last, firearm ownership is
expressly stated in the Federal Constitution. Gun rights
are totally consistent with the way in which the Bill of
Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment have been inter—
preted. To argue otherwise would be to make the
Constitution 3 bauble, merely apolitical statement when
it clearly is much more.

I believe that we need a na-
tional Concealed-Carry of a
Weapon (CCW) law, A law
basedon Florida’s CCW, which
has been proven empirically to
prevent crime. The law allows
responsible citizens to carry a
f trearm for their protection. To date nearly 125,000
permits have been applied for. The state has only had to
deny 777 of those permit applications. Criminals, as a
mlc, don’tgotoasioreio buy agun,thcy getoneillegally,
Ofall the permits issued, only ﬁfteen have been revoked
forgunrclated crimes. 'I'hatisonly 0.012%0fallpermits.
A CCW law does not cause crime, it gives citizens the
means to prevent it. A criminal will carry a gun regard-
less of what the law says, because criminals, by defini-
tion,do notobcy the law. ACCW stmplygiveseveryone
else the means to avoid becoming victims. How can
persons achieve equality, live full lives, and maximize
their opportunities if they are in fear for their safety? No
onedeservestobeavictim,evcry one deserves toprevent
becoming one.
