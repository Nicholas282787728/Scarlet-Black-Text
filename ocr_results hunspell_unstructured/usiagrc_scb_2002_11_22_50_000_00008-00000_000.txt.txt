Alicc‘ has been hospitalized due to depression once while
at Gtinncll, during the spring or her sophomore yeah “I had
reached a real low point and was ccrivcly considering sui—
cide," shesaid. “I had plans and backup plans olways I would
cry to do k."

Allce ﬁnally talked to someone, and said she should have
been hospitalized that night “[Bur] I convinced [StudentAfr
Fairs] I would be 51th until morning," she said, and instead
took n “leisurely rnp" [o rbc Mercy Franklin Ccnrcr in Des
Memes the next morning

"orcoursc l rricd several orhc. [self-harming] things he
folc rhc morning," Alice said. “I was just lying [about being
safe]. I . I needed to be in the hosplrnl, no doubt, burl shouldn't
have warring until rho morning. It wasn’t appropriate,

“once I made it rhrough rhc night, I was ﬁne cnough
not to go to the hospital," she said. “Ir
was a stupid way to handle the situation."

After leaving the hospiral, there was
no follow-up, Aliccsaid, “I wrs baslmlly
iusr droppcd on at my room, and that
was it. There was no ml support, [and]
it was a big adj urrmcnr, 1 fair rcnlly abdn»
cloned and alone."

Additionally, all her prolcxsors know
she had been hospirnliud, Alice said, “[And] they knew I
wasnt physically ill. It was bad."

SmdenrAl'Yairs has a policy of‘shamd conﬁdentiality" Allcc
said, whldi mm that staff members “lmy consult wlrh one
anodier about a Student ror die purpose oroooidinaring sen'lza.
profusion consulnuon, and/or rercrrul,“ sccordrng to the snl»
dent handbook “It's sort ofdn oxymoron," said Alice.

“I really think students should have more ofct right to
[dteldc] who knows [about their mental lllncss]," she said.
“It's a private issue. And lmving no control makes [the Situa-
non] worse."

After her hospitalization, Student AfEtits put Alice on
conrracr. “A student comes undcr conrrrcr when they [posc]
a risk ro rhcrnsclm [or] others. :lnclwllcn rhcrcs enough cause
ror the college to bc concerned about a particular person."
said Associate Dean ofStudent Affairs Jennifer Kmhn.

A student can come under conrracr irhc or she nrtcrnpts
suicide and also for behaviors such as alcohol abuse and Entr
rug disorders, .

“We [purscudcnrs under contracr] to keep them in school
through dimculr periods,” Krohrl said

Alicc said contracts are arranged individually end can in-
cludc clauses that say, for example, “I won’t kill myselfwhilc
I‘m at Grinnell" or “I will work with a person at the Mental
Health CEhter regularly."

Ifsh: breaks her contract, Alice said, she “will get kicked
out."

Alice’s contract also rcqulrcd hcr to sign n waivcr l'cchSv
ing hcr Mcntal Hcrtlth records to Student Affaim she said.
Bccaosc orrlus, things slit- tells her psychologist are no longer
conﬁdential,

“Part of my contract says I won't cut while I’m n student
or Grinncll," Alice sud. "rrl did cur, I couldn't tell my psy»
chologisr [widrourl getting kicked our. "

——
"Having no control makes
[depression] worse."

“I hate (it: contract wirh all my heart," Allcc said. “Its
rhc dumbest thing, They’re basically saying, ‘If you cry to
kill yourself, you better do a danrn good job or you'll gcr
kicked our.”

Alicc mme ro Grinnell aircr sccrng a psychologist at
home for a ycar. “1 fun went to a psychologist . . . because
I knew that I didn’t [feel] good," she said.

Alicc was hospirrlizcd once before coming to Grlnncll,
during hor senior ycal orhrgh school She was sour to a
