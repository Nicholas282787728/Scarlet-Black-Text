One might say that after at years oi
coaching various Grinneil College sports
and directing intercollegiate athletics icr
most at that time, John Piitsch knows how
the ball bounces.

Plilsch. 66, will be succeeded this spring
by Dee rnii-cliild. who becomes only the
second woman to serve as athletic director
til an loiia NCAA college. He still plans.

’ihoti-ci-er, to coach soccer next tall.

Plitscli began his headrcoaching career
tit lilidiaiid College in Fremont. Nebraska.
wiicrc he handled all sports and served as
athletic director tar two years in 1948.116
moved to Griiinell as basketball coach and
aSSISlzint in iooiball Four years later. he
became athletic director and has held the
position ever since,

Plilsch has coached his specialty,
basketball. at Grinncll ior 23 seasons At
other times. he has also coached iooiball.
baseball. tennis. and soccer. and has held
positions at the wheel olgoll, track. wrestlr
ing

while memories at a 1952 tennis title. a
1952 basketball championship. and a 1934
soccer championship linger. Ptitsch
prefers not to keep track oi his success in
coaching by wins and losses. Instead he
likes to remember the young men he has
coached over the years.

--l have gotten to know the kids well over
the years." he said. "And have had
nothing but positive relationships with
students I still manage to keep in contact
with many or them to rind out what they
have done since graduating iroi-n Grinnell.
At Grinnell. we usually have two odds go-
in a ainst us.

BEST WISHES

During his tenure as head coach. Ptilsch
has seen both championships and winiess
seasons "Personally. l get some enjoy»
meiii out at being the underdog and
lighting our way to the top ~ and we've
had to do a lot or that "

when asked it he would take the job
again it it was olicrcd to him. Flitscli
replied. “It would hiiie to depend on what
the Job involved When l tii‘sL came here. I
was hired to teach and coach lull-time. and
later on. do the athletic director yob on the
side. it really wasa low key iob back then.
Nowadays. ii is a lot more high key, in
terms of wha| has to be done in the pOSitlon
as athletic director .

”There really is a lot more involved to~
day." he continued "one reason is that
the women's program has really
developed quite a bit here. Today. we have
almost as many women's teams as we do
men‘s. not totally equal. but a lot more
than we had when I started. Another
reason is that because oi the increase in
athletic programs at Grinnell. there isa lot
more administration that has to he done. in
terms oi decisionrniakmg and paperwork,
However. il l hadn‘t felt that the iob was
inieresting and important. i would have
icil. A lot has to do with the personal relar
lionships that are tornied here "

Piitsch said Grinneil's athletic program
is very important — certainly ior peoplc
who like it "There are a lot pi people who
like exercise and competition and having
that motivation is par! 0! the educational
experience here. i still get excned beiore
every game. even though i have coahced
over 100 teams In mv career ..
