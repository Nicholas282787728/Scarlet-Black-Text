Eul Rule Reduces
Infirmary Slay To
24 Hour Minimum

A new cut rule, onC which
lowers the confinement time
necessary to receive excused
illness ahsences and grants un-
limited cuts to persons on the
Dean's list, goes into eifect this,
semester.

Changes in the drinking rule
and its enter-cement also have
been made during the summer,

Women over 21 are now
permitted to drink oft the
campus in accordance with
the Iowa state law, and on
north campus the Council oi
House Presidents no longer
holds the responsibility ior
eniorcement ot theilalv. The
enforcement now lies with the
administration.

The League Board is studying
the C of HP move, but has not
reached any decision regarding
enforcement on south campus.

The new cut rule reduced the
number of hours of confinement
necessary for an excused illness
absence from 72 to 24. A stu—
dent must be confined in the
infirmary or in a hospital to
receive an excuse. ‘

Commenting on the shiit ot
, drinking rule responsibility
Dean of Men Henry A. Brown
declared that anyone caught
violating the rule will be out
tor the semester.

He also stated “There is no
night watchman heing hired for
north campus, and there will be
no night watchman hired un»
less the men show us that they
are not going to live by the‘
rule."

A minor change was also
made in the car rule. Beginning
next spring, seniors will be per»
mitted to have cars atter spring
vacation. I.

To get a car, written ap-
proval trom the student's par- ,
cuts and a written request
from the student must be
made beiore spring vacation,
and the car must be register-
ed in a state and in the Dean's
office.

It also must be insured, andl
the student must he a licensed
driver, Only the student in
whose name the car is registered
will be permitted to drive it.

The car rule change will not
attect scholarship students, be
cause no scholarship students
will be permitted to register a
car. ”If a person needs scholar-
ship aid," Dean Brown said, “he
shouldn't be able to pay the ope
crating costs of a car.”
