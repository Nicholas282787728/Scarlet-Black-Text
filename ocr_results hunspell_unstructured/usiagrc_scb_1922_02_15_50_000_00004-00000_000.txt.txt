:‘The lightning of really great actr
ing does sometimes ilash out of n
clear sky." These are the words in l
which the eminent critic, Mr, Louis'
Foe of the New York World, begins
his review of Lionel Barrymore's poi-
foi-manoe of “The Claw,” which is at
the Princess Theatre, Chicago. It was
Lionel Barrymore, he says, “who, by
the brilliant culmination of a per
formance that throughout was on a
level now seldom found in the theatre,
added new lustre to the family name."

"The Claw” is by the famous French
dramatist, Henri Barnstein, and no
writer of our time is a greater master
of dramatic technique or knows bet—
ter how to build, on human emotions
until every auditor in the theatre sits
with hated breatd waiting [or the
clash at the forces of fate in the cli-
max of his story. This play tells of
the infatuation of a man or middle
age, Achille Cortelon. radical leader
and editor of a. Socialist organ, for a
chit of a. girl, Antoinette, played by
Irene Fehwick, whom he believes to be
all innocence and simplicity. But
she is a scheming Circe, and plays
the older man to the‘top of his hent.

From A Faint Blue Glow

To Modern Miracles

DISON saw it ﬁrst—a more shadow of blue light streaking across the

nals inside an imperfect electric lamp. This “leak" of elec—

tric current,‘an obstacle to lamp pe'rlection,was soon banished by

more air from the bulbs.

But the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance in a high
vacuum remained unexplained for years.

J. J, Thomson established the electron theory on the trans-
ty in a partial vacuumiand the blue light was
in at very high Vacuum, however, the light and appar-
currents that caused it disappeared.

One day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company proved that a current could be made to pass
through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to
fixed laws.

But the [' Linton light had vanished.

Here was a new and deEnltc phenomenonwa basis for further re-

oi their life. Though he marries her
and hankrupts himsel! to give every
luxury, she has no gratitude Cll‘ sym:

last drop. Finally, when he has in-
cﬁmlhated himself by selling his vote
in the Chamber of Deputies. she runs
away with a wealthy lover, leaving
him to face disgrace and death alone.

immediately; scientists began at series of experiments with far reach-
ing practical results. A new type of X—ray tube, known as the Coolidge
tube. soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron
and Pliotron, followed in quick successiun by the Dynatron and Mag-
netron, made possible long'cllstance radio telephony and revolutionized
radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of the “tron" family has only
begun.

The troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly forty years
ago. But for scientiﬁc lescarch, it: would have been forgotten. Yet
there is hardly a man, woman or child in the country today whose
life has not been beneﬁted, directly or indirectly, by the results of
the scientiﬁc investigations that followed.

Thus it is that persistent organized research gives man new tools,
makes available forces that otherwise might: remain unknown for

centuries.
