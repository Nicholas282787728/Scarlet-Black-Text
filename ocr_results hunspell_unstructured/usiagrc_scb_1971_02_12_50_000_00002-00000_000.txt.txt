Faculty Meeting

mined, and partly because it
seems unjust that any one part
should have to render up the
last full measure of devotion
(Le. unemployment) for the
excesses of the whole.

The President finished his
address on a note of condi-
tional optimism, or some?
thing. He quoted Walt Kelly‘s
immortal, "We have met the
enemy and he is us",and sug*
gested that, for the near futr
ure, the struggleavaileth. Ac-
tually, as I remember, anr
other way that it goes is this:

"There is no need to sally
forth, for it remains true that
those things which make us
human are, curiously enough,
always close athand. Resolve,
then, that on this very ground,
with small flags waving and
tinny blasts on tiny trumpets,
we may meet the enemy and
not only may he be ours, he
may be us."

The next piece of Business
was ostensibly the admission
of soccer to the pantheon of
approved Varsity Sports. This
was introduced by WaidoWal—
ker with a nicely worded den
fense of the whole currentand
projected budget of the Phys.
Ed. Department.

The gist of his speech
was that the P.E. dept. is
to suffer a budget cut of
$12,000 for the current year
and projected at $63,000 for
1971-72.

75% of this cut is to come
out of intercollegiate sports,
and less than ten% from came
pus recreation.

The soccer bill passed, and
the next item of business was
the opening shot of the Great
Reorganizational Debate, wh-
ich .‘can be expected to pro:
vide this semester‘s equiva‘

lent of last semester’s Great '

Abolition Debate. .

THE PROPWAL advanced
by the Executive Council this
week was, by and large, a
direct reading of Leggett‘s
Reorganizational Proposal,
Sec. D, Subsec. 3b. The idea
was, I suppose, to gain faculty
approval of the beginning of
the Great Experiment. The
motion reads as follows:

The faculty hereby authorir
zes the Executive Council of
the Faculty to forma subcomt
mittee of itself comprising the
three EPC chairmen, the
member-at-large, the chairs
man of the faculty, the Dean
of the College, the Dean of
Administration, and the Pre-
sident to exercise its funcr
tions in matters ofeducational
policy, and it further authors
izes the Executive Council to
associate with that subcomr
mittee, withvotingstatus, four

students: the President of the
SGA and one student elected
by and from among the mem-
bers of each of the student
divisional EFC's. This divi-
sion of the Council and the
association of students with
the subcommittee is to be re-
garded as an experiment.

To this, Mr. Worley proposed
the amendment that a student
member-attlarge, appointed ‘
by the Student Senate, be add-
ed to the membership of the
subcommittee, partly because
imbalance might prove irk-
some, but mostly because a
large committee should have
more and better ideas than a
Small one.

Mr. Kleinschmidt spoke ag-
ainst the amendment, citing
the "mystique" of parity of
numbers, and it passed, 31
for, 25 against.

Just Plain Irwin Goldberg
then proceeded to set new
standards for Rational Dis-
course here on the farm, by
referring to some unspecified
person or persons as "ama-
teur . . . democratic . . . urr
enlightened incapable . , ."
He was, it would appear, sp-
eaking to the ”Question of
Professionalism"

"We owe it to the Profesr
sion" (Quoth J.P.I.G.), not to
allow students a voice in the
determination of major re-
quirements. This was,he said,
no attempt to derogate stud-
ents. “We forget that they
are students . . . we take them
at their word".

The Revolving Door is
screening new applicants for
training. The staff increase
reﬂects the use that students
have made ofthe center, which
has treated eleven cases in

-the eleven days since it im~~

plimented its new schedule
(7 p.m. to 7 a.m.).

So far a breakdown of the
above cases reveals:

Nine counseling cases and
three drug- related cases.
Five women and six men.
Eight personal contacts to
three by phone; in one case a
staff member went to the
taller’s room.

The ﬂexibility ofassistance
is considerable, and aid is
always available there. After
hours and offtcampus mils
will be transferred by the
operator with no questions
asked.

Due to the ﬁct that 1couldn't
focus on my cards, I pre-
sented an extemporaneous spt
eech on the moral implication
of Marxism. Apparently the
judge was capable of under”
standing the aesthetic quali-
ties of such a system, since
we won the round. We finished
our final round and returned
to Grinnell.

Awakened by the third cock’s
crow at 6:00, I proceeded to
wait two hours for my antit
cipated ride, which proved to
be delayed due to the previous
night's faculty party. We arr—
ived a half-hour late and pro-
ceeded to debate in a singular
manner for the next two ro-
unds. Final tally showed one
stiffened win and six sobered
losses. I resolved to im,
prove my technique according
to the procedure which proved
to be most successful.

The fantastic preps of '74,
Jeff Factor and Bill Green,
dressed in hiking boots, car-
ried the day with their oli~
gopoiy proposal. Qualifying
for the quarter-final round,
they proceeded to win dieir
way into the finals. However,
in a true reaction to the Grin-
neii reputation, the judges, in
a 2—1 decision, decided nor to
allow the two freaks to carry
the day and they took second
place.

With the twopowerfulmouths
of these preps, and the return
of Phil "The Fluent" Sasich,
the Grinnell Forsensics Unit
should be in competition for
#1 ranking in next year’s sea?

Coryell Comes Saturday

This Saturday night, Grinnell
will host the rock and jazz
guitarist, Larry Coryell. Co-
ryell is known as one of the
finest technical guitarists in
the music world today. exce-
ptional with both rock and
jazz styles.

He got his real start playing
zUltar with Gary Burton. He
then left the group to go out
on his own. He's played many
gigs in the New York area,
and he has recorded a num*
ber of albums, the best being
”The Dealer" which failurEd
Coryell.

Coryeil's music is hard to
classify; it is actually a mix-
ture of rock and jazz. (To use
a trite tcrm, his music is the
acid type of rock.) He is com-
ing to Grinnell with a four
piece band, an organ, guitar,
bass, and drums. One unusual
part of his concert is where
he and his wife sing soft balls
ads; this is something fairly
new in his act. He will be
performing in Darby Gym St’
arting at 9:30. Be therel
