Everyday
gender play

The skirt slides on easily, but the bra will barely
close. The smeared eyeliner looks sexy, but it s only
there for the laughs. The hilarity really starts when
he stumbles down the loggia, struggling to walk in
heels two sizes too small.

Drunken weekend parties are hardly the time to
make academic points regarding gender and femir
nism, butlasr week’s MatyB. James party points to
some of our assumptions about gendet identity.

When preparing forMary B. James, Grinnellians
hope to create an image that' is instantly recognin
able as “male”or “female.”To get this look, it’s easiest
to embrace the most extreme stereotypes of mascu-
linity and femininity and forget about those who
often wear both sparkly tank tops and baggy jeans
in deﬁance of conventional notions of gender.

Mary B. James may reinforce gender norms
rather than mix them up. We explore an alternate
gender identity for the night. Our one night stand
with cross dressing further stigmatizes transpeople
Gender confusion is a reality for many, both on
cam us and m the larger world.

cm: of us perform a gender that does not cor

respond to our assigned
sex every day, rather
than just once a year.

Some struggle to
bind their breasts. A few
undergo hormone ther-
apy to achieve a gender
identity they ﬁnd more
comfortable Others
just live uneasily in their
assigned gender rules.

For most students,
MaryB. James is a night
for harmless laughs by
poking tun at cross-dressing. But making gender
transgression the object of ridicule only entrenches
a false gender binary_of“normal”and “anomalous."
In getting our laughs, we may unintentionally ce-
ment out ways of expressing gendei lather than
opening them up.

We come to Grinnell not only to learn but to
find ways of incorporating that learning into our
ethical codes. Mary B.James presents a chance to
find ways of pushing social norms and boundaries.

lwish to express to my family, supporters and the Grinnell com,
munity my utmost thanks for supporting me during my incarcera~
tion.

The words thank you seem small and insigniﬁcant compared to
the love and support I have felt.

on Nov. 20, 2005, I took a stand for justice
for our brothers and sisters in Latin America. I
was arrested for a nonviolent act of civil disobe»
dience at Fort Benning, GA, during the annual
School of the Americas (SOA) protest.

As a repeat oﬁ’ender (also arrested in 2003),
Judge Faircloth chose to scntencc me to six months in prison and
a $200 ﬁne when I pled guilty to the misdemeanor charge of may

ass.

P I passionately believe it is time to investigate the legacy of tornite
manuals and atrocities linked with the SOA, also called WHINA
SEC, to build relationships and trust in the Western Hemisphere
and to send a positive humantrights message to Latin America [see
“soa\v.org"].

You can help by calling Representative Boswell 888-432-1984

(toll free in Iowa), or your Representative in D. C., 202 224 3121,

on Monday morning, the campus Transgender, Genderchieer
and Allies Discussion Group put"Gendet Neutral Restroomllsigns
over the men's and women’s signs outside of bathrooms in ARH,
Bucksbaum, rhe Forum, Burling and Noyce.

The purpose of this action was to raise awareness of the need
for bathroom designations that accommodate
people who do not feel comfortable using either
the men’s or women’s room because of their gene
der identity or perceived gender identity.

This action contributed to the newly formed
Transgender, GenderQleer and Allies Dis-
cussion Group's mission of raising awareness
about the issues faced by individuals whose gene
dcr identity falls somewhere outside of the dominant “man" and
“woman” categories, including transgender and genderqueet folks.

The action was intended to draw attention to the daily struggle

and urge them to support HR 1217, Representative McGovetns bill
to close and investigate the SOA/WHINSEC.

By calling TODAY and urging your Representative to cospon—
sor HR1217, you join me in saying NO to killing, NO to torture,
and YES to a more peaceful future for our den
scendants.

We will surely look back at “those times" in
amazement that peace lovers were locked up for
months in our already overcrowded prisons for
disagreeing with Us. foreign policy that trains
international terrorists and teaches torture.

It pains me to know] cannot thank each ofyou individually for
your support.

Husband Jay deserves a bouquet for his sacriﬁces. I deeply ape
pteciate Grinnell College’s decision to allow me to return to work
in the tall, I feel richly blessed by my experiences these past ﬁve
months, and now I look forward to coming home on May 19,

Do not give up hope that nonviolent resistance and love will
change our world for the better.

greater equality

many transgendcr and genderqueer folks face when looking for
n restroom. According to a booklet published by the Transgenr
der Law Center entitled "Peeing in Peace," “many transgender
people are harassed, beaten and questioned by authorities in both
women's and men's rooms Because of this, many transgender
people avoid public bathrooms altogether and
can develop health problems as a result.This not
only affects people who think of themselves as
transgendcr, but also many others who express
their gender in a nonrstcreorypical way but who
may not identify as transgender (for instance, it
masculine woman or an effeminate man).” We
encourage you tojoin the discussion about gen-
der identity issues, and to take action with us as we work towards
greater equality.

Congratulating DAG House on a job well done

i want to congranilare DAG House for throwing what is, in my
opinion, the best special dinner in Grinnell history: the Renaissancv
themed special dinner last night. Any hack can craft a special dinner
that will delight students with novel and delicious food choices, but
it takes true genius to make every Grinnell student feel as if they‘d
stepped into a time warp upon entering the dining hall.

As Dining Selvlce's Terry VVitltersdorf, FMP, explained to me via
e-mail, DAG was responsible for selecting the menu for the event.
So,I want to thank rlnr illustrious organization for designing a menu
that contained exactly two nonrstandard menu items: beet salad and
barley soup.

Nowl heard a lot of people in that dining hall saying a bunch
of ridiculous nonsense like, “Shouldn’t a special dillnel otter spccml
food?" You hiIECIS nccd to get i chic Let me enlighten you \thn l
ieitlizcd that the only thing special about this inner WAS the unnsnr
ally high number otr'lincrs" wcnung chain nuil, I expel icncod a feeling

of intense dissapointnient and hopelessness that must have closely
replicated the way Renaissancetcra peasants felt every day of their
lives. Now, the legenday “Puttin’ on the Ritz" special dinner might
have ﬁlled your stomach, but did It broaden your cultural and historir
cal perspective in exactly the way a Grinnell experience should?

I think not. However, the credit can’t all go to DAG. I also want
to thank Dining Services, for giving Gl'inncll's premier group at
foam sword wieldcrs and Dungeons beDragons players Control over
my dining options for one magical evening.

Now, I’ve read a lcr about the horrors ofliving under a monarchy,
but onlv when 1 realized who was responsible tor my dismal dining
options did 1 really understand the way it tools to be controlled by i
group that has absolutely no legitimate claim to authority over you.
Thank you, Dining Services and DAG, fm teaching mo ii lesson in
suffering and oppression.
