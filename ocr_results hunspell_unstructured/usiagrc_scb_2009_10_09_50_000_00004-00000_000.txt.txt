Academlc Calendar I‘eVISIOl'I

av MATT BACHTELL

This past Wednesday, sGA and Joint Board met to discuss
revisions to the academic calendar.

Due to wellness concerns within the student body, changes
are being reviewed for the academic calendar that would be con-
ducive to a more ﬂexible curriculum. Though no specific mea-
sures have been proposed, it has been suggested that the colleges
\mcal‘lons could be redistributed over a given semester in an effort
to ease stressr

A 2004 report on student anxiety at Gtinnell identified stress
as the biggest problem on campus. In 2007, the American Col-
lege Health Association (ACHA) assessed Grinnell studenrs’
stress levels and compared them with peer institutions. Studies
found that Grinnell students were more stressed, exhausted and
more affected by depression.

“I think [SGA President Harry Krejsa ’10] is looking for
ways to address that to lessen the pace a little bit,"said Wellness
Coordinator Jen Jacobson 95.

Vice President of Diversity Elena Bernal, who has been
in charge of enacting the Hate Crime Response Policy
(HCRP), believes facilitating a productive student response
is one of the administration’s primary goals.

With the agreement of the SRC and SGA, Bernal is not
treating the recent events as hate crimes, as no crime was
committed. Instead the events of this weekend constitute a
“biarmotivated incident," a subsecrion of the HCRP. Ber—
nal sees this as one part of the needed reaction, saying “any
response is much, much more than what's in a delineated
protocol."

To this end, both Berna] and the staff of Student Afr
fairs are excited by the commitment of student groups and
individuals to promote tolerance. “l was really impressed by
[students‘] desire to educate the community," said Assistant
Dean of Students and Director of Residential Life Andrea
Conner.

As part of the administration’s personalized approach,
East campus RLC Dan Hirsh, has been investigating the
matter and talking to potentially involved students “[Rcslr
dential Life] can only react to what we know, I think we
have a responsibility to do what is accurate,"Hirsh said. “I'm
accountable for all the students, regardless ofpast actions or
alleged poor decisions. I have a responsibility to those who
may or may not have been involved."

With so much attention concentrated on Rathje lst, reSr
idents oftl-ie ﬂoor have been hesitant to voice their opinions.
“The reason why we've been afraid to talk is because there’s
so much controversy about what happened on our floor and
because there are a few floor mates who have been involved
with this," Karl said, on behalf of his floor. “We don’t want
to make a situation that’s difficult for them more difficult."

After Karl found a door decoration defamed with ho-
mophobic slurs at the beginning of the year, he wrote in
response, “Welcome to Grinnell. We don’t talk like that
here." Karl, believing the homophobic gesture was a one—
time thing, said he decided not to file an official complaint
because he did not want to get administration involved.

After word ofthe second incident in Rathje reached Karl
through Fulgoni, he felt compelled to share what he had
observed "I’m still getting used to the idea that these things
are not okay,"l(arl said. “...]ust because I don’t feel attacked,
I’m realizing that the community here is being attacked."

“Even if people who live in those rooms were not ofe
fended by what was written... the presence ofthose words
creates a hostile environment for people who identify in or
with the LGBT community," Conner said. “Even if this is
intended as ajoke, the impact is not ajoke."

There are several resources in place for students look-
ing for guidance including an anonymous coming out group
[cog], counselors, Student Affairs and the SRC. Richards
son emphasized, "It's really important for us to remember
that, by and large, Grinnell students are fairly support ofthe
queer people and really care about diversity and really want
to combat all kinds ofoppression on a daily basis."

These incidents were made public in the days precede
ing Coming Out Week, Hosted at Grinnell by the SRC,
StoneCo and other LGBT activist groups, Coming Out
Week consists of an array of activities including discussions,
a ﬂip cup tournament co-sponsored by the SRC and Bas-
kcrball team and the “BBQxeer” event, including a game of
touchrfootball and a barbeque, leading up to National Come
ing Out Day on October 11.

“If there was ever a good time for coming out week to
land, it's right now," Conner saidr“They’ve already done the
legwork earlier in the semester to prepare for these events."

stitution."

During fall semester, Grinnell has seven uninterrupted
weeks of class before break in October. In the spring semesn
ter, there are eight uninterrupted weeks before spring break,
A comparative study by the Registrar's oﬂlce found that, nine
out oftwelve Liberal arts schools observe at least one holiday in
the ﬁrst few weeks of semester. A correlation between the col-
lege’s stress levels and scheduling demands prompted the SGA
resolution to review the calendar.

"We're not producing any specific model for the faculty...
because there are so many things that go into making the caln
cndar as it is now that we don't presume to be able to offer
them an alternative model and say, ‘Okay, go do it,"’K.rejsa said.

The academic calendar currently has strict parametetsiM
weeks are set in the fall and spring semesters for classes, fol-
lowed by a week ofexams. In a 2004 letter to the SE98, Henry
Walker, Computer Science, noted that this was exceptional-—
typically. colleges hold 1213 week semesters.

“For the most part they have fewer weeks of classes than

promises to improve student health

we do." Walker said. “Which means courses either have
even more stuffpadted into them,or you're simply dropping
out content." Further limits on the calendar are the holir
days~the calendar sets two weeks for spring break, and one
week for fall break This constrains the fall semester, already
bounded by winter break.

Making the desired adjustments without sacriﬁcing the
curriculum will prove to be challenging. IfhoLidays cannot be
redistributed, the extra days will have to be taken away from
classes, which would marginally increasing student workload.

“It is all very preliminary,” Krejsa said, “It's all just saying,
“We need to start talking about this.. .[it] is a problem".

Joint Board agreed to review the calendar resolution and
vote on it next Wednesday. Whether or not revisions are de
cided upon, it may be a long time before they will take effect.

“We plan our academic calendar several years out...so
I don’t know how soon a change like that could be made,"
lacobsen said.
