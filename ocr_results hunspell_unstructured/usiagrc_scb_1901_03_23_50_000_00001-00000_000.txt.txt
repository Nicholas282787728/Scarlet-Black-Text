To Mrs. Flora Collier Noyes.

Those connected with the col-
lege twenty years ago will be
grieved to learn of the death at
the Mary Thompson hospital in
Chicago, on March r4. of Mrs. w.
A. Noyes, of Terre Haute. Ind.
An apparently successful surgical
operation was followed after three
days by sudden unfavorable
changes, which proved fatal.

Miss Flora Collier was a student
with the class of ’83 fiom '79 to
’8I. She was married December
24. i884. to W. A. Noyes, I. C. '79.
since 1886 Professor of Chemistry
at Rose Polytechnic Institute,
Terre Haute, Ind. Five years
later she spent ayear in Germany
with her husband, but returned
saddened by the loss of a little
daughter, buried at Munich. One
son, William Albert Noyes, Jr.,
aged three years, survives.

A Trlbute of Friendship,

At the death of the late Prof.
Simmons, an encumbency still re»
mained upon his home in Grinnell.
His many friends in town, among
the Trustees and in the Alumni
Association, not forgetting the
patient, thoughtful man whomade
many material sacriﬁces for Grin»
hell, and realizing the burden
placed upon his family, needed
but a leader to let their sympathy
takesubstantial shape. Professor
Main opened before these friends
a splendid opportunity, which at
his mere suggestion met with
unanimous approval. As a result
the entire amount of one thou»
and dollars has been pledged and
nearly all the“ pledges redeemeﬂ.
Most of these promises were made
individually. but the classes of ’92,
’94 and ’97 completed this amount
through organized etfort. This
will clear the home completely,

The deedsofgood men often
find most reward after they them-
selves are gone. It is beautiful to
think of this voluntary tributeto
the memory of Prof, Simmons.

 

Seniors Give Progra ==
Juniors Assist.

The program of the Institute
society on Wednesday last was
given entirely by the seniors, this
being the Fiist of the series of
classpiograms. The programwas
opened by roll call in which, after
every name, appropriate quota»
tions were given by the seniors.
Next followed a solo by Miss
Cadwell in the prelude to which
appeared the ﬁrstjunior assistance
—although it was ofa negative
sort. Paper had been stuffed in
the piano, but after its removal
such a pleasing solo was given
that the audience simply demandr
ed an encore. Blatherwiek suc-
ceeded Miss Cadwell on the ﬂoor
and gaveawellthoughtoutspeech
upon thelynchingquestion. Dur-
ing the latter part of his speech
an alarm clock was heard in the
Junior Corner, attcsting to the
presence of the irrepressibles.

In the oration by Arnold. which
followed the speech, important
points were emphasized by loud
noises from the juniors, evidently
made by ﬁre crackers. This fail-
ing to produce any evident em-
barassment on the part of the or-
ator, about a peck of shelled corn
which had been cunningly con-
cealed in decorations above the
president's‘chair was dumped, and
spattered from the president's
head over the ﬂoor. The oration
was now concluded in a spirited
manner in spite of all.

Miss Johnson then favored the
society with an excellent selection
in an excellent manner, assisted
by the tinkle of the alarm clock
in the distance. This closed the
junior part of the program and
the seniors continued now with a
debate on the question,“Resolved,
that the Senior girls' club is a det-
riment to Iowa College." Both
sides thoroughly discussed the
club from their respective points
of view, presenting charts and sta~
tistics galore in proof of their
statements. The judges ﬁrst pro-
nounced the debate a tie. but on a
second ballot decided three to two
in favor of the negative. The pro-
gram was closed with a prophesy
by Macartney, in which he chose

for his time. setting ten years
hence, and described each of the
present Seniors at that time.

 

lOWA. SATURDAY. MARCH 23. lQOl,

Coming Conflict Between Lewis
and Athens Literary Societies.

Glenn Clark, '03, went to Oskar
loosa last Thursday to complete
arrangements foradebate between
the Lewis Literary Society of
Iowa College and the Athens Lit»
erary Society of Penn College.
Last year our academy society
challenged the Gi‘innell High
School debating team and defeat
ed them by a decisive victory.
They had decided to debate with
the High School this year, but
since it was the latterls tul’n to is-
sue the challenge. which did not
seem to be forthcoming at a late
day, our boys began to look
around for stronger competition
and negotiated a debate with the
Penn boys, The event will take
place at Oskaloosa Saturday ev»
ening, May Ii. The question at
issue is “Resolved, that all indus»
trial disputes in the United States
should be decided by a national
board of arbitration and this arbi»
tration shall be compulsory.” Ac»
cording to the debating contract
drawn up, each speaker shall have
twelve minutes for his debate and
the leaders shall have seven mine
utes each for their rebuttal. To
guard against a result such as the
Chrcstomathians experienced in
their proposed debate with Simp-
son, the compact provides that
if either society fails to appear, it
shall forfeit the debate. The Lew-
is Society will be represented by
F. M. Hanson, D. Dunn, W. E.
Paul, and W. A. McIlrath as al»
ternate. Arrangements are in
progress to make this debate an
annual event, If this is done, the
debate will be held in Grinnell
next year.

May Festival Put on Business
Basis.

Tuesday evening a meeting was
held in Sec’y Robbins' ofﬁce at-
tended by representativcs of both
town and college. The purpose
of this meeting was to place the
May Festival upon a business ba-
sis and organize it into a perma;
nent institution. A business man»
ager was chosen and the advan»
tages of an annual May Festival
fully discussed. The name adopt-
ed for this institution is the “Grin»
nell College May Festival.” The
tendency of an action of this kind
will be a still closer union between
college and town, an end in itself
very desirable.
