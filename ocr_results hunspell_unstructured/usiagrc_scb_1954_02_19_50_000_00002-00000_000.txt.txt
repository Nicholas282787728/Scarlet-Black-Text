SCARLET AND BLACK

February I7, I954

 

“The way our set jumps around 3-D glasses work perfectly."

Meanwhile...
Back in Grinnell. .

In the letter printed below, Jay Schulman, who taught
sociology here last year, makes some comments on student
interest which need sayingi They should be read by every
student.,It’s easy to forget the rest of tile world and the
history which is being made in the confusion of classes,
outside activities, and problems of grading and registering.

On page three is an article announcing the political
science department's Institute of International Affairs
series which begins one week from next Thursday. A re-
markable group of persons has been secured to speak and
discuss the problems of the Middle East.

Grinnell doesn’t have a Young Communist League, or a
We Like Joe club, but we are being offered a program
which has a more than passing interest. Read Jay Schtlls
man, and then go see Mr. Priestley and company.

Dear Cathy,

There are few things that a teacher . . . regrets more than
having to give up the courses he has been teaching and losing
Contact widh the keener students who populated his classes and
opened their minds‘o crack in response to his torrent of words.
The courses are a part of his ego and it is hard to told them away
into a filecase but it is harder to put out of one's mind the stu—
dents Who came through his door for a jaw and who . . make
an instructor’s life a good one.

Nine “ahl|h"s a minute:

Here's a fascinating study of
a health education class handed
me this week by an unfortunate
victim trapped in it. He swears
it’s an accurate count:

The prof started a total of
177 sentences and completed a
grand total or 90 of them. Seven
were without verbs. He used
”and‘ so forth" 16 times and
“ahhlh” 453 times

No thinking person will as-
sert that this type of survey,
which only points out the-
frail classroom presentation in-
volved, is wough to damn the
course. But TlME Magazine
has always believed that, if
you're trying to communicate
“it's not what's on the page
that counts, but how much of
what’s on the page that gets
inside the- head rf the reader.”

I think the same is true in

But photos of unsuccessﬁul

bucks in the bank aren‘t head—
lined with “Portrait oi a Falls

Could it be that our sense of

pact of the dollar sign? ls tame
