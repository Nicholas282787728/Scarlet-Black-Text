Oh. boy! Schlock Films! All the
thrills of laternight (all right, very late
nightl television before you on the Big
Screen Zowlel There is a subtle art in
volved in the making of schlock films —
it is achieved only by a certain lew. A
bad tllm does not schlock make. A
schlock iilm has to have a certain
humor about it: absolutely no one in»
volved, at any level of production, must
take it serlously! Anyway, on to the
ﬁlms:

Beyond the Valley or the Dolls. starrr
ing . well, it really doesn’t matter.
This film has nothing whasoever to do
With' Jacqueline Suzanne (thank
goodness). I haven't actually seen this
one but Steven Scheuer (our favorite
other source) called it a “vulgar,
tawdry, laughable explmtation film."
Sounds great! ill be there. (Note: [or
those of your concerned about plot, it’s
something about an allcglrl rockcombo
and their search tor stardom, in
Hollywood. Another quote lrom
Scheuer: “Every girl in the cast looks
like a playboy bunny reject and the men
run a Close second.) Well, this certain-
ly sounds like a knockout beginning to
a night oi totally mindless entertain-
ment. A word of advice 7 be fairly,
very-imbibed on your favorite libatibn.
And alter Beyond . . , get ready for:

Plan Nine From Outer Space. This is
a very special schlock rilm — an award
winner! This film is the “Golden
Turkey Award Winner for the People's
Choice of the Worst Film of All Time! "
Yes, the very worst. Boy, are you in tor
a treatt Imbibe further! The plot tyes,
lhlS'haS one also) is as follows: A group

nihilate the Earths population come
up with Plan Nine (get lt7l e the resan

wreck havoc upon the poor earthlings

ltuatlon (oh, goody) and . . . well, we
-ll know how well that works. We get to

mazing thatthe actors(7.) could keepa
‘tralght face through the movie" — the
letter for us, we can laugh at them, in-
tead of with them, A can't miss!

And finally, my favorite type or

generation gone by, will live in my
eart forever. Another note' imbibe

but it doesn't matter e all Beach
Movies have basically the same one.
Boy and Girl meet Sand. What more

Paul Lynde, it you care. There’s also a

Beach Movie is one oi the true
American Institutions, something that
affected (however indirectly) our men-
talities. And you wondered why you're

be ready for a tun, tacky, mindless

l953
Thurs, April 23, 9 pm, SL

The Japanese Film Series comes to a
close with this showing of Tokyo Story,
3 film that critic Donald Richie has
described as ”one of the greatest of all
Japanese motion pictures.” The ﬁlm
iocuses upon the relationship between
an elderly couple. mat lives in a small
seaside town nar Hiroshima, and their
children, almost all of whom have left
home to work in Tokyo. The coun-
tryside, substance and warmth vs. the
city, shallowness and uncaring? Yes
and no. Don't miss it.

F u rtivos

Directed by Jose Luis Borau
Spanish with English subtitles
Fri., 3: so p. m. SL

Furtivos. a Spanish Weekend event,
begins quite appropriately with a
quotation of Generalissil-no Franco:
“Spain is a peaceful forest,” What
follows is an ironic portrayal of
bloodletting in the dark hollows of the
Segovian forest. The story is about a

mother-sonteam of illegal poachers

surviving ln the Wild, While the gover»
nor attempts to legitimize the activities
of the two, tragedy strikes when
freedom, personified in a carelree
reform school drop—out, attempts to
liberate Angel, the son, from the
perverted life in the Karat. Quite
literally, liberation is a great challenge
since Angel's imprisonment extends all
the way to his mother’s bed.

According to Tom Allen of the village : .
Voice, rurtivos is the evidence set torn; , ,

by director/producer Jose Luis Boraii'

that allegories of Spain can finally be
produced without being censored or
banned by the Spanish government. —

Killing Us Softly

Fri, 9:30 pm, ARK; Sun., 7:30 pm;
ARH

“Why Arent Your Feet as Sexy as .

the Rest of You?"

This film part of the Women' 5 Film ‘

Series, is based on the presentation of . ‘

Jean Kilbourne, who appeared at Grin-
nell last year. It uses often humorous
examples of ads to show how the image

of women is manipulated by media,’ '

Besides such gems as “I'd probably
never be married now it I hadn’t lost 49

pounds" and “If your hair isn't"
beautiful, the rest hardly matters.“ she'

analyzes the role of women in more

seemingly innocuous ads and their con; » -

tributions to women's role in society.
Kilbourne doesn’t show only the

damaging effects or advertising on'
She shows how.
children are exploited by ads and how:

women, however,

men’s images ot themselves are

manipulated with models whose facial- . ,

expressionsrun the gamut of emotions, .
and how.
media reinforces aggression in men. .

“lrom a smlrk to a sneer."

The film is an entertaining look at the
power oi advertising which distorts our

images ot ourselves through guilt and .

false expectations. — Kendra zirbel ii

ARI-l

My Brilliant Career is a beautiful,
lyric iilm about a young woman's come
ing of age in Australia in the early
19015, It is an autobiographical film and
Judy Davls is perfect as Sybylla, the
uncommonly intelligent, high-spirited

but “plain-looking" young girl. It is. :
wonderful to watch her grow through ._

her struggle with the values of the up-
per class, which insist that she marry
and thereafter care for a home. For
Sybylla, that it Just not enough,_she
wants to live, to experience. And she
does. There is not a lot of action 7 she
falls in love, is loved and, in a wonder
tully human portrayal, grows greatly
through being the governess to a large
family living in the Bush. This movie is
warm, touching, enriching. The
cinematography is beautiiul and very
moving. No matter what else you do
this weekend, see this film. 7 Pamela
