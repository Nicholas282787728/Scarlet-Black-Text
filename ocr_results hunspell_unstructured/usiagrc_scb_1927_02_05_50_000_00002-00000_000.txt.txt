it's about time that courses were nbolisbcu hour

the university. There is really no use for them any more,

and they might, just as well, be dispensed with. It is so

stupid to study. Whenever one wants to go to or party

or do some equally important thing, he ﬁnds there are

some unnecessary things known as Cidsses lor which he
must study.

This is a ridiculous state ol‘ut‘fairs, It would be

much simpler and vastly easier to nbolish the courses
entirely. After all, a univerity is merely a place to have

a thoroughly good time, and n background of classes is
rather superllous. There are some unfortunate individu»
als who seem to think that a university Was originally a
place [or study, but this impression is quite erroneous.
A universiw Is nothing other than a social and recree

ilclally recognized, we earnestly urge the abolition of
classes. — Minnesota Daily.

HIS FAITH‘ unconquerable, his passion for

Alva Edison has achieved far more than than»
