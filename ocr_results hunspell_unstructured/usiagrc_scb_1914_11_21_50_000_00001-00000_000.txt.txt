Wisconsin tor the past three years

undoubtedly be reprcsented hy a
classy quintet again this year. The
last forty-ﬁve games played have re—
sulted in victories tor the Gopher ﬁve.
Their squad l vcar will he com-
posed ‘ol many veterans and will prac-
tically he ot the same calihre.

A "Practice Gil mo,“

Wisconsin considers this game with
Grinuell only a practice contest, which
cxplans the early date, opening the
Grinnell varsity scason almost a
month sooner than usual. in .gartl
lo the coming mix. Coach Fisher tacos
that it will he the hardest “practice
game" that Wisconsin has had tor a
long time.

M MPH Simpson.

\Athletic relations with Simpson have

been renewed. and there is a good
chance or Gi-innell anti the lndianola
institution meeting again on the has-
ketball ﬂoor.

There is some hope of a game with
Chicago University, ns Chicago is at-
tempting to negotiate a date here for
Deceinhcr 19, But. since the Christ
nlas vacation begins the elgllLeoulli it
is donhtt‘ul whether a crowd large
enough to war ant the expense would
attend the game. Chicago al\\'ﬁ)5 pros

names or the season the local
