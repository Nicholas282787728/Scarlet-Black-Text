Qualifying Exams
Help In Meel'ing
CollegeObjec’rives

The college has made real pro-
gress this year in allowing stu-
dents to meet requirements with
out taking courses in the required!
subjects, Dean Earl D. Strong
said Wednesday.

“We've met interesting situa—
tions and had lots of fun in anl
effort to let students meet the
college objectives by qualiiying
examinations, outside reading, and
extra curricular activities.”

Mr. Strong said that in this
way the college was furthering its
aim of suiting the curriculum to
the needs of the individual stu-
dent.

“There isn't ‘a required course
in Grinnell college,” Mr. Strong
concluded, "although it would be
a little hard to get out of fresh-
mah English.”

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By Jean Kiefer I

Under the direction of Dr. John
H. Burma, students of the map
riage and the family class last
semester conducted a survey of
Crinnell women concerning mar»
ital preparation.

This third annual survey is
based upon information obtained
from over 90 per cent of the
Grinnell co-eds. Many factors re-
lated to preparation for marriage
and to marital success were used
as criteria, and while the gen-
eral results were most favorable,
replies were far from uniform,

Have Trouble Economically

Answers to the questions perr
taining to the emnonllc aspects
of marriage seem to indicate that
some of the girls may have a
little trouble making the books
balance. About half of the stu—
dents answering questionnaires
bave or have had checking aCr
counts. and an equal number
have had clothing allowances.
This was not always successful,
however, for one-third said their
allowances did not last and their

parents sent them additional
[unds. Over two-thirds expected
their husbands to maintain them
on the economic lcvel provided
-by their parents, but one-fourth
admitted they had had little or
Ino experience in purchasing or
lpreparing food. Two-thirds had
never been in charge of a house
lhold a week or longer, and only
Ihalt had had a'ny training or
experience in home decoration.

Dinorences in Dating

Lack of men seems to produce
rather varied effects among the
girls. One-third admitted that
they are more careless of their
appearance now than when there
were more men on the campus.
Almost one-fourth would go to
dances stag now. whereas almost
no one would have done so be-
fore the war. Half of the girls
said they would accept blind
dates now, and about sixty per
cent would accept a last minute
date, vei-y definite proof that the
man-power shortage is as disconr
carting to college girls as to
business men. Half of the girls
are willing to date men within

Little strict Discipline

Most of the girls came from
stable families. The average
Grinnell college girl received lit-
tle strict discipline at home, but
that little discipline seemed to
come equally from both parents.
Half the girls felt equally close
to their parents and had an equal
amount of conflict with each.
in cases of inequality, most of
the girls tended to feel closer to
mothers. Nearly all the families
were connected with some church,
although about half were not der
routly religions.

About twoihil'ds of the parents;
were frank about sex matters.
