Relationships.

About 14 weeks ago, I embarked on a
literary journey through the triumphs and
trials of pooping With my housemate and
fellow duking enthusiast Benjamin Colin.

A loglcal question one might ask ts,
“Kirby and Ben why would you devote 600
words every two weeks to the process by
which people expel unwanted refuse fiom
their bodies?" Ill start with a semi personal
anecdote. . .

My sister refuses to poop outside of hei
own home.

This means she will not
duke in school, at a friend's
house or in a hotel. Not in
a gas station, a grocery store
or a restaurant,

I’m sure you can imagine
the impact of this life decie

Hmm.

Where this mysterious
choice is teally relevant,
though, is within the conﬁnes of my sister's
relationship with her boyfriend.

Kelli and jei-emy have been together for
nhont a year and a lialfnow. and the moment
I knew this relationship was for real was the
moment she called me and announced, tri-
untphantly, that she had pooped in Jeremy's
house for the ﬁrst time.

This was somewhere around the one year
mark,

dos and poos

We can all acknowledge that taking a
crap is not an attractive activity (despite the
fact that 2 gills 1 cup was mind- bon 3g liligly
popular on the YouTube circuit)

In rclationships, it starts slowly, There‘s
that first moment of shameless and casual
ﬂatulence.

I remember when my housemate asked
me in had reached that point in my own
relationship because she and her hoyt‘rrend
had gotten tlicie iii the recent past.

You know so meone really loves you when

you can tart in from of
them without worrying
they’ll never sleep wuh
you. Ever.

level ofcomfott can only
be reached once you’re
pooping
when you know they'll
know What you just did,

None of that window
clacking, scent- lieiittal-
izing spray crap. Just the holiest pinch of a
log.

I guess tltars my answer to the question
ofwhy.

Pooping is one otthe Ways you can really
gage how two people feel about each other.

When you can freely poop in front of
another person, you will know that person
loves you no inattei what comes out.

Q: Should a couple walk bani/1’ in banddown a [rowdedxtreet?
Are there any atreptablepublic displays afrﬁrtioyz?

A: There is nothing wrong with walking hand in hand in public,
unless doing so causes pedestrian trafﬁc to be impeded. In this
case, single ﬁle is the rule until the sidewalk is less crowded The
only acceptable forms of public displays ofaffection are holding
hands and casual or affectionate kisses or hugs when greeting
or saying goodbye. Other physical displays of affection should

take place in private.

 

PRIDE PARADE: If there’s one thing this school needs
more of, it’s parades. The pride parade was great,
hopefully we will see more in years to come.

 

 

PAYING FOR CUPS IN THE GRILLE. We‘ re all for
being environmentally conscious, but shouldn’t our
well- endowed college be able to pay for it?

Secrets don’t make friends

Secrets are the dumbest things in the world. It
scents that every single one is about emotions that
et cry one oi us l‘eels. Its not a secret that you need
to get held” or you 'may appeal happy but 1 nl so
insecule. So lame. We all need to get held! We’ ie
all insecure! I want to read teal secrets. Then: are
occasionally a row good ones, you know, like actual
noii-ailgsty speciﬁc secrets,biit1 have to waste a
good 15 minutes of my life tending the same one
ovel and over avaiii. Come on admins illtei out
more crap What we really need is a forum in which
we cart post anonymously about real people, like
“I heard Peter Henry slept with a squirrel on disco
night.” That would actually make rile feel fulﬁlled
and happy aboutwaxting time on the web, you
know because I would actually know some REAL
secrets.
