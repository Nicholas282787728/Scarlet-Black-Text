JOURNALISM A PROFESSION

"To be a great journalist, one must
first be educated," said Professor Fred-
erick Lazell, of the department of
journalism of the University of lowa,
in his address “How to Become a Great
Journalist” delivered before the press
convention this afternoon. .

“The educated man," continued Pro-
fessor Lazell. “has the ability to speak
‘and write the English language cor-
rectly; has a knowledge of at least
one other language; a knowledge of
this earth and its relation to the uni-l
verse. He has a definite idea of man's
place on this earth and a general
knowledge of the problems man has
hadsince the beginning of civilization

and how he has attempted to solve'

them, He has some idea of the prin-
ciples of his economic and social prog-
ress and the moral ideas that have
been enunciated from time to time by
great philosophers. He knows some
of the principles of art, in connection
with newspaper makeup. Having had
this, he will be a great journalist.

"One of the ways to be a great jour-
nalist is to be able to do small things
in a great way. Journalism is a pro-
fession, and every profession requires
of its members that they have a com-
plete mastery of the science of their
profession. ,'

Few I’ruf'ossinllnl Spellers

"I have had much experience with
reporters in such simple matters as
spelling. I have found that scarcely
more than ten per cent were profes
sional spellers. Each year at the nni~
versity, I have a large class who have
had one year at the University of lowa,
‘in addition to four years of high
school. I give them a test on about
Seventy-ﬁve words chosen from any is-
sue of a metropolitan newspaper. Not
more than ﬁve per cent are able to
spell all those words correctly.

“A large per cent are woefully deno-
ient in grammar. A great journalist
would be able to throw the grammar
out of the window and write one.

"Professionalism is the complete
mastery of the science of journalism;
the art in journalism is the application
of that knowledge of science. Every
profession requires of its members a
high degree of skill. A dentist is re»
quired not only to have the science of
his profession, but a. skill and dex-
terity in the art of his profession. A
surgeon has skill, dexterity, and a

. great degree of speed. 2The artist,
whether he he a painter, a sculptor, or
a musician, builds upon his science his
dexterity and skill.

, Skill Secessai-y

“This is true of a great journalist.
He has skill, If he is a copy reader,
he goes through pages of chaotic copy,
makes it legible, vivid, interesting, If
he writes a story or an editorial, he
has a vivid concept of it in his mind
before he sits down at his typewriter.
He writes from beginning to end, ire-
ouently without a stop.

“A great journalist knows how to
get his material. He knows a great
deal about approaching men, He is
an adept in the art of directing conver-
sation so as to get from them the in-
formation he desires. He asks his
questions so interestingly that they are
glad to talk with him because they see.
that he knows exactly the background
of the information he is trying to get.
And so with all branches of journal-
ism.

“But this is not enough," continued
Professor Lazeli, “any professional
man must keep up with his profession
The great professional man must be
one of the leaders of his profession.
He must be constantly thinking ‘What
can I do, what can I contribute to my
profession SO that‘lt may meet chang-
ing conditions and needs?‘ This is es-
pecially true of the journalist who is at
leader ln all economic, social, and
moral progress. if he does not go
forward, he will be a mediocre jour—
unlist.
Must Millie Friends

“A great journalist must be a lover

of his kind. He must have a llkcohle

sociation. whose duties would be to

copy of the rules and regulations of all
contests he sent to each high school
of the association, preceding the com
vention and that a school be prevented
from being represented on the list of
officers two years in succession.

The delegates in session also passed
a resolution thanking Grillnell col-
lege, Sigma Delta Chi, and Theta
Sigma Phi for their hospitalit , the
speakers and leaders of discussion
groups for “their interesting talks and
instructive suggestions"; and extended
a vote of thanks to the donors of cum.

lo, has achieved recognition as one
1oi the great artists of the world.
3 In many instances, it is the glauioi- of
a name rather than the ability of a
singer that brings recognition to a re-
eitalist.

Quoting Pierre Key, noted critic:
"Audiences are prone to believe that
a soprano who can arousc'ti-cinendous
enthusiasm by her singing of an
operatic role must of necessity be a
great artist They are apt to forget
that solo work is a far more severe
test of ability, because the singer.
alone on the stage, must needs create
background and setting as well as the
song itself by force of sheer artistry.

“There are niany artists with 310m
ions voices who can portray a given
role and perform given stage business
convincingly and effectively, but there
are exceedingly few with sufficient
backgrou d understanding, interpre-
tative ab ty and voice to create the
picture out of whole cloth and pre-
sent it clearly and eloquently to an
audience,

“Such an artist. however. is Miss
Dale, \Froiu coiist to coast, and
abroad as well, she has won prestige
as one of those rare sing who make
the listener forget such cxternals as
voice and technique, and remember
only the infinite charm of the chan-

the faults of the press are the faults

society is two-fold, fear and a lack of,
