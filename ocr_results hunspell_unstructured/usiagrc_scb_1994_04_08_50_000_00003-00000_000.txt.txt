PRESIDENT from page 1
Presidential candidate Aaron
Fate originally joined the SGA Joint
Board the second semester of his ﬁrst
year “more or less as a joke.“ But
after three semesters of experience in
SGA, Fate says that, “Some of the
initial cynicism has died down. I still
don't view SGA as life or death, but
I realize there are a lot of things,
things students may not realize, that
SGA can help outwith,“ Aftersitting
down and looking over all the ideas
he accumulated as a Senator, and
then talking with current President
Chad Finke and some cabinet mem-
bers aboutwhatthejob entailed,Fate
decided to run for the presidency.
Fate shares some of Horton’s
broader goals, such as an improve-
ment in townrgown relations, but has
different ideas on how to reach them.
”Improving relations with the high
school isn’tthe same task zis with the
business community." Fate believes
that the college‘s involvement with
groups like Grinnell 2000 has been
highly successful, and would like to
expand the volunteer work and
irojects done through thatorganiza»
tion. “The high school relationship is
a little more problematic, but I want
to talk with the student body there,
.ntl see what projects we can come
up with. Joint efforts such as casino
night and the hypnotist are a decent
idea, butl don't think it's Sufficient."
To improve campus security,
Fate would like to install call boxes in
r. more centralized place on campus.
nssibly outside of ARH or Loose
Hall. Presently, only one phone is
cccsslble without a key after the

buildings are locked. “We put off call
boxes because SGA felt increased
lighting and the phones in the laun<
dry rooms had priority. Now that the
lighting is going to be installed, I’d
like to see the boxes put in.” Fate is
not enthusiastic about the idea of a
security force, because he is unsure
whether a ‘security force’ is sup-
posed to reassure the students, or the
parents of visiting prospectives, and
argued tliatthe service isn’tworth the
cost

Fate isalso concerned about stu-
dents at Grinnell who live off cam-
pus, whom he believes SGA often
overlooks. He is considering putting
together a guide for student renters
that would includeinformation about
the rights of a renter as well as a list
of building codes and information
about landlords. In addition, he sup-
ports some kind of computer poll to
get all student input. “Feedback in
SSA is sometimes very contingent
on which friends the Senator talks to.
and then which Senator shows up to
JointBoard. Polling isn’tperfect,but
it’s an improvement." in addition,
Fate believes that the concrete numr
bers this type ofpolling produces can
be moreconvincing when presenting
a case to the administration.

Both candidates encourage all
Grinnell students to attend the debate
Sunday evening, April to at 7:00
pm. in South Lounge, Allcandidates
will be available to answer questions
from students and state their posi-
tions and ideas. The polls will be
open all day Monday in the post of-

VICE PRESIDENTfmm page 1

innovate as ViceAPresident.

Willig is a physics major from
Martell, Iowa who spent last semes-
ter off-campus in Atlanta, Georgia.
He is emphasizing a focus on small,
attainable goals such as moving the
pass/fail deadline to a later date and
the introduction of buf ferdays before
final exams. However, he is also
discussing morcambitiousplanssuch
asthecslztblishmenlofaStudentcom~
mittec to review issues of breadth
and diversity within the college‘s
curriculum.

Among the experiences Willig
cites as qualifying him for the posi~
tion of SGA Vice President are his
role in the establishment of Grinnell
College‘s escortservice,hisinvolve-
mentin efforistoimprovetown/gown
relations, extensive involvement in
studentorganizations, and a year as a
Student Advisor.

It was only recently that Ying
decided to become a VicerPresiden—

,iiai candidatein this year’sSGA elecr
tions. She explained that as a mem-
ber of the economics SEPC and
‘through her experience as an SGA
(Senator, she has become involved in

a number of issues that she feels she
could work on more effectively as
Vice-President.

An economics major from
Edison, New Jersey, Ying is inter»
ested in developing the role of the
SEPCs into something more thanjust
“throwingparties.” In particular, she
disapproves of the changes to the
faculty review process proposed by
the administration that would elimi-
nate the Grinnell tradition of student
interviews.

“Students interviewing other stu-
dents is an important part [of the
faculty review process]," Ying ex—
plained. “lfyou were a student in the
class of a professor being evaluated.
you would be much more willing to
give your opinion [to another stu-
dent], as opposed to writing an opin-
ion for the registrar or the dean."

Allofthecandidates stressedthe
importance of student involvement
in SGA, and promised to work for
changes that would encourage such
participation. They pointed out that
this participation can start with next
week’selection,encouragingstudcnts
to “come see the debates, ask ques»
tions,and makean informcddccision
as to how you vote."
