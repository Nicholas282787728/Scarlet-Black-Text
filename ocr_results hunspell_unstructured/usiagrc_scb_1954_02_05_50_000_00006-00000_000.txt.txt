FOR more than thirty years we have used

research day in and day out lcarning about
tobaccos and cigarettes in the public’s interest.

Continuously we and our consultants have
analyzed, experimented with and smoked all
kinds of tobaccosu especially Southern Bright
Burley, Maryland and Turkish cigarette t0-
baccos.

Our own cigarettes and competitive brands
have been submitted to the most exacting
scicntiﬁc scrutiny including thousands of anal-
yses of millions of pounds of tobaccos.

‘ From-all these thousands of analyses, and
other ﬁndings reported in the leading technical
journals, our Research Department has found
no reason to believe that the isolation and
elimination of any element native to cigarette
,tobaccos today would improve smoking

For four years we have maintained in the
smokcr’s interest an intensiﬁed larger scale
diversiﬁed research program A half-million
dollar 30—ton machine, the world’s most
powerful source of high voltage electrons,
designed solely for our use has tested tens of
thousands of cigarettes. This program has
already given to us direct and signiﬁcant in-
formation of beneﬁt to the smoking public,

Our consultants include Arthur D. Little,
Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, “one of the
largest and most rcpulable’industrial research
organizations in the country” (From Business
Week Magazine) and cmin€nt scientists from
leading universities.

Today the public can conﬁdently choose

. from a variety of brands—«by far the best
cigarettes ever made by the tobacco industry.

Many scientists within our
laboratories are analyzing
cigarette tobaccos every day
