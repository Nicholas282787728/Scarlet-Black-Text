committee urges
policy revisions

by Dave Wick

After its first month of existence.
the seven-member Student ad hoc
Admissions Committee together

gith the student representatives oi
the Admissions and Financial Aid
Committee offered several
proposals to the administration
' ring last Friday's Admissions
‘ d Financial Aid Committee
meeting.According to Bob Tracey,
spokesman ior ad hoc, the
iproposalsaim at “building student
ﬂiterest and involvement in ad-
missions as well as continuity
between Student and ad,
minstrative representatives."

The first of the five proposals
concerned commllncation between
the Admissions and Financail Aid
Committee and the college com-
mllnity, Ad hoc suggested that a
monthly newsletter might “in
crease the knowledge, interest,
and ability ofthe individuals in the
community to support the ad
3iissions process.” The

blications would include
”Characteristics of the incoming
class, progress of the admissions

rogram, as well as national news
‘ 1d opinion statements about the
college.”

A second proposal pertained to
both the competenceoftour guides
and the general willingness of
students to communicate with
prospectives. In an effort to
provide all tour guides with suf»
ticientknowlcdgeofihecoliege,ad
hoc recommended that all new
guides first attend a training
workshop. Moreover, guides would
be evaluated by all Visitors. Ad hoc

uld also like to promote such
practices as letterrwriting and
phone-calling between present

dents and prospectives.

Thirdly, ad hoc expressed its

bliefthat‘a gooddeal oi exposure

 

to residence hall life and activities
isjust as important as exposure to
academic and campus social ac-
tivities during a Visit.” To
facilitate this, ad but: suggested
that some students be allowed to
draw alone into a double and host
prospectivcs throughout the year.

”Grinnell College should
maintain its enrollment by
honestly projecu'ng the uniqueness
of its highly qualiﬁed students and
faculty and the breadth and depth
of its curriculum." This ad hoc
opinion constituted the iourth
proposal, which dealt in part wiui
the revised application
procedures. The committee ex-
pressed concern over what it
considers a misconception held by
many students and faculty that a
“pleading" approach is used in
recruiting. in contradiction, adhoc
claims that financial and
enrollment problems are not
overstressed to prospectives.
Furthermore, it was felt that the
revised application. labelled
“simple" by the committee, did
not properly illustrate Grinnell
sinlply because Grinnell is not
”simple."

To amend these situations. ad
hoc proposed that the admissions
staff poll incoming students and
prospectives to obtain their view of
the application procedures.

Finally, the committee oiiered
suggestions on the geographic
mixture of the student body and
reacted to a rumored policy that a
minimum oi 25 per cent Iowa
enrollment is to be established.
While it ielt that a large group of
midwestern students is necessary,
the committee believed that
“increased enrollment of iowa
students would detract from
diversity appeal.”

‘A slight change of plans?

by T.Elaine Corey

The newly contracted Associate
Dean of Student Affairs backed out
oi her contract with the college last
Saturday after signing the contract
in proximately three weeks ago,

.‘Eid Dean of the College Waldo
Walker.

“A lack of ethics" was Walker‘s
comment on Karol BaileyrRoth’s
reneging on her contract. The

. allege had finalized plans with
alley-Roth about two months ago.
Both Walker and Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Tederm an had spoken
with her several times since then.
9she assured them in phone con-
versations Ihat there were no
problems,

BaileyrRoth phoned Tederman
)‘aturday saying she had accepted
.a position with a Caliiornia in-

stitution and would not come to
Grinnell, Walker said. A
professional counselor with a Ph d
in psychological counseling,
Bailey-Roth told Tederman that
the California oﬂer was too good to
turn down.

Remarking that “none oi us is
very pleased about the situatio. ”
Walker said he plans to write
Bailey-Roth a letter about her lack
of ethics. Although the college
could legally take her to court and
force her to work next year,
Walker said court action would be
useless because the college
wouldn’t want someone who didn’t
want to be here.

The college has two other cane
didates now under consideration
and plans to extend an oiier soon,
Walker said.

idling di‘inai ways

by Chris Lowerand Mary Brandt

It was Friday, May 7,

and Will Collins felt
that there was no way

to forestall the impend-
ing end of his term as
SGA President. Despite

efforts to slow the process, Hie
events which would lead to the
finish of his career were
proceeding like clockwork. This
was the last dismal stage of the
battle . . . cynicism, bitterness, and
despair wracked the President.

For months his associates had
watched the series of events which
foreshadowed the end of Will
Collins’ stay in office. Numerous
scandals surfaced during the year
which were to determine the
course that would ultimately lead
to nothing short of the complete
dissolution of Collins’ cabinet in
June.

Flrst semester, Mike Herman,
the Student Auditor and a staunch
Democrat, while making a routine
check of the Concerts Committee
budget. came across a $137 bill
from a local restaurant. Noting
this as an irregularity, he con-
tacted President Collins for an
explanation. Collins told Herman
not to concern himself with it, that
the matter would be looked into. As
it turned out, these funds were
spent “wining and dining" visiting
celebrities by certain members oi
the government. Later that same
week, Herman received a small
sum of money to payoff the most
questionable part oithe tab, and an
appmvalfrom the President to pay
the rest of the bill out of govern-
ment funds. Herman followed
instructions and dropped the
matter.

Only later in the year, when
thesebills had accumulated to well
over $300, did Herman decide to
make the issue public. In the light
oi this publicity, one of those
responsible lor entertaining the
celebrities defended the action
with the comment that the “whole
music business is extravagant.”

 

President’s official statement was
that “there was homing crooked
going on.”

Outright scandal was not the
only iorcethreatening to bring Will
Collinsto the end ofhiscareer. For
weeks in a row, son represen-
tatives were failing to attend Joint
Boards meetings, crucial to the
institution of certain policies
Collins hoped to see passed into
law. Collins. outraged at his
impudence, warned that “harsh
measures” would have to be taken
if representatives insisted on
“shirking their duties.” Collins’
men were accustomed to his
spasmsofanger. For months they
had watched his mood darken, but
it was becoming apparent that a
turning point in his Presidential
career was rapidly approaching.

Not only was his power nagging
with the representatives, but even
his cabinet was falling into
disarray. Collins’ southern
strategy (three members of the
cabinet were from the South) had
iallen apart with the unforeseen
departure oi Joe Ferrell at
Christmas.

One Wednesday evening, after a
particularly grueling Joint Boards
meeting Collins and a few
associates withdrew to the Pub,
among them David Ten Eyck, the
President’s close friend and
confidant.The President seemed to
be trying to reach out to each
personeas if to convince himself
that these people were his team,
Resignation was mentioned.
Collins, observing cryptically that
hewassurrounded,launched into a
barely intelligible drawl about the
wayshe might recoup his fortunes.
Hewasa victim of circumstances.
of uncontrollable forces. 'lhe Joint
Boards and the S&B were
collaborating to get him. He had
inherited an oiiice flagrantly
misused by his predecessors
Hanson and Wyler The Third World
Group and the campus media
hated him, and so the rules were
being bent, andhe was going to be
made to pay.

Ten Eyck thought, ”the Colonel
is tired and can’t hold his liquor
well."

The next day Kathy Kramer
called Ten Eyck. “Is the President
off his gourd?”

“No. He was just drunk."
Kramer Was only half convinced.
She knew better.

“The President felt comfortable
enough about those at the table to
letdown hisguard,” Ten Eycktold
her. “Kathy, it's the highest
compliment that can be conveyed
by the President."

Late in April Mark Nissen,
treasurer, came across some
surprising and devastating in-
formation. A further review of the
books had revealed that the
President had threatened to
withhold funds for the Relays
unless Russ Damtoft allowed him

 

to ride on the fire truck in the
parade. Nissen quickly placed a
call through to Collins’ attorney,
Bill Barr. “We’ve found the
smoking pistol,” Nissen told Barr,
his voice flatand exhausted, ”It’s
the Whole can of beans.”

Barr confronted the President as
gently as he could. ,Collins’
exhaustionwasevident, “No more,
it's not worth it.” He continued,
apparently oblivious to Barr’s
presence, “i want to retire with
some grace, surrounded by my
family at Casa Kentucky. Maybe I
can become a public servant in
some capacity . . . maybe make
some goodwill trips to Cornell or
Coe. I'llshave my heard for that.”
Barr was getting uncomfortable
with the President’s unabashed
ruminations.

“I'm sorry. It’s the end, Mr,
President.H

He wished Ten Eydi or Nisserl
were here. This disintegration of
the Colonels iighb'ng spirit was
painiul to see.

Collins summoned Teri Eyck. His
friend was suspecting resignation.
”David they're shooting at me. Me
whom everyone loved.” Collins
expressed doubts about resigning,
he had misgivings about being the
first returning President to not
seek re-election. Ten Eyck, on edge
about missing thePub happy hour.
responded patiently by listing the
President's contributions,
especially in the area of ﬁnance
and the new budget.

“Will history treat me more
kindly than this year‘s Seniors?"
Collins asked. tears ﬂooding his
bespectacled eyes.

Showing a ﬂash of last minute
resolve, Collins asserted, “There'll
benotears. ..lhaven’t Cried since
Joe Ferrell left." He couldn’t help
reminiscinghnwever. “I think f'Ve
shown some creative degeneracy
in leadership. I've demonstrated
that you don’t have to be a nerd to
be in student government at
Gl‘inneil."
