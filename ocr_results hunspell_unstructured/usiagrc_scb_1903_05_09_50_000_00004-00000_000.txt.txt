An Exhibition that is not an Entrurtron.

The 1904 Annual Boat-cl wishes
to lccrlld a little tale or woe
rather tll cxnlnnntron tlrrrn as on
apology. Usually Sophomores
are more than anxious to serve on

an annual board but 1904 was a
distinct exception, everybody
wantcd to get out an Annual but
nearly all resigned when they
were elected to the board. Eleven
dropped out in this way at differ-
€nttlmes.the rentainderrnanaging
to ﬁll places as they were vacated
so that last fall there was a
pretty respcctahle board. Thcn
the faculty wrth on: rrrll snoop
cut out all but two by the
lurccmcnt of which had
been dormant (or some trrne. or
course an Annual gotten mil by
two people would not amount to
anything, so less ambitious plans
were considered and it was (‘1:
sided to get out a two year Calen-
dar to been sale Jan. r, but this
idea was also abandoned whcn it
was found that tho faculty wrls
about to issue a beautiful calendar.
Finally siierheing knocked rrhont
sufﬁciently by land lucl; it was de-
cided to give a banquetssontes
thing which does not l'cquire any
special ability on the part of the
hosts but which somehow always
seems to please. so at 7:00 p. m.
Msyzgth, will be given in the
Rand gymnasium the ﬁrst Junior
Annual Banquet. Everybody in
vitedifor ﬁfty cents. The affair
is intended as a sort of a less
formal farewell to theScniots and
a number of toasts will be given.
Then when everybody is in that
happy state of mind alter eating.

the members 0[ the board will as-
sist a few others in the presenta-
tion of a short dramatization ot
Paul Leicester Ford's little sketch
"Wanted, a Cllapelone,” which is
a very pretty story and will ““7
donhtedly be as pleasing when
presented in that form. Save
ﬁfty cents on State Meet expenses
and go to the junior Annual
Banquet.
