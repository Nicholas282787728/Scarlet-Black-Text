2 to 4 poms on Saturdaysibut contains forcinotihg historical
stuff. (next to the Smith Funeral Home)

. When real books get to be too much to handle, pick up a (very
orange) library card trom the 5mm LIIIAKY. It has children's
books, trashy magazines and volumes on crochet that durling
iails to offer. (925 Brand 5!.)

ot wheat grass juice at the MAIN Snums. Some identify this chlo—
