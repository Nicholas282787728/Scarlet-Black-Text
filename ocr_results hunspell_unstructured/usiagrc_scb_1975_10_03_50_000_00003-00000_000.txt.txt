titty students participate in
Student Recreation Commission
(SRC) activities, Involvement
'comes only atter students are
made aware or trips through
posters, the Campus Memo, the
tactivities calendar and the SRC

bulletin board in the Forum
The SEC organization is mostly
student initiated and directed, and
is under the guidance of staff
advisor Kathy McCluskey.
“Essentially I'd like to see it as a
student-run organization,“ she
comments, “but raculty and start
are encouraged to participate,"
snc activities are planned by
McCluskey and any interested
Grinnell outdoorspeople at
meetings held on the last Wed-
nesday or each month. Events tor
the upcoming month are discussed

leand then scheduled at these

monthly meetings. Final plans are
then detailed at SRC executive

meetings, which are open to all
those interested, every Sunday at 7
p.m. in McCluskey’s office in
Darby.

head the student leadership as the
two studenlcoordinators Aslale ol
otricers and people in charge or
publicity give valuable support and
assistance.

Although McCluskey states that
the Student Recreation Committee
doesn’t have much equipment, it
loans available gear to several
dirrerent college groups In order

of priority, these include physical '

education activities classes, SRC
groups, and private individuals or
groups, All equipment checkouts
are under McCluskey’s direct
supervision.

McCluskey says, “I tend to go
out on most of the tSRC) trips,"
and thinks that such excursions arc
an excellent way [or laculty to
meet students and (or students to
meet one another on something

also ConSlders an SEC trip “a real
learning experience, with gut level
involvement, and a great way for
kids to get oil campus." Although
SEC has the use of athletic vans
when not needed by the athletes,
the main reason that more people
cannot enjoy SRC trips is the
limited number oi vehicles

SRC has planned many activities
ior the upcoming weeks. A
hicycling trip in and around Backs
bone State Park, including rock
climbing for those interested, is
planned (or October ii and 12.
Experienced and inexperienced
cyclists will follow different routes
after taking cycles to the park,
both are invited to participate.

The schedule (ll events for this
weekend include a trip to Rock
Creek on Saturday (tomorrow), a
Sunday sunrise (6:00 A.l\l.) trail
ride near North Liberty, Iowa, and
a Sunday night hay ride.

During (all break, Gi‘lnnell
students may participate in a trip
to the Cranberry Backcounlry ot

In addition to these scheduled
events, McCluskey has some long-
range plans in mind. For one thing,
she and Mike Cowles are ati
tc'rnpting'to' get 'a sailing team:
together This winter McCluskey
and interested students hope to
build private whitewater kayaks
and start Iraining in the pool [or
spring ice trips

McCluskey likes to see [he
students in leadership roles. mien
students are knowledgable about
some specific terrain or have had a
great deal or experience in cam-
ping, caving. ctc., she feels safe in
allowing them to take a group out
on their own Even when she's
along, participants know that
much of the responsibility for
keeping things running smoothly
rests with them

Shc is encouraged by the tact
that. on a recent bicycle trip.

McCluskey urges students going
home [or break to bring back any
equipment they have tor winter

SRC's activities calendar is just as
mil in winter as at any other time
