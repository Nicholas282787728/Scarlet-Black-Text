H. E. BROWN.
a”;
Chrestomathian.

The program oi last Saturday's
meeting otthe Chrestomathidn son
cicty was opened with extempore
aneous work. Mr. Meade spoke
on the “Resignation of Prof. l-ler»
ron.” calling attention to Prof,
Herrori's generous and manly cone
ductduringthe whole controversy,
and advising all to read his letter
or resignation, Mr. Mc1<eag gave
an optimistic view concerning
“The Football Outlook.” “The
Situation in the Transvaal," re-
ceived the attention oi Mr.Quaiie,
while Mr. Dickinson discussed at
some length,“The Proposal." For
lowing the extemporaneous work
the society listened to n reading
by Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones took for
his reading two short selections
from Wor-rlsworih's poems.

The greater part of the time was
taken up by the debate. It being
the periodicat debate, each speake
er was allowed ﬁlteen minutes and
each side had ﬁve minutes for
rebuttal. The question was: “Res-
olved, That the Universal Prevae
lence of Socialism as Outlined by
Prof. Ely \vnultl hi: tor the Best
Interests oi Humanity.” The at
ﬁrmative was supported by Cal-
derwood and O. Rlsscr, while the
negative was upheld by Hamlin
and Wylie. The president ape
pointed as judges, Velin, Moller
and A. Risser. Tire First speaker
on the afﬁrmative. Caldcrwood,
admitted that it was the duty of
the aFﬁrmative to prove that the
new system would he better than
the old. He held that it would
do away with many of the evils oi

 

today. such as the slums, compee
tition and the evils arising theree
hem, and in place of what we now
have there would be Co-opcration.
Hamlin in his speech for the neg.
ntive used argument which
would hardly be'expecied in a de-
bate ot this sort. He held that
Prof. Ely's idea of socialism was
not the rrlen of socralrsni as held
by wiiters of today, and that Mr
Ely gives no plan for distribution.
The speaker consumed much of
his time in reading extracts from
the works of socialistic writers.

M r. O. Risser, the second speak-
cr for the afﬁimzitlve, read Prof,
Ely's deﬁnition of socialism and
discussed and explainedrt at some
length. He said that socialism
would give to each man according
to his needs, and thereby do away
wrtli poverty.

Mr. Wylie, the second speaker
for the negative, tool: the ground
that socialism could not be put in
practice, [or how can all sorts,
kinds, classes and conditions of
men be united in one harmonious
body? Socialism may be good to
think about as an ideal, but it is
not practical. The socialists can
not specify. The state would be
all. the individual nothing. Mr.
Hamlin rebutted tor the negative
and‘Mr. O. Risser for the al‘ﬁrma»
tive. After the critic‘s report the
decision or the judges was given,
which was two for the negative
and one for the afﬁrmative.

Mr. Angeld's Lecture.

Mr.A|tgeld's Lecture on Fri.
day evening will give the students
and citizens oi Grinnell an upper
tunity to hear a man who has been
prominent in national politics- for
a number of years. As governor
ot our neighboring state of Illi-
nois he had to deal with many
perplexing problems, and in doing
so he displayed a strong irrdrvidrr
ality and positiveness in action
which exposed him to the harsh,
and perhaps in some cases to the
just,criticismotthepublic. What-
ever may be thought ot his policy
and aims at this or any other pe-
riod. this is ti Me of him, namely:
he has not courted popularity,
but has pursued a course which
has seemed to him the cause of
justice, without regard to the con-
sequences. Men that are strong

 

Everybody

enough to do this are rare; and
however much we may differ from
them in opinion, they excite in us
a degree of admiration. one
prime purpose or a lecture come
mittee should be to provide
speakers who are representative
methimen who have a message
and are able to speak with some
dcgreeotauthority. Mr.Altgeld
is a man oi this type. He has
won distinction as a jurist. He
stands conspicuous as a repree
sentative ot one division at a pole
liticztl party. He isa iorcetul ads
vocate of municipal reform and
public ownership

,To listen to such a man should
be‘ esteemed as a privilege by eve
cry one who wishes to enlarge his
views and secure a deeper under
standing of important public
qt'estions.

The subject of Mr. Altgeld's ad
dress will be “The Political Phle
losopliy ot Thomas jefferson.”

Through the courtesy of Miss
Rand, the Women’s gymnasium
has been secured for the lecture
The building has a seating capae
ity of nearly one thousand. and
no cﬁort Will be spared to insure
the comfort of the audience.

or all the college organizations,
the orchestra is the most difﬁcult
to keep wrth tull membership, be-
cause of the cost of the instrue
merits and the necessarily longer
period or practice before the need-
ed proﬁciency can be attained.
Notwithstanding the changes from
year to year, recruits have always
been found to Fill the vacancies,
and the orchestra has been a great
success, numerically as well as in
regard to the quality of the work.
This year will prove no exception,
though the orchestra has rounded
into form somewhat later than
usual. In the stringed and brass
instruments the orchestra has
about its normal strength. Itis at
present in need of one ﬂute, one
clarinet. one horn and one double
bass to bring it up to its strongest
torm, and any persons who play
