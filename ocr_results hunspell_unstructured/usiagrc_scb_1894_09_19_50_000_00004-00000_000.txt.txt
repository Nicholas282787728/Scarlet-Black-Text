College team this tall.

The number oi men out at loot-
ball practice is anything lmt eu-
couraging to those interested in a
winning team this fall. Many COIII-
ments have been heard on the lack
oinew men; in fact only two or
three new men have been our for
practice Almost mery year before
this the number oi new men nearh
equaled that of the old, but this
year there have been only very
few. Even the old players are c.\‘v
tremely irregular.

Up to date not a single position
on the team is tilled. This [act
combined with the fact that a game
is to be played in a little more than
a week should bring out
