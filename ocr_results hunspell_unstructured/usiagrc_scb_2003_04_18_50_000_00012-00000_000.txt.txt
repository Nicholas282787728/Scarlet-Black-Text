J ‘ t On the eighteenth oprn'l, in 1775, Paul
V Revere, William Dawes and Samuel
Prescott rode about ten miles from Boston

to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Sam Adams that the
British army was on its way to arrest them. Revere was cap-
tured outside Lexington and Dawes lost his horse, but Prescott
made it on to concord to alert the keepers of a stash of munis
tions (which the Redcoats were atso hoping to seize), The
American Revolution began atlive am. the next morning when
70 Massachusetts militiamen exchanged shots with 250 Brit-
ish regulars on Lexington Green.

Samuel Adams was not the only brewer to oppose British rule
ofthe colonies. oeorge Washington and Thomas Jefferson kept
breweries at their estates and both had personal recipes for
favorite beers. Ethan Allen owned an interest in a brewery,

Ethan Allen, the hero of Fort Ticonderoga, never made furnh
ture. Nor did he sell antiques, baked goods, petroleum prods
utts, or run a baundromat, though entrepreneurs have since
appropriated his name for all those things.

Brand names appropriated by the masses for their own use;
Dumpster, rnsbee, Laundromat, HulasHaop, Jacuzzi, kitty Lit-
ter, kleenex, PingsPorig, Realtnl, Breathalyzer, Rollerblade,
Scotch Tape, Seeing Eye dog, Super glue, IelePlulrlpTer. (All of
those trademarks are still owned.)

The first flying-disc toys were invented in 1943 and named
”Flyin’ Saucers" in the wake of a supposed ufo crash outside
lloswell, N.M. They were renamed ”Frisbees" when Wham-o
toys—the inventors of the Hula-Hucp~hmlght the product
in 1957. The name comes from the Frishie Baking Co. of Bridge.
port, Conn; apparently Vale University students had a habit
of tossing around the store’s pie tins, shouting the name en-
grayed on the bottom of the tin to warn passevs»by of the
toys' sometimes erratic ﬂight,

No one seems to know why golfers shout"fore" to warn passerss
by to duck. It may be short for "hall before you."

Golf is thought to have originated in 15th-tentury Scotland,
The first clubs were wooden sticks; the first balls were rounded
pebbles; the first holes were rabbit holes, and the first courses
were rabbit runs, courses of open ground between warrens
maintained by hunters,

London's Soho neighborhood, today a center of artistic and
queer culture, takes its name from an old huntlhgshuund call;
the district used to be a hunting ground adjoining Westminster
Palace. New rorks SoHo neighborhood, today a tenter of ar-
tistic and tourist culture, takes its name from Houston Street,
which it is south of.

Detaits on the first Gay Pride Weeks are sketchy, but they arose
in many cities in the early 1970s, often in direct commemora-
tron of the June 23, 1969 Stonewall hrot in New York city's
Greenwich Vilbage, where patrons of a gay bar violently 12s
sisted a polite raid. Most early Pride Weeks, therefore, took
place at the end oleme.

Paul Revere didn't shout ”The British are turning,” because
American tulonists thought of themselves as British What he
did shunt was "the Regubrs are coming out!”
