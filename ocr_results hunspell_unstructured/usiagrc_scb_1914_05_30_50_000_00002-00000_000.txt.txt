conclusive opinions concerning the
success or failure of the latest unr
dertaking of the Student Count-i1.
there is no gainsaying the fact
that the work has had an anspier
ions beginning. Conditions in the
reading-room have improved fully
at hundred per cent since the Coun-
cil assumed its new responsihility
and those in charge of the worli
are to be congratulated upon its
efficiency thus far. ' i
The only danger now is that the
inemhcrs of the Council will let
down as the nornltv of the work
wears off. It Will roqui some
time to overcome the effeets of the
freedom formerly allowed the stu-
dents, anti until tho proper atti-
tude s‘ thoroughly instilletl intn

Council must not relax in its all

Mr. Tharp has the personality

Mr. Appleliy has been one of the
