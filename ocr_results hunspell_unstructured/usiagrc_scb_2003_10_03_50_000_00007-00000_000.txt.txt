Paul Heider (Father): “My
character, on the surface, is
completely and utterly will-
less. He has suppressed
most of his desires and
passions in an ettort to
survive (or escape) the life
he hates.

Hana ofosu-Appiah
(Mother): "lhe interesting
thing about my character is
that she is essentially
battling herself. She needs
to overcome her fantasy in
order to exist in her
reality.”

lloss Koml (Son): "the son
is a seventeen-year-old
hoy; he excels in school
and tries to lose himself in
his work and in plays.
Theater is his escape from a
disappointing home liie;
his mother is very
controlling and his father is
too pathetic to be any kind
of ally or role model.
Rohan Mandelia (Harry
Houdini): ”Harry Houdini
acts out the othels' altit-
egos and evil motivations.
He tan he funny and
whacky for someone and
inexorably evil for another.
He is hard to forget and
can leave a lasting imprint
in the minds of the people
he is in contact with."

a really her day and there is a popsicle hanging shove
their heads. Nett com: the face maths, Lay circles her

in the woods.

Elm): Tragedy is an open space production. “Open
Space is an opportunity for students to experiment in
tlreater— try out new ideas, discover new approachu to
making theater in the act ofdoing," Professor Shawn
womack, the project advisor, said.

“They really want you to keep it as minimalist as
possible," lay said, “open spaces aren’t about the
product; it's about tho process."

The process started when the playwright, Kyle
Schmidt ’04. took a playwriting class during his study
alarosd last semester at the National Theater lnsritutc in
Connecticut.

“We were supposed to do a kitchen sink drama," he
said, referring to a type of drama that takes place in the
home and centers on fsmily, adding, “There's supposed
to be some sort of family problem."

Everyone in the class was also assigned a historical
frgurc to add to the five page sccnc. Schmidt was
assigned Harry Houdini “i started thinking shout what
Harry Houdini does mean to a family and what he
could do." Schmidt said.

The play is about a typically dysfunctional family
“Each of them in their own way is seduced and
succumbs to the idea ofcscaping rather than facing their
problems," Lay explained. The father, played by Paul
Hcidcr ’04. is a man who has suppressed all his desires in
order to survive life. The mother, played by Ofosu.

Applah is hatrling herself, unable to live in reality. Their
son, played by Koon, is left without a role model or ally
within the home. The three ofthcm harely constitute a
family and lntemcl with each other in only the most
superficial ways, trying as hard as they can to esoapc.

“Their need to get our of this slmation is embodied
by this alluring showman who gives them otactly what
they want," Schmidt said. This alluring showman is
Harry Houdini. Mandelia portrays Houdini as a series
of minor csplosions of energy on the stage. For me other
characters he is their conscious mind talking badt. he is
their evil impulse. At the same time he is a character in
his own right whose sole purpose is selfeaggmndiumcnt
at the oosr of this famuy.

Despite its serious subject matter, drape Tragedy tries
to avoid being overbearing or heavy. “This play is a
tragedy, hot chores also a lot of humor in it," Schmidt
said.

The humor continues all through rehearsal, even
when he actors and their director get down to business.
They ere focused as they try a line that lay recently
asked Schmidt to change, outside of rehearsal, lay and
Schmidt toss lines hack and forth to improve the
dialogue. “The nice part,” lay said, “[is] ifthcrc’s ever a
problem lrke, ‘Oh I don't like this line: I can just go to
the playwright. It’s a very organic process."

Schmidt loved that his play was growing and
hecoming hotter during rehearsals. “I can look at it later
on," he said, ”and frgure out ‘This is whore I need to
improve this play, this is where this part of the writing is
weak and rt needs to be improved." A Self-oonfaslcd
control freak, Schmidt decided that this time he would
have to give up complete control of the project and let
someone else direct.

“I decided that for this play to grow and for it to go
to the next level I had to give it up." he said. Schmidt
decided that Lay's quirky sense of humor was perfect for
his piece. “I rhoughr irwould suit his play very well to
have someone at the helm who has that kind of
mentality," He said, “We already have a really good
worlong relationship," he added, “lt's just a rally nice.
open. honest thing." Rewriting lines happened several
times, especially as the actors refined their characters.

Koon and haul Herder ‘04 try the newlines and lay
asks if they feel more natural. Koon turns to her, his face

lit up, Wash, that is so much better!"

“One of the mosr important things for me is to
he able to encourage my actors to rake risks, to take
chances," lay said, “This is really experimental
thater. This is a constant conversation of What if
we do this? or What doe that look like?"

The cast and lay go over one scene repeatedly
trying to get it perfect. lay stops the actors to ask
them what their character; motivations are. Their
answers are thoughtful and realistic lay suggests
that Koon move from the couch during a oertairr
line and Koon protests that it feels more natural ifhc
shys. “Then hold. Do what feds rightp” lay tells

him.”
