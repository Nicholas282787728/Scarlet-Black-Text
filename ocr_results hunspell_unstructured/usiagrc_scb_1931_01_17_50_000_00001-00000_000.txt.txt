Faculty Approves Addition
to Curriculum of Two Art
Majors at Meeting Monday

Monday the Grinnell college faculty
Voted for the addition to the general
curriculum of two art majors, one
in history and the other in creative
art.

CouYses covering ﬁle field from
prehistoric to modern times will be
offered in the history of art
by Miss Luella Read. This will mean
the addition of courses in (118.554
ical art and art of the middle ages.
Six hours of drawing and design, un-
der the direction of Miss Edith A.
Sternfeld, will be required for a
major in the historical field.

Under creative art, courses in ele-
mentary and advanced drawing, de-i
sign, painting in watercolor and oil,‘
lettering, and commercial art will be
given by Miss Stemfeld. a mini-
mum requirement of four hcurs of
history was announced for a major
in this field.

The course in "Interior Decoration"
is open to students in both courses.

. “Art Appreciation” will be a pre-
requisite, cnd 16 hours of work in
either field will be counted a minor.‘

The new art majors have beenl
approved to meet a growing demand
for such work. in the creative field
the work to be given here, Miss
Sternfeld said, will amount to the.
full first year‘s work given in the'
best art schools of the country, and‘
she hopes to be able to arrange for
an exchange of credits.

Employment Tips

Every college woman, who plans
to enter the business world,
should learn to type at the rate of
50 words per minute and take dic—
tation at 100 words per minute.
Stenography is not a career for a
college woman, but it is a useful
tool to have in getting a foothold
in the business world.

The increasing number of col-
lege men in business, who prefer
college trained women as secre-
taries, has opened up many ammo
tive positions. in April Mrs.
Zinser of the Zinser Per-
sonnel bureau in Chicago
is coming to the campus as the
guest of the Vocations committee
of the Young Women's Christian
association to discuss opportuni-
ties for college women in Chicago.

Wylie Talk Monday Night
Before Science Students
to Be Given in Auditorium
A talk on “The Foliage Leaf" by
Prof Robert B. Wylie, head of the

University of Iowa department of
botany, will feature the regular meet-

ing of the Science club Monday eve-

ning.

Since all students of biology are
to attend the address, and since a
number of other people will wish to
hear Professor Wylie, the lecture will
be held in the auditorium of the A-
lumni Recitation hail, instead of in
the chemistry lecture room, as is us—
ual with Science club meetings.
The usual Science club supper, open
to all at a charge of 25 cents, will
be held at 6:15 in the zoological lab—
oratory on the second floor of Blair
hsli.

Prefessor' Wylie is sent to Gi-innell
by the University of Iowa to give
the annual research lecture offered
to colleges of the state. The lecture
will be illustrated with slides.

He has written several articles
during the last few years on the prob-
lem of leaves. His special field is the
cicatrization of leaves.
