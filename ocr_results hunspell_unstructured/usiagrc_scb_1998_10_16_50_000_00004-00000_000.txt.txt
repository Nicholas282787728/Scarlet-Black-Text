This weeks conversarion is wirh volleyball
co-caprain and serrer Amber Donahue 'oo.
Donahue has been playing volleyball ar
Grinnell for drree years and has been a key parr
ro rhe success of rhis year’s squad.

Scarlee and Black: can you give us a brief
synopsis ofyour life and how you got here?

Ambcr: [was born and grew up in Sourh-
ern California, in a lirrle rown called El
_chundo. I ended up ar Grinnell because rhey
railed rne ro play volleyball I had never heard
of Grinnell. When rhey called and recruired
rnc ro play, 1 looked inro rhe school and dis-
covered rhar ir has grear academics. And I gas
a chance ro play ball (here), which I never
rhoughe Iwould ger ro do. so I ended up com-
ing here.

I've played sporrs in [El Segundo] my whole
life. I played softball up unril eighrh grade. In
eighrh grade I played volleyball and have never
looked back. I gave up sofrball ro play volley-
ball.

sees: coming to a school wilh such a high
academic repuraeion, were you surprised by
the quality of rho spores program as Grinnell?

Amber; I was pleasanrly surprised by rhe
facr rhar us such a well.run program and Thai
ir is a highly comperiuve program But as rhe
same time, we (arhleres) are allowed and an—
couraged ro ger our work done. lfyou have a
paper, ifyou have an exam, rfyou have ro miss
praceice, rhe coaches are shoeing you our of
she gym ro go ger ir done. Ar rhe same rime,
we're a rhrcar in our conference in addirion ro
having such a good academic record.

Here, you play ball because you can and
because you wanr ro, nor because anyone is
leaning over here saying, “You must be here
and you musr do rhis.” And you ger a grear
educarion, so is was a really nice surprise.

5&3: Whae has your arhleric career been
like here as Grinnell?

Amber: Freshman year, we srarred out wirh
rhree serrers—rwo freshmen and a sophomore,
and I didn’r play very much ar rhe beginning
of rho season. Then in our firsr conference
march I Went in and ﬁnally played like I can,
and rhen ir srarred ro gee berrer and berrer fresh-
man year: We played prerry well considering
we had never played (ogcrlicr; almosr rhe Cn-
rire ream was freshmen—mere were like if)
freshmen, rwo sophomores and a senior.

Sophomore year we all came back and
srarred offwirh Coach Sonnichsen, who is rhe
currenr coach. We rook rhe ralenr rhar we had
and rurned ir inro rhe roam rhar we have now.

This season, rm so surprised as how well
rm playing. But because my job as a serrer is
dependenr on how my reamrnares pass ro me,
and since this ream passes really well, i can
srarr runningsruff. he really dependenron my
reammares. But every year I've gorren sreadily
berrer, and us so much fun, I can’t even dc-
scribe how much fun ir is; I've never played
like rhis in my life. lr's really fun.

53ch How has rhis season been going?

Amber: lr's been like an our-ofbody expe-
rience. l'vc been kind ofwarchlng rhis season
rhinking, “Oh my goshl" It's hard in explain.
As a senor, rhe common analogy is rher I'm
rho quarrcrback ofrhe ream. Bur ifyour doing
your job (as aserrer), rhen nobody really should
norice you. They should be seeing rhe hirrers

up rhere wailing away. They should be look.
a

ing ae rhar awesome dig. So rhe serrer is kind
ofrhe inrermediarc rhar nobody norices. Bur
Ehaf’: fine wirh me, because rhar iusr means
I‘m doing my job. And rhis year, ro be recog-
nizcd as many rimes as l have been, has been
kind ofsurprrsing,,.Bur 1 can’r do my job un»
less my passcrs are doing rheir jobs, so rhars
where it’s coming from, ehe whole ream rhing.

8&3: When you are noe playing volley-
ball, whar do you like so do?

Amber: play volleyball. We had a rhree-
day weekend rhis weekend, and four ofus were
playing in rhesand courrs on Sourh campus.

I do my homework. I do like (0 read. I’ve dis-
covered rhar I love ro swing dance, so I’m rry.
ing ro learn how ro do rhar. I love going so
rhc movies. When rm as home, because home
in sourhern California is rhe beach, so 1 go
down ro rhe beach,,,i like playing in the sand.
When I’m nor playingindoorvolleyball, I like
playing sand volleyball.

SBLB: What’s your maior?

Amber: l’m a bio major.

5&3: How did you gee imo that?

Amoer: I done know. When i came here,
I rhoughr rhar l mighr do wrieing or some-
rhing like rhar. Parrially because of (h: New
Science Eroiccr, 1 gor ro know (biology prop
fcssor) Clark Lindgren and people'in rhe Sci-
ence deparrmenr. Then i rook workshop bio
my freshman year wirh Clark, and is was so
much fun. Bio was always somerhing ro me
rhar I could rake because ir was always inrcr—
cseing and made sense, bur i never rhoughr
abour doing ir. The more I rook rr, rhc more
i liked undersranding how sruff worked and
why...i've orrned more and more inro a sci-
ence major as rune has gone on. When I rake
philosophy classes, I rhink, “Aaalil Lee’s do an
esperimear on rhis." 1 wanr ro nuanrify eve
eryrhing.

S&B:Whnr do you plan eo do when you
graduarez

Ambcr: l have no idea. I'll sray in sciences.
But I’m taking all rhese bio classes, and every
one 1 take I rhink, “Oh, rhar would be fun ro
do."so iris kind ofhard ro decide.

ir has occurred so me before, because I love
generics, rhar is would be cool ro work in per
lice labs or FBI labs working wirh generics. I
rhink rhar would be a worrhwhile applicarion
ofeveryrhrng I’ve learned...

Bur l srill have bio classes iefr ro rake. I‘m
raking virology righr now. and if’s fascinaring,
so my plans could change. But i do rhink grad
school would be nieeenor med school bur
grad school. I'd be rho ﬁrsr person in my fam-
ily ro end upwirh somerhinglike rhar so rhar
would be cool. Dr. Donahue would be nice.

sees: Crear. Anyehing else you wane to
add?

Amber: There are only a couple of [vol—
leyhall players} who have been named in rhe
I ofus TlllS
wood for

arricles rhis year, bur rher
ream would nor be whar i
everybody dam is rlrere ar pracrice everyday,
The reason that we do so well is because We
ployagainsr ourselvesar pracrice. Halfrlro rime
our second ream rhar we're playing agarnsr is
herrer rhan rhe ream rhar you're seeing ..

This is rhe grearesr group of people We
ever played ball wirh. They're my beer friends
and agroup ol‘excellenr, compclirivc, Sports»
man like arhleres. Everybody on our rcam
deserves a loe ofcredrr.
