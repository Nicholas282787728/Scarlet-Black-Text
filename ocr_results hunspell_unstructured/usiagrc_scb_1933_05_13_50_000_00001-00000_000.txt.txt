Bank Waiver '
Plan Changed

by Depositors

lTrust Fund Not Limited;

' Campus Groups Among
‘ Interested Parties.

At a meeting of depositors of the
Grinncll State bank last night a new
proposal, concerning the waiver cam
paign and approved by the state
banking department, was submitted
and adopted.

Sixteen Grinncll college campus
groups are involved in the waiver
plan because of their deposits in the
bank totaling 52,500.

Favors Depositors

The proposal, a change in the
statement of the waiver, according to
officials of the bank, is favorable to
the depositors. The original waiver
stated that the total amount paid
into the trust fund should not ex-
ceed a sum equal to 100 per cent of
the capital stock of the bank, where-
as the waiver now states t, t t.e
amount paid into the trust fund
should not exceed a sum equal to
100 per cent of the principal sum of
the trust certificates. This does not
limit the amount which may be
placed in the trust fund.

The meeting of depositors re-
solved: “That it be the consensus of
this depositor’s meeting;

Believed Best Plan

“1. That it is very necessary to
the welfare of the community that
the Crimson state bank be opened
for regular business at the earliest
possible date:

"2. That we, the depositors at this
meeting, believe that, all things con-
sidered and under the conditions in
which the bank finds itself, the re-
lvised depositors agreement, as read
by our chairman, is the best plan
lfor accomplishing such reopening
and affords the depositors the max-
‘ll'num of protection;

l ”3. That in view of these facts we
approve the signing of these revised
depositors agreements and, where
‘posslble, will cooperate with the of-
,ficers at the bank and the working
‘committes in securing additional
signatures to these agreements.”

Grass Takes Part

The bank officials announced yes-
terday that anyone who has signed
,one of the original waivers will au-
ltomatically be put on record as sign-

I
l
l

‘lug the new waiver, unless that de-
‘positor objects.

D. F. Grass, professor of business
administration, took a prominent

 

.tition for the Henry York Steincr part at the meeting of the depositors
lprize. rThey are being judged by ada

ilast night and was appointed to the
,committee to represent the deposi-
.torS in future dealings with the bank
officials.

According to the officials of the
lGrinnell State bank, depositors will
‘be assured of an immediate payment
of 2s per cent, upon opening of the
lbank, if the present waiver campaign
is successful.
