What characterizes the political at-
mosphere at a small college in the corn
fields of Iowa’! Al‘ter interviewing
representatives of the Republican,
Socialist, and Democratic groups at
Grinnell the answer appears to be a strong
commitment towards increasing political
awareness by emphasizing student par-
ticipation in political events.

In an attempt to include all nationally
recognized partisan political groups on
campus we did Contact the Citizen's Party,
but Carol Whitehouse, last year's
organizer. explained that the group is no
longer active and will not hold an
meetings. ,

immediately upon sitting down lor his
interview. Paul T, Carter, president ol the
College Republicans emphasized that,
“We‘ve hit the ground running " He said,
"This year about 30 people can be counted
on once in a while, about 10-15 individuals
are very active and there are those who
are arraid to admit they are Republicans
because or the liberal climate on campus."

Carter noted, however, that because this
is not an election year, it is difficult to
judge whether students are more
politically inclined. Nevertheless. he said,
“More people are attending our meetings
this year, even though our group is
becoming less issue-oriented and more
academic in focus "

An example oi the more academic ape
proach being taken is the club's series of
discussion Sessions planned for this year
called Issues for the 'élﬂs Carter described
the purpose of this series as ”to discuss
Specialized issues such as defense,
economics, arts, the past election, and the
Supreme Court, among other topics. We
hope to stimulate discussion, however, not
Republican dogma. We want to educate
people through the speaker's knowledge
and to hear each others' opinions on these
issues "

The group has already held one suc-
cessfiil discussion With H, Wayne Moyer,
associate professor oi political science,
speaking on “America’s Defense Posture
and the Reagan Administration." Carter
cmphastzed that “Constdcring it has skip
day evc, almost 30 people attended "

Other events planned by the group in-
clude getting Such possible speakers on
campus as Governor Bob Ray,
Congressman Jim Leach, and Leiutenant
tlovernor Bi'andstad and having a debate
either with the democrats or with an
outside individual or group.

Finally, Carter outlined the group’s
tentative plan to develop a Rape Counr
Seling Session. “We are interested in
getting the Poweshiek County Attorney,
the Chief of Police, a town doctor, an RA ,
a health center nurse, and someone from
student affairs to work together on this
project. This will foster a more community
service aspect to the group in addition to
our political focus," he said.

Although the Democratic Socialist
Organizing Committee lbs QC.) on
campus has a radically ditierent political
ideology than the republicans, its size and
focus are similar. D.S.o.c. at Grinnell is
not officially part ol the national chapter.
out only loosely affiliated with the New
York ottice.

Kate Jackson, who along with Liz
Waters chairs 0.3.0 c, said that “About
:10 people are interested in the group and
about to are active members." This
number has remained constant since the
group was formed in 197980,

This year D.S.O C's general focus is on
political education from a socialist
viewpoint, but not solely on party platform
dogma. Jackson explained that “We are
planning to have professors come trom the
lowa City chapter of D S.O.C. lor
discussions: to have movies about multi~
national corporations and the economic
policies in other countries: to have some
discussions and open forums, and to have
an information table to inform students
What D.S U,C does on a nationwide
scale ” But, above all of these activities.
Jackso ii emphasized that the group has
received a $1000 grant from the Rnsenfield
Program to bring Michael Harrington,
who has been active in socialist politics
Since the 1950’s and who is presently a
professor and National Chair of D S,O.C ,
on campus second Semester A date has
not been set yet because Harrington
refuses to fly or cross picket lines until
the P A T.C.0 strike is settled,

In closing, Jackson remarked, “I think a
lot or people on campus are scared oi us.
however, because of the word socialist in
our name A lot ol people would find.
however, that their political behels are
quite similar to ours 'i

The democratic group on campus is not
complctcly organized this semester
because of a lack oi student leadership.
According to Kevin Crim, Chair of
Poivcshiclt County Democratic Central
Committee, assistant in the Writing
Laboralory and lecturer. “A meeting is
planned lor October 15.” Crim expects a
large lurllrnut because Slate Represen-

tativeJanet Carlof Grinnell, State Senator
Joe Brown, and County Recorder Bev
Mallory will attend. “At this meeting,"
Crim said, “we will tormulate our plans
tor the year. elect campus leadership
leaders and elect 2 people to the central
committee in town."

This year Crim expects the group to
focus its attention on the economy, natural
resources in iowa, ioreign affairs, and
social issues. When asked how he per-
ceived Student involvement in politics, and
in particular with the democratic party.
Crim responded, “More people are
becoming involved, but it can only in»
crease because the current administration
in Washington is undertaking pretty heavy
changes'in national life. They claim to
havea mandate in the last election and it's
ratuous, They've got supply side
economics and it won't work The socalled
budget cuts isn't a budget cut, but a
massive reallocation of social programs
The military program is questionable in
terms oineed and eiiicacy. As time passes
people Will increasingly see these people
don’t have the answer. It won‘t work,"

Crim concluded his overall assessment
of politics more optimistically However,
he said, “Iowa is a good place to tinker in
politics because we have the caucus, not a
primary election system, Besides,
Grinnell has a long and fine tradition in
democratic politics.”

According to Jim Goodicllow. Chair of
the Political Activities Support Fund
{P.A.S,F ). however, “If lhesc three
groups are not responsive to students my
group will takea more active role in his
creasmg student political awareness"
With a budget of $1500 for this year.
F A.S r. helps groups like the
Republicans. Socialists, and Democrats
meet the costs involved in bemg politically
active Gnodiellow noted. hoiicver, that
“So far this semester I have not received
any requests for money " Nevertheless,
Goodlellow hopes that the political groups
presently on campus “will emphasize
student participation so that students
become morc politically aware and ac-
live."

Thus. it appears that political activity at
Grinncll will not be solely relegated this
semester to passing comments about
budget cuts in the loggia or to late night
bull sessions about the MX missile in the
pub, The locus oi the College Republicans
Socialists and the Democrats, emr
phasizing student participation in politiai
events. suggests a strong committineiit lo
iiircasiiig political awareness at ariimril.
