Labor Unions

Social Legislation

Progress Reviewed
By Hull-House Head

labor respectable, it is funda-
mental to democracy," stated
Charlotte E. Carr in Herrick chap-
el last night in her address on
"Steps in Attaining an American
Standard of Living."

Miss Carr, who succeeded Jane
Addams at the famed Hull-House

the efforts and achievements of
her generation in bringing about
the adoption of such social legis-
lation os Won-(men’s compensation
laws, unemployment insurance and
old-age pensions. “We haven't
yet started to acquire the Amerie
can standard of living."

Miss .Carr praised the work of
the W.P.A. "Harry Hopkins as
administrator," she stated, "by
keeping wages from going to a

, horrible bottom, has done more
to hold up the standards of la~
bor than any other person in the
government administration. And,"
she continued, "he will be the
first Secretary of Commerce
whose name will be remembered

 

a year after he leaves office."

fob Surveyors Return from Chicago
Optimistic Over Reception by Employers

Chicago job surveyers brought
back an encouraging report of the
reception of industry to the annu»
al Grinnell job survey.

Students who interviewed em-
ployers last week while on the
tour found businessmen looking
for college graduates with aggress
sive personalities, in good health,
prepared to work hard and willing
to start at the bottom with a
small salary.

“Most encouraging was the at—
titude of employers toward the
project," commented G. Lester
Duke, personnel director. The im—
portance in the eyes of many cm-
ployers of extracurricular activi-
ties of the college man in order
to develop qualities of leadership
was consistently brought up.

To Establish

Residence in

Grinnell Soon

Huffman Granted
Absence Leave to
Teach at Cleveland

Harry L. Hopkins, ‘12, secre-
tary of commerce, was ap-
pointed a member of the
Gi'innell college board of trus-
tees by that body at its meet-
ing here April 3.

Eleven Alumni.

He will fill one of the two va-
cancies which have existed on the
board for some time, bringing to
eleven the number of alumni now
represented in the group, The
hope was expressed by members of
the college administration and stu-
dent body that Hopkins would con-
sent to be a guest lecturer at Grin-
neli, much as President Roosevelt
is at Harvard.

Shortly after the announcement
of his appointment, Hopkins ex-
pressed his intention to establish
residence in Crinnell and to rear
his daughter here.

Grants Absence Leave.

The board also continued the
appointment of Pres. John S. No1-
len of G. Lester Duke as director
of personnel. It extended by an»
other year the leave of absence
granted last year to L. C. Douglas,
assistant professor of psychology,
who has been doing special work
at the University of Iowa during
the past year, and granted F. Wei»

The audience will act as judges
and will cast their votes by means
of ballots which will be distribut—
ed by ushers.

Those speaking and the subs
jecLs on which they will speak
include Browne Barr speaking on
"In Times Like These:” Robert
Dane whose subject is “War Is
a Racket;" Ralph Lulckart, “Your
Suicirlei” Charles Bear, “Want
Some Sea Food” and Howard
Townsend, “Address Unknown.”

 

iness man determine the personal-
ity of the applicant.

An analysis of individual re
ports substantiated the feeling
that the majority of employers
desire college men because of
superior training. The chief ob-
jection found with college grad-
uates by the interviewers was
that they are too "choosey" in
regard to a position and many
have an exaggerated opinion of
their worth to biisinoss as begin—
lners.

Over 400 interviews with 100
different firms wcrc granted durr
ing the termination of the trip
to Chicago. Many interviews pro.
lvided valuable contacts and po-
tential leads for positions later.
