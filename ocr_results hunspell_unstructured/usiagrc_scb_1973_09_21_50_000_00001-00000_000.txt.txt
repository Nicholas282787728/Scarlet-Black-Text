‘ facing the college where change and
attention are warranted. The future
of admissmns topped his list, folr
lowed by the problem of homogen-
iety ot the student body iorced by
academic and iinancial selection,
and establishment of interdiscipli»
date the needs caused by indepen-
dent maiors for such programs.
Walker expressed a concern with
the success and failure of the no
requirement curriculum. The dis-
tribution of students in classes has
not been affected by lifting of re—
quirements, but Walker commented
that there has been discussion of
the long range problem or tenure
bound departments created by the
lift. N0 requirements are troublev
some in some areas such as writing
composition which was iormely re
quired. Because Grinnell is a“wri»
ting college” without this require—
ment produces Students not as well
qualified in writing skills, Walker
explained.

Adding an interim session to the
college calendar and improving and
studying oii campus study programs
were other aspects oi worry to the
dean. In relation to off campus stu-
dy. Walker described the programs
as ranging from “superb to very,
very poor," adding that a need for
assessment of these programs and
their worthiness to receive Grin—
nell credit are necessary.

Faculty work load was mentioned
as an important part of administrate
tive worry due to the overload cauSA
ed by independent projects especi-
ally but also by committees, adVISr
ing, and teaching, The work load
has increased by four or iivetimes,
according to Walkerr Possible solu-
tions would he elimination of some
courses or reduction of indepen-
dent projects. Walker suggested.
Last on Walker’s list was the need
for risk funds or venture capital to
allow the college to experiment
with new ideas. It is necessary to
have a pool of money to fall back

on in order to do Such experiment»
ation, Walker concluded.

Dean oi Admissions Nicholas Ryan,
the. next speaker, expressed the
need to increase the applicant pool
and its diversity, with a special
effort concentrated in lOWa. involve
ment or iaculty by writing or call—
ing prospectives who express an
interest in a particular department
Ryan believes will aid the admi-
ssions situation. Grinnell has Joined
the College Entrance Examination
Board program which has high
school students fill out questiona
naires which are then matched with
the colleges which correspond to
the students preferences and his
name is sent to those colleges.
.Grinnell will receive 12,000 of
these names and will make mailr
ings to these students. Ryan quoted
some of the most frequent reasons
given for students deciding not to
come to Grinnell after acceptance
which included reasons such as
”too isolated," “too small,” ”too
tense," ”too much of a coat and
tie school," “lack of romance,”
and “excess emphasis on academ—
ics."

Dean of Student Affairs, Jim Te-
derman, described the general. tone
on campus prefacing his comments
with a notation that it was diffi-
cult to tell so early in the year.
He said that the campus is unu-
sually quiet, the library is busy,
and social and political issues are
receiving very little attention. Slur
dents, Tederman said, seem to be
centering on internal problems of
personal comfort more than exter-
nal conflicts. The health service,
the lack of a physician, dissatisfac-
tion with SAGA, housing, and prie
vacy are the areas he noted as of
chief worry to students. -

Preoccupation with self concepts
and how to relate to others domi-
nates students worries. he stated.
Loneliness is cited by Tederman
as a large problem denoted by stu-
dents in a survey taken last year.
Students claimed they were lonely
because they lacked time fortriends
and a social life due to the “aca-
demic pressure cooker atmos
phere” which Tede‘rman attributed
to the fault of the students and the
college. The difficulty of communi-
cating with each other is due to
lack of a formal structure of eas-
ing into relationships Tedermanbee
lleves.

on projects.
