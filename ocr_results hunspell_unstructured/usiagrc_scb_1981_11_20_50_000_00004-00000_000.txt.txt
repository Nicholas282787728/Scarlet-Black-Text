Is a law
.Unlll you Ignore It

At Wednesday’s Joint Board meeting Mark Salmanson, chairman of
the Student Rules Committee (SRC), read a three and a half page
prepared statement. The topic of the statement was SRC’s response to
the article in last week’s edition of the 58:13 which pointed out that both
the election of SGA President Doug Rowe and the appointment of the
members to Judicial Council were invalid, Salmanson explained that it
was the role of SRC to render an opinion and offer a recommendation to
the SGA cabinet. In effect, the main points of the statement were as
follows:

0 That the points brought to bear in the Nov. 13th issue of the S&B
concerning the president and Judicial Council were true.

I That SRC agrees Rowe’s election was in violation of the SGA cons
stitution but that it doesn’t violate the “spirit" of the constitution since
Rowe was elected by the majority of the students (Actually, Rowe was
elected by votes of only 199 students.)

0 That by declaring Rowe’e election invalid the entire SGA “struc-
ture" would, therefore, be invalid also. Since this would would disrupt
and “complicate” the workings of SGA, SRC’s recommendation was to
have Rowe continue as president

0 That the Judicial Council was to be approved by President George
Drake to fulfill its designated function. To that point a letter was sub
mitted by Salmanson from Drake gianting power to Judicial Council.

Salmanson finished reading the statement, there was no discussion
of the SRC’s recommendation, and boom, case closed. The meeting
continued and there was no further discussion of the matter until a mo-
tion was made at the end of the meeting to make Rowe and all his ac-
tions as president valid. The motion was passed by Joint Board.

What all this means is that both the SGA Cabinet and Joint Board
have decided to totally ignore the question at hand. That is, do we or do
we not obey the current constitution?

We find this decision quite interesting. In essence, they are saying,
“to hell with the SGA Constitution, right now it‘s just not convenient."
What an amazing concept. When the guidelines don’t suit your needs at
the moment, ignore the guidelines. We then have to ask what is the
point of establishing guidelines in the first place',7 In other words, why
have a constitution at all if nobody is planning to abide by it?

We‘re not implying that we think any of the characters involved in

this story are trying to be sneaky or dishonest, rather, it just appears -

that no one seems to care, There has been an obvious violation of the
constitution and yet it seems that SGA is content to sit back and let it
go.
Salmanson said that it‘s SRC’s role to interpret the constitution We
must state our disagreement with their interpretation To say that
because Rowe’s election was invalid so too would be the entire “struc-
ture” of SGA, seems foolish. All other members of the cabinet were
either elected legally or were confirmed by Joint Board, so the only
position that is in question is the president’s. Therefore, the entire SGA
“structure” would not collapse with the departure 'of its president.
We believe that the appropriate action would be for Rowe to step
down as president of SGA Then, either a new election could be held or
the current SGA vice—president could fill the president’s position for the
remainder of the year. This action would, at least, show some respect
for the constitution. According to the present constitution, Rowe’s
presidency is invalid. Why does SGA refuse to respond to this fact?
As for Judicial Council, it seems that matter has been settled by
Drake. But again, the point remains, nobody really seems to be
bothered by the fact that die rules of the constitution were clearly
broken.
Well, it looks like student apathy has reached its peak here. What can
, we say but to acknowledge what a sad commentary on SGA this is By
not following the rules, the players are simply doing nothing more than
playing a game. -

A couple of comparisons

Somebody asked me recently why I
haven‘t written anything for the paper in a
long time, i don't know about you, but to
me that constitutes “popular demand." So
I've decided to come out of retirement and
once again pound away at the computer
terminal.

It was kind of hard to believe at first, but
I have actually met some people who
believethat one canstillmake originaland
humorous remarks about the food here,
The key word is “original ” I thought
everybody knew that any joke that could
be made on this subject has been told for
years.

We all know that Fran Lebowitz is die
greatest living American humorist. What
we all might not know is that she has come
out with a new book (Social Studies, Ran-
dom House, 147 pgs.). Here‘s an example
of her wit from this book. ‘

“Stand firm in your refusal to remain
conscious during algebra class, because I
assure you, in real life, there is no such
thing as algebra.”

Now to make the use of that quote
legitimate, I will use it as a lead in to a
discussion on math. You see, a few weeks
ago, I wrote some less than complimenr
tary remarks on various majors but left
mathematics untouched. So, rather than
leave myself open to (founded) accusa-
tions of playing favorites, I will say this:

I'm the one writing the column, it doesn't
matter whether it is the first thing that cat-
ches your eye or not) are math books, Or,
more specifically, the titles okmath books.

awhile,

probably the most infuriating aspect 0
math is the proof. The books (and pro
fessors) will tell us (even though we kno
better) that the proof of one thing 0
another is “trivial” or “obvious" or “835)

later will be thrilled beyond human con

Recently, I had cause to use what i
believe to be a very wise quotation. Alte
awhile, i started wondering whethe
anyone had ever said it before. So on th
outside chance that i am me one who in
vented this quotation, Iam publishing it s
it may always be attributed to me.

So here it is:

1205 Park Sllll'v III'IIIIIDIS

To the Editor:

I realize that few members of our cams
pus community are up for yet another let
ter finding fault with our scarlet and
Black. But Marilyn Clark's intriguing (to
say the leastl journalistic techniques pro
vide such a marvelously ironic counterr
point to the “joumalistic ethics" editorial
that i cannot resist a short obiter dictum

regarding last week's cover story.

To recap the situation for those of you
who may have inadvertently received your
facts from the 5&8, the members of our
CO-Op house at 1205 Park Street were
charged by the administration with breaks
ing into Loose and Mears Halls, stealing
furnitureand using the house attic (off-
limits due to fire hazards). As punishment
for these offenses, the college proposed
that all members of the house not be allows
ed to live in the coop next semester — but
did not rule out the possibility of
negotiating another settlement, (It was
eventually decided that any those involved
in the incidents would be asked to move
out.)

The members of the house were
understandably apprenhensive about
making the issue public before it was
resolved, and hence all of the residents
declined to talk with the 5&8 when can-
tacted by Ms. Clark. But the 5&3 persisted
with a barrage of badgering phone calls
replete with threats that the story would be
printed with or without our input. Having
been an 5&8 editor, I realize that the
newspaper does have “a responsibility to
report the news" and it was largely on ac-
count of my proddings that we granted Ms.
Clark an interview. Several house
members still had misgivings about
coopr‘ating with the SSA}. but I convinced
them that it could only be to our advantage
to tell our side of this rather sensitive
issue.

During the course of the interview.

several members of the house asked not t
be quoted. Ms. Clark, however, obviously
felt that they had something to say: mos
of their statements appeared in her arti
cle. And instead of using the trite and
hackneyed device of “Said a member a
the house who wished to remain
anonymous" a so prevalent in ourcurren
era of post-Watergate journalism 7 Ms.
Clark adopted an innovative'technique:
she attributed all of these quotations to
me! ,

In all fairness, I do recollect saying one
thing vaguely reminiscent of what Ms
Clark assignedto me: My point was that i
there was indeed reasonable fear for th-
life, safety and health of member of th
house, why was it that the college did nol
act from the time that the night watchma
entered the house to investigate the light i i
the attic (Friday night) until Lhe tim
when a bevy of BhGers arrived to remov
the furniture and seal off the attic on Mon
day afternoon. Quoath Ms. Clark: ” ‘lf th—
attic was presenting an lmmediat
danger, why didn't the night watchmar
come into the house ' Friday?’ aske-
Rasmussen." I suppose I should b
thankful that she did get half of my condi
tional correct. (For those of you who ar
interested, Mr. Tederman provided In
with the pragmatic answer: “It was th
weekend”) »

It isn't necessary to elaborate furthe
examples of mis—quoting (although I do ob
ject to being accredited with the rather ab
surd logic that members of the house di-
not really “break into the dorm" becaus
“they gained entry by climbing through a
open window"); suffice it to say that few
if any, of Ms. Clark‘s quotations are cor
rect (“What is ‘financial damage
anyway? asked a bewildered Don Mon
tgomery to whom me quotation had beer
assigned). Nor is it necessary to expoun-
upon the factual errors which aboun
