Fine Program Given Despite

too Many Concerts, Critic Finds

‘Volg‘a Boat Song’ Done
Especially Well
by Cossacks

By Richard Kuncl

In sombre black tunics with side
panels of red, the Don .Cossack
chorus gave the audience WellneSr
day night a program of plcasant
and real entertainment in Herrick
chapel. The program was distinctly
Russian, and satisfied the general
American idea of what constitutes
Russian music . . . the booming
bass voices . . , the crescendocs
ending in double fortes . . . the
extraordinary verve and strength
display. ‘

The high falsettos of the tenors
were awesome early in the,pror
gram, but became somewhat wears
ing toward the end. The strain of
a good deal of recent singing
showed before the program had
progressed far; inevitable harsh-
ness from heavy work was plain,
especially because the singers
were almost constantly perform»
ing in full voice, making the rough»
ness more obvious.

Plans Completed
for Freshmen
Date-Dinner

Final preparations for the ans
nual freshmen date-dinners, to be
held Wednesday evening, were
made by the Council of House
Presidents at their weekly meeting
last Thursday night.

All freshmen who regularly eat
at the dormitory dining room will
be required to attend the dinner.
All first year men who do not have
dates by Monday night are to get
in touch with John Hess, general
chairman of the dinner, who will
secure dates for the men.

The council also discussed plans
for an intra-house smoker, but no
definite decision was made,

Frosh study hall will be held ev-
ery evening beginning Monday
night for those freshmen who have
failed to maintain a c average for
the first month's work, Jack Kel-
sey, chairman of the committee on
study hall arrangements, an-
nounced Friday.

Prep Gridders to Play
‘Tulor Freshmen

The Grinnell freshman football
team will play the Iowa State
Teachers preps on Nov. 18 at a
p. m, at Cedar Falls, according to
an announcement made Friday by
coach John c. Truesdale.

This will be the first game for
the frosh. and is the only game
scheduled to date, although Coach
Truesdale is negotiating for other
games.

program, “Credo" by Kastalsky,
was impressive because of the
great depths to which the bosses
sang. emphasizing their remark-
able range. Lvovsky's "Have
Mercy on Us, 0 God!" exemplified
precision and excellent control in
the constant repetition of one
phrase. first descending and then
ascending the scale. The certain,
requisite dogrcc of finesse for this
selection's interpretation was apr
parent and the swift movement of
the singing increased its attrac-
tiVenESS.

Perhaps the number done best
from an artistic point of view, but
appreciated less because of its fa-
miliarity, was the “Volga Boat
Song." There was certainly justi-
fication for an encore. The slow
floating away into nothingness of
the boatmen‘s voices was a direct
compliment to the singers' abilities
as musicians. The selection was
truly an aesthetic accomplishment,
and should have received unre—

strained applause from the listen-
ers.

Peasant Songs Popular

The ”Russian Peasant songs"
lwere tremendously. popular. par-
ticularly because they were amus—
ing and highly entertaining. Broad
smiles and downright laughter
lwere much in evidence While these
rustic melodies were sung.

The “Old Cossack Song," used as
the final number, was good for the
rounding out of n already forceful
program, and in addition, the Rus.
sian dancing helped to climax the
evening, creating a theatrical at-
mosphere, however. A thoroughly
exciting evening 'was experienced
by Grinnellians; it is not often that
i an organization of this type or
calibre reaches us.

Debate Squad '

Edith Lorand
to Appear
Thursday

Noted Wioman Conductor
to Lead ‘Orchestra

in Concert

Edith Lorand and her Hungarian
orchestra will appear Thursday
evening in Herrick chapel as the
next feature on the Grinnell col-
lege artist’s recital course. The
program will begin at 8:00 O'CIUCk.

The unusual part of the per-
formance of this orchestral of 15
men is that Mlle. Lorand fills the
dual role of conductor and solo
Violinist. Graduated from the End
apest Conservatory of Music at
the age of 17, she was awarded a
professor's diploma in recognition
of her exceptional accomplish-
ments.

Make 200,000 Records

She and her orchestra have giv-
en more than 400 concerts through<
out Europe and have made over
200,000 phonograph records, is-
number of which have had a sale
of more than a million each.

She has played as solo violinist
with ever-y major European or-
chestra, has had several radio en-
gagements. made musical films
and arranged quantities of Hun-
garian music for concert perform-
ances.

Mlle. Lorand finds that Ameri-
cans know little about Hungarian
music and has often heard many
Hungarian tunes credited to the
Viennese and many Viennese mel-
odies credited to the gypsies. one
thing that shocked her was to
watch what was supposed to be
an Hungarian ballet, in costumes
that were half Bavarian and half
Spanish, p
To Give Varied Program

It is her ambition on this, her
first Visit to the United States, to
make the people of this country
know and understand Hungarian
music, Her orchestra, however,
presents a program covering mu-
sic of every kind.

Dibble Defeats Gates
in Speedball, 12-1

Dibble hall, looking like the
team that ran off with the speed<
ball title last year, came back
Wednesday night and downed
Gates by an overwhelming score of
12-1.

The scoring for Dibble was even-
ly divided. Dean and Roderneyer
each contributed a field goal, while
Weatherson, Blaikie and Leachman
caught passes to count for the re-
maining six points. The Gates
score came on a free kick by De
Wind.

The game was rough all the way
and after the first few minutes
the question was one of how many
points Dibble could score before
the final whistle. ’
