However, the loss of several star
players from the title aggregation
hasmade the outlook for the Tigers
doubtful, especially in a combat with
a team as much out of their class as
is Crinnell.
’ Phelps and Dresser, ends, are both
letter men and capable wingmen, es-
pecially on the defense. Both are
adept forward pass receivers.

At the tackles, Barton and Sand-

with Benin," Campbell, and Hingsl:
liable to get a chance to show their
stuff. Sandberg last year was a mem-
ber of the second all»cnnference
team, while Barton received honore
able mention,
Capt. Merle Benson and either
.Hingst or Davidson will hold down
the guard positions. Benson is an all-
conference man, Hingst weighs 200
pounds, and Davidson is the best de-
tensive guard on the Methodist ﬁeld
at the present time.

Lytton Praises
Night Football

Opening Here‘

The Scarlet and Black received an.
other communication from a Mls~
souri Valley conference official this
afternoon congratulating Crinnell
upon installing projectors for night
football on Word held,

E. C, Lytton, business manager of
Drake university and Iowa manager
for Cahill Brothers of New York
City, who were the manufacturers
of the lights erected on Ward ﬁeld,
expresses the interest that Drake
has in the new lights which will be
used tonight for the game between
Iowa Wesleyan and GrlImell.

He writes: “It is a great thing for
Crinnell, and other members of the
Missouri Valley conference. that
floodlights are being installed on
Ward field. This equipment will
doubtless make it possible for many
thousands of citizens to see football
games who never have an opportun-l
ity in daylight; and the additional
receipts resulting from the larger
crowd will help Grlunell's athletic
treasury, always welcome news for
any educational institution,

“All of us at Drake are greatly in-
terested in Crinnell's success, and
hope the new equipment for night
football will mean a great deal to
the Pioneers.”

Little Gla‘res
From the
Lights

By WALTER WRIGHT
A melee of fumbling, onersided
panting, and incompleted passes
marked the first game under the
floodlights last night, but a large
audience got its first taste of night
football. Everyone was enthused

over it.

nos

Roosevelt's 7-0 win was Well
deserved and the score probably
would have been still more one—
sided, but for incomplete passes
ovcr the goal line and unlucky
plays.

s s r.

Many spectators looked to see his
honor, Mayor Ray, miss the ball
when he officially kicked off. But
he didn't. He raised the oval for a
proper and respectable ten yards.

s s 3

Half hearted speculation turned
to enthluissm when the battery
of 48,000 candle power was turn-
ed on just before the kickoff.
Many thought that half the lights
would be plenty of illumination
for a game.

r 4: r

The Grinnell American legion
drum and bugle corps made an im~
presslve appearance. The martially
clad musicians filled the time be-
tween halves with plenty of har-
mony. The Crinnell high band also
played.

a e v

coach “Fuzz" Watt, who was
onc of the officials, was kept busy
trading ends on account of num-
erous fumbles which were recov-
ered hy the othcr team.

a s

The Little Pioneers tried hard and
made some good gains at times, but
it was generally conceded they were
too light for Roosevelt.

zws

Overcoats and blankets were much
in evidence due to the cold weather.

.Night games, however, are expected

to be much colder than games played
when the Sun is shining on the field.

Douglas Hayes and Donald Jones,
last year graduates, have enrolled
at Harvard.

 

Annual Torchlight Parade
Heralds Wesleyan-Grinnell
Gridiron Contest Tonight

The annual torchlight parade will
precede the football game at Ward
ﬁeld tonight between Iowa Wesleyan
and Grinnell, '

Students will meet north of Cot-
tage Five, near the swimming pool,
at 7 tonight and march down town
carrying lighted torches. The fresh-
man band, consisting of about 20
pieces and organized by Prof. J. M.
Bridghsm last week, will lead the
parade on a truck.

Yells will be given at street inter-
sections and the parade will return
to Ward ﬁeld about 7:20 o'clock.

The YMCA. and the YWCA.
heretofore have had charge of the
torchlight, which was usually held
on the Friday evening before the
general reception. The student coun»
cil is in charge this year, and James
Clarke, secretary, is the committee

Governing Group to Decide
Wl'len Student Abuses

Hour Privilege

"A board of policies rather than a
board of penalties." Leta Rlniker
designated the 1930-31 Women’s self
government league board at a mass
meeting of Grinnell college women,
held Wednesday evening in the lit—
tle theater.
This year's league board aims at a
less disciplinary, yet a more effective
form of government, according to its
president.
No Accumulation System

The closing hours of the quad-
rangle will he as before, 11:30 p.m.
on Saturdays and 10:30 on Friday
nights. The regular 10 o'clock hours
will be in effect on week nights.
Those girls who attend open houses
at the dormitories on Friday nights
will be allowed 11 o’clock hours.

There will be no accumulation sys-
tem of minutes as was followed last
year. The board will keep a record
of the minutes which each student
uses over hours, however, but will
take no action until one of the girls
abuses the privilege too frequently.
The board will then warn the offend-
ing student, and further offences
will bring a penalty.

Dates chhl Tomorrow

The quadrangle girls will obtain
out-of»tnwn permission from their
house mothers instead of from the
dean of women this year. In order
that girls may obtain permission to
stay in town over night, the mother
in town must telephone to Miss
Luella J. Head, dean of women, or in
her absence the appropriate cottage
hostess.

New Tryouts Announced

teaser, announced this afternoon that
a second meeting of those wanting
to try for vacancies on the humor
staff of the magazine Will be held in
room 222 of the Alumni Recitation
hall at 1:10 p,m. Monday. Because
of the freshman men kinking torches
yesterday afternoon, it was impossi~
ble for them to be present at the first
meeting of the tryouters, and a sec—

Sketch by Kemmerer Brings
View of East Side
in Manhattan

By ALFRED CONARD

Two pictures from the new Sep-
tember Tanager will not easily leave
the mind's eye. One is a carefree
prince of laziness described by Nor-
man Hall. The other is a sunset Scene
on East river, at Brooklyn bridge,
by J‘ohn Kcmmerer.

Norman Hall writes of a literary
friend, Knight, who like Hall himself
has retired to Tahiti. The author
tells how he and four charwomen
spent two days shoveling the rub-
bish, cohwcbs, and even wasp posts
from Knight's residence, only to realr
ize that they had robbed the place
of its personality. Hall’s conscience
was soothed only when he discovered
that his friend was unaware of the
difference,

sunset glance at the east side of
Manhattsn.

“Mr. Beck,” by Harold Croghan, is
less successful. It is an attempt to
picture slum people. The incident
used is trite, and there is little appeal
to the senses.

Hugh Curtis in"Clever” has also
fallen short in portraying an indi-
vidual, but has clearly marked a
type. Curtis has some excellent
touches of Mexican revolution atmos-
phere.

Bank clerk Character study

“M'r. Midgely Takes off His Rub-
hers,” by Mildred Mel'ryman, is an
interesting character study of ii. bank
clerk who is touched with wander-
lust and aspirations toward self-
determination.

Prof. Cecil F. Lavell and Prof. H.
W. Norris have contributed to the
philosophical questionings of this
issue. Profesor Lavcll proposes the
paradox of the essential equality and
the eternal inequality of inch.

The reader who has heard Pro
fessor Lavell lecture will hear the
familiar tones and see again the
