The search of a dorm room last

illegal items, however, were conﬁse

Thomas said thatitis "unlikely"
thatthe studentsinvolvedin the search
will be charged for the other items
found in the dorm room.

“In this district, if a place is

else of a lesser Crime is found. they
won’t usually prosecute on it,” he
said “Our main consent is the arson
situation and what appears to be a

serious mattert"

The students may, however, be
brought before JUDCO, the student
council which has regulation over
violationsofresiderltialhallrulesand
other student rights. Or they could go
before the College Hearing Board.
Thomas said.

So far. no students have yet been
charged by the college or police in

any incident.

A charge of arson, which Lamb
called “Very serious," would carry a
mandatory sentence of 25 years to
life.

“Any time there is a fire in a
building where people are involved.
it's taken very seriously." Lamosaid.

But if the students now under

doesn’t know ifthey will receive the
mandatory arson charge.

Feminist to discuss stereotypes, political correctness today

By RIVA SHARPLES

News Editor

ONTRARY to popular be
lief, feminists are not anti-
monorantiefantily,said phlr

losopher Marilyn Friedman during a
plioneinterview Tuesday. Friedman,
an Assocmte Professor of Philosoe
pity at Washington University in St.
Louis. Missouri, will deliver a talk
about feminism and political correcte
ncss today from 2:00 to 3:00 pm. in
the South Lounge of the Forum,
“The basic point of my paper
[“Ot'Mothers and Families, Men and
Sex: The Plain Truth About Femie
nlsm"] is todelliolishtheunflattering
stereotypes that surround feminists,"

she said

Friedman will attack four major
stereotypes of feminists in her talk,
she said.

“Thefirststereotypeisthatfemi-
nists arc contemptous of traditional
hotnen-iakers and women who stay at
home to be mothers," she said. ”This
is not true, Feminists have a deep
appreciation of the role of Ironic-
makcr and mother."

Feminists do not oppose “the
family" as the feminist stereotype
suggests, Friedman said,

“Feminists criticize the male
dominated families, but they aren't
anti~family, Feminists alone are one
of the biggest supporters of non—trite
ditional families, like gay/lesbian

couples or single parent families."

Feminists are not manehaters,
They aim their attacks at legitimate
male targets who abuse women or at
maleedominancc. Feminists aim their
attacks at social practices. not indie
viduals."

The fourth feminist stereotype
that Friedman hopes to address today
is that feminists hate sex,

“Feminists don’t hate sex, they
only hate sex that is malardominaled
orthatdeferstothemale desires,"she
said.

The strides that have been made
during the past two decades iii the
feminist movementarc in danger due
to exaggerated stereotypes espoused
by conservative spokespersons like

Rush Limbaugh, Friedman said.

“Iwillbetalkingalittle bitabout
things that feminists have done in the
past and about the very important
social activities they are worked on."
she said,

Friedman, who said she be
