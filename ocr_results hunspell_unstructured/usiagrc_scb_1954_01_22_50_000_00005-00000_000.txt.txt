Cagers Lose 8lh,
9th Games in How
Away From Home

by Jim O’Hanlon
Twin defeats at St. Olaf and
,Cornell, both in convincing fash-
ion, knocked the props from
under Grinnell‘s conference
championship drive this

tended Grinnell's losing streak
on the road‘ to nine straight
games.
Rams Start Fast
On Monday the Pioneers
bowed to Cornell 77-55 in the
Ram’s new gym. The alert, fast-

duarter 25.15, than doubled the
lmargin in the next stanza to
go ahead at the half 48-28. The
Pioneers were close only at 7-r
midway m the opening period.
Watson Hartbeck, who spark-
led on defense, and Dick Brur
baker, scoring 12 and 10 points
respectively led the first half
drive for the Rams; while John
Musser‘s dozen points enabled
Grinnell to stay within reach.
At the end of the third period
the ,lromestanding Rams led
63-39
~ Grinnell Subs Help

On the good side of the led
ger for the Scarlet and Black
was the good showing made by

action in the second half, which
may be of help to Coach Pfitsch
in future games.

Brubaker was leading scorer
for Cornell as he netted 17
points, while George Hahn add-

Wlth 16 and Don Hager with 14

Olaf gained revenge for the
7s»68 defeat hung on it last
month at Grinnell as the oles
handed the Pioneers their first
league loss, 84-65.

The hot st. Olaf team grabbed
a 30-16 lead in the first quarter
which the Pioneers could never
rvercume. The rest of the way
the game was evenly played, one
half time score being 50-36.

ference attractions. In addition

The Lawrence crew, although
sitting on top of the conference
along with Cornell now with
three wins in four games, has
had the schedule in its favor
so far, beating cellar—dwelling
Knox twice, and lowly Ripon
once. Lawrence's victory over
Knox last weekend was by
only five points. The Vikings’
.only loss came at the hands of
IMonmouui, 89r78.

Vikings Lose Grosse

Lawrence has been substan.
tially weakened by the loss of
its leading scorer, Ed Grosse,
because of a hernia operation,
Grosse was averaging over 16
points a game. Chief threat to
the Pioneers will be forward
Dick Gast.

In the second clash with Coe,
the Pioneers have the distinct
disadvantage of playing on the
Kohawks’ home court. The
first meeting saw Grinnell
shade Coe in double-overtime
at Darby,_95.93, last Dec. 17.

Fitch Leads League

Coe boasts the conference
scoring leader in Bill Fitch,
who pumped in 25 counters
from his guard slot in the first
game here. Jack Fulton, lofty
6-8 center, has canned over 50%

averaging 18.8 points a game.
The squad also includes able
performers like John Manon, a
6-4 guard, and Gay Dahn, both
of whom caused much trouble

'Two‘ Records Fall

the pool record he established
last year in the individual med-
levy

In an effort to regain first place, Grinnell’s fourth—place cagers

to Lhe Lawrence tilt here tomor-

ruw night and the C02 game at Cedar Rapids next Friday, the

if the Pioneers are to stay in
the race, the next two games
are “mus ", says Coach John
Pfitsch. His big problem is re-
building team morale after two
bitter road defeats. "But the
boys have no intention of giv-
ing up," be emphasized.

Growl Back in Lineup

One bright spot in the team
picture, however, is the addi-
tion of guard Bud Growl to the
lineup. Coach Pﬁtsch plans to
use him sparingly tomorrow
night, Crawl had tallied 43
points in three conference
game before being iniured.

Pfitsch promised to shuﬂﬂe
his lineup about considerably
during tomorrow’s game in an
attempt to find a combination
which will function more
smoothly than those used in
earlier games.

The non—conference Iowa
Teachers game following the
week of final exams, appears
to be a tight game. The Tutors,
who lost their _ﬁrst~ seven
games of the season, have re-
bounded and are now in sec-
ond spot in the Norﬂi Central
league with a 3-2 record.

Tutors Lack Height

Although no man on the
squad is over 6-2, Iowa Teach-
ers will present a wellrbal-
anced attack.

,.(;oacl-l EGV Eooth’s freshman
basketball team will pléy'host
to the Iowa State Teachers
college freshman five on Feb.

neers will be trying to better
their 50-50 record, having lost
to Coe and won from Cornell.

This is the third year of the
Grinnell-Teachers rivalry, 1n
the first year, 1952, Grinneli
trounced the Panthers, but last
year the Grinnell frosh lost by
one point.

The Teachers squad is re
ported to be very strong this
year. At the post the tutors
have Ray Nisson, all—state high
school cager in lowa last year.

Coach Booth gave his prob-
able starting line-up as Tom
Doyle and Larry Koch at
guards, Dick Crowl and Run,
Veverka at the forwards, and=
Jerry Moyer in the post.

Cornell, Lawrence
Share Firs’r Place

Cornell and Lawrence moved
into a tie for the leadership in
the Midwest conference basket-
ball standings, while previously
undefeated Grmnell skidded
from the top spot to fourth
place.

Although the Rams have won
three out of four against some
of the strongest teams in the
league, .all four of the games
were played on their home
court. of their eight remaining
games. six are on the road.
Cornell meets Knox and Mon.
mouth on successive nights this
weekend on the lllinois teams
home floors. Coe‘s fifth-place
pagers also journey into illi—
nois to play the some two teams
in reversed order.

A look at the record reveals
that the Lawrence five is in
first place with victories over
the two bottom teams—Knox
and Ripon, The Vikings will be
the underdogs tomorrow when
they meet the Pioneers on the
lGrlnnell hardwood.
