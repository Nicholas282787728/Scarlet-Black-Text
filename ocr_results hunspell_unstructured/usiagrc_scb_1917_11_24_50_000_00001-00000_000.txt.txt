for the excellent opportunity it at—

“It is full of melodramatic sensa-

busy Jew drummers and well-dressed
gambling blackguards, thieves, and
homemade bread, sample cases ,Bibles,

Fibressor Charles hoble believes in
a rather conservative adaptation or
s uplilied spelling, and that the words
which the college uses in its official
publications are about. the only ones
ilie students should use. However, he
does not think simpliﬁed spelling
should be used in applications tor

more universally and crucially adopt-
ted. He says as far as he is cons
corned he has learned to spell once
and does not care to learn again, but
that students don't know how to spell
anyway, so they probably would not
mind.

Sensible Siiupliii ion

Professor L. D. Hartsou believes in
the sensible simpliﬁcation of spelling.
Tho spelling ot a language is always
slowly and unconsciously changing, he
says He believes in deliberately sim—
plifying the spelling oi some or the
words.

Miss Luella Reed, or the German
department, believes that we should
keep up with the recognized changes
in spelling, but that we should not

Simplified spelling is a question of
much interest in educational groups
at plesent. Professor Mcader of
Michigan university presents the folc
low g statistic .

"Three hundred and eighty univsiu
sities, colleges and normal schools
either use simplified spelling in their
official publications and correspond—
ence or permit students to use them
in their written work. One hundred
and seventy of these institutions, in.
eluding seventeen state universities,
have formally approved the movement,
in most cases by faculty resolution,
Four hundred and ﬁTEYV 'x newspa-

CHINESE STUDENT
LEAD 1'. M. MEETING

“Chinese peasants have one partic-
ular virtue, that which makes for the
respect of their parents," was an im»
portant point made by r. Tsai in his
speech on “Chinese Peasants" at the
Y. in, c. A. meeting led by hincse
students Thursday evening. Tsai spoke
on the living conditions, education and
character of this class, which makes
up a large part or the population or
China.

The second speaker ol the evening
was K c Lee, who chose “’l‘llo Mis-
sionary Movement in Cliillat’ as his
topic. Lee, alter tiaeing brielly the
history of the movement. pointed out
what remarkable strides the move
inent had made. The speaker ended
his talk with a tribute to the work
and men engaged in turtliering the
movement, "Missionary men are teach-
ing the young. healing the sick and
preaching the word or God.”

The meeting was in charge or Mr. Lin.
