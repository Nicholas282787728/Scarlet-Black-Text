SATURDAY, APRIL 7. 1934.

WELCOIVLE, DELEGATES
Grillllqll extends a hearty wélcomc to the dclcr
gates to the Mississippi Valley conference of Inter-
national Relations clubs and the Iowa Student con-
vention on International Relations.
The mere fact that more than 300 delegates

from 47 colleges and universities ill eight states will
travel hundreds of miles, in some cases, to attend a
conference on international relations, is a sign ol’
changing fil‘neSiille birth of El new era. No longer
may llliddle-wcstcrllcrs he called provincial. Stu-
dents taking part ill round table discussion this
weekend have shown themselves to be as well
versed ill world affairs as it is possible to become
by study alld contact with authorltlcs.

Who can say that such a conference is but a
hashing of theoretical ideas? If the youth of tho
world grows to understand the peoples of the
world, is it not likely that the possibilities of war,
caused by hate and fear and misulldcrstallding,
will be greatly diminished? Whatever may. be said
of the American educational system, it cannot be
accused of soft-pedaling the importance of under-
standing tlle world’s problems,

TIME TO ACT »

‘Vith the opening of the 1934 football season
still six months away, the bugaboo of the serious
Grillnoll grid situation llfls bobbed up to haunt The
campus with the ironic announcement that ”14 ”IO“
respond to Coach Wall’s call for spring practice.”
Tllc turnout assumed the proportions of all April
Fool joke rather than a football Squad

The announcement ill the Des Moincs papers oi'
the disappointing response was doubly humiliating
since it followed closely upon the abundant pubr
l y a lllpallyillp: Drake’s spring training period
which . concluded with two regulation grid
cllcounle against Central alld St. Benedict’s
collages, ill w oh the Bulldogs employed two colli-
plctc squads.

So for tho collcgc officials llavr rci'uscd to look
upon the local grid. situation as inflncllcillg the
welfare ol' the loo]. but it cannot be denied that
1lle l-ocont pullllclt couldn’t be other than flctr‘
mental. Whetllcr the, school officia. \ sh to rc
oguize the fact or not, tho alhl 1 'oucss of fl
school i one of tho primal-v considerations of many
prospective freshmen and llmllv will hesitate to
cnroll at a collcgc whom a lo ‘llg Football lcfuu is
practically assured. If: Grilnlell i not to he handi-
capped ill this manner, active steps should be takr‘ll
to improve the local football situation.

While the small turnout for spring practice is
to it limited extent due to lack of illtftl it . lo a
greater extent due to absence of material. With
the majority of colleges encouraging the cllroll»
mom, of prep grid stars at their institution by offers

of scholarships alld jobs. the ollly way to achieve
all :lppr ciuhlo illcrcilsc ill the number of football
prospects to Gl‘illlloll is to employ sillliltlr methods.

The school officials may claim that this would
be plosclytillg; but if it must be called “buying”
to give} -cfcrcllcc to athletes over studcll f cqual
scholastic ability ill the matter of scholarships and
work on the campus, the time to buy has certainly
come.

It is common knowledge on the campus that
Grillncll has lost a number of prospective athletic
stars during the last few years because of the
apparent Incl: of interest upon the part, of the
Grillncll representatives who interviewed them.
The field ruprcsclltativcs cannot be blamed, for with
so few athletic scholarships at their disposal it is
mild to expect them to attrnct many athletic stars
to l'll‘inlloll.

Either a nulllllcr of specifically athletic
scholarships, such as have been awarded ill past
)l‘illu should llo pl-olldcll for; or. if the cllool’s
finnnrinl condition eliminates this possibility, a
reservation should be llladc to flcvotc «l lrlrgllr per
wilt of tho scholarships now llvailnhlc to attracting
prospective athletes

NAZI DEFIED.

Education. st-iolll-o and even the arts have come
ululor varying degrees of subjection to tho IIitlcr
rulc ill Germany, bill the pulpit has rclllaiuctl
adamant ill its fight for recognition of alld respect
for church rights.

It is quite amazing that of all the institutions
which the Nazi regime has endeavored to control,
the church alone has been successful in its re.
allcc. Whereas the Pope’s powers have been lllalli-
" tly rcstl Itcd ill Facisti Italy, tho seat of the
Roman Catholic religion, and the church was com-
pletely destroyed ill Soviet Russo, both the catholic
and protestant clergy havc defied Nazi orders in
Germany, and so far have been successful ill tllcir
passive resistance to govcrlllllcntal domination.

Freedom of speech and religions thought has
liPcll the point of contention bctwccll the churches
and tho Hitlerito adlllillistrfltiou. Not only have
the priests and ministers been denied the right to
criticize the existing order from the pulpit and ill
church publications, but an attempt has been made
to place religions instruction directly lllldcr the
control of the governlllcnt so that propaganda
might be dissclllinatcd through the medium of
appointed church leaders.

A twofold conclusion may be drawll from tllc
refusal of German churches to subordinate them-
selves to the will of the Nazi rule. Hitler’s
impotence against the defiance of the pulpit reveals
a weakness ill the Nazi administration which has
hitherto been concealed. Moreover, the successful
resistance of the German clergy is striking evidence
that the power of the church, of which many have
srown‘ skeptical ill recent yea) is still a great
force ill the world’s political as u ell as social devel-
opulent.

Other Opinions

WHO IS A TRUE LEADER?
(Daily Trojan)

The public is the basic foundation of democratic
government. No matter how well trained our leaders.
democratic government cannot rise higher than its
courseithe public. The cause and the cure of bad goVr
ernment are to be found in us, the people. In our ideas
and in our conflict lies the cause of our political and eco—
nomic troubles. Therefore, are we not wasting our time
harassing public officials of the past administration?
Instead of spending our time trying to put the blame on
the so-called political grafters. public officials of the
past administration, and other persons who were in
places of responsibility at the time of the economic col-
lapse, would we not obtain better results if we would
analyze and try to correct the mistakes and shortcom—
ings of the body politic?

Truo leaders of the people do not seek power or po-
sition for themselves, nor do they advocate pulling down
those in the upper classcs Instead, they undertake the
unpopular task of pointing out the mistakes of the
common people and teaching them to correct: their ways.
thus helping them to improve their own condition. When
history is finally written, who will be deemed the true
leader in the present drama of world affail‘siHltler or
Mahatma Ghsndi?

A real leader must criticize us, must find fault with
us, and must attempt to teach us. He is not a leader
who tells us that we are a wonderfully perfect people,
that our troubles are due to a few rich people being
crooked, and that our political troubles are caused by our
leaders being dishonest. Such a person is not an honest
leader, but a seeker of power and position He wants to
ride to power and position upon our prejudices and our
misunderstandings.

Pianist Praised for Talent

I Revealed During Recital;
J Finales Criticized

(By H. w. MATLACK)

in spite of several counter attrac-
tions a large audience came out last
Thursday evening to hear Edward
Shadbolt give his piano recital in
Herrick chapel. Sbadbolt offered a
program of unusual strength. which
throughout its duration or ncarly
two hours never gave the performer
any opportunity for relaxation, but
which held the interest of the audi-
ence in increasing- degree as the over
uing went on.

Mr. Shadholt has the attributes of
a piano virtuoso; that is to say be,
has the intimate vivid sensitiveness
to music which makes the difference
between an artist and a good inusir
cian. Each phrase he plays makes
a definite picture in his imagination.
and takes its place in the sequence of
phrases which are built into‘ a piece
of music. This is not an acquired
talent, it is native genius, and when
it has been subject for years not on-
Iy to masterly leadership but most
of all to self-discipline the result is,
as in Shadbolt’s case, an artist who
has something of his own to say.

To be perfectly fair there are one
or two tendencies which this young
artist should be careful not to follow.
One is the sentimentalizing of final
chords through too prolonged use of
the sustaining pedal. Another is the
cult of the dark auditorium, wliicb in
his recital put a soft pedal on the
whole concert. Any performer owes
it to his listeners to let them see his
face, and to read their programs.
