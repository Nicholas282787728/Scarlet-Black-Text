Nollen House
disconnected

“It’s lonely at the top" is how the old cliche goes and the
second floor of Nollen_House is getting lonelier as the weeks

go by.

President Turner laid down a policy last year which
restricted fertilizing to the playing fields and new plantings
on campus. This year, however, a new policy has been
planted over Turner's as everything (including the sidewalks
apparently) has been fertilized. Now the funny part of the
situation is that even Turner and Dean Walker were sur-
prised by the new fertilizer policy.

Actually, it's not funny that they were surprised. It’s
disturbing and somewhat frightening. Now, as students, we
are often forced to take it as a given that the administration
will surprise us. But when they start surprising themselves
as well as us, the situation is bad.

Last week’s surprise was on Turner. He hadn't seen the
new grading proposal formulated by Dean Eysenbach.
Before spring break, it became clear that a student had been
shown the Saga contract by an administrator against orders

from the dean’s office.

Isolation must have closed in on second floor Nollen

House.

Considering the events, who's trustworthy? Does anyone
communicatewith each other in Nollen House and among its

subsidiary branches?

It's an awful feeling of creeping paranoia and doom to be
told one thing and another happens, but it’s even worse to
never be told. Maybe Turner and Walker now know how we

often fee].

If the way the administration communicates among itself
is at all similiar to the way it communicates to the faculty,
it’s no wonder there are so many bad vibrations beginning to
stir as the’two bodies prepare to discuss tenure.

An obvious need for communication exists. Turner and
Walker must be getting lonely up there. Even if they aren’t,
we sure are getting nervous down here knowing the lines of
communication are so disconnected.

KD/C execs support Blair

Editor's Note: rhe headline “KDIC
Blasts stair" last week was innacurate
and should have read “Kutc “1:30
News Staff Blasts stair." The s a a
apotogizes.

To the Editor:

In the April 2nd Scarlet and
Black. a letter appeared charging
KDIC News Director Shelly Blair
with gross mismanagement oi the
KDIC news department. We feel
that this attack against Shelly is
unwarranted and that the charges
are so vague as to only provide a
personal attack

First. it should be noted that
although the charges \icre launr
ched by only a small dissenting
fat: 'on of the Kch staff, con
sisting of less than one-tenth of the
entire staff and less than anesthird
of the news department, the s K ii
labeled the letter “KDIC Blasts
Blair," This headline distorted the
tacts and tended to imply that the
majority of the KDIC staff ap
proved of this letter.

a total of $20 a week from the
union's strike fund Think for just a
moment about supporting a
family, buying groceries, paying
bills, etc, on 20 bucks a week. The
steaks signed out weren’t for
backyard barbecues; they were
given to assist the workers through
hard times. Although it was damn
little, it allowed some students to
demonstrate their support for the
workers.

While some students took an
active part in the workers’ strike,
the majority of us passively ac-
copied the administration‘s story
Some of us even became strike
breakers by doing essential jobs to
keep the school in operation,
prolonging the strike and the bat:
Workers' financial plight, Rather
than insulting those supportive
students, we should commend
them for their perspective into

Second, the implication was
made that KDIC news funds were
misused. All KDIC expenditures
are made with the approval of the
Station Manager and must comply
with the KDIC budget, which is
approved by the Student
Publications and Radio Com-
mittee We know oi no niisape
propriations this year in the news
department.

The letter also implied that
Shelly had been retained by the
Radio and Publications Committee
as £1 matter of form. In recent
history the committee has
removed salaried personnel who
were not adequately filling their
posts, The decision to retain Shelly
was responsibly made alter two
(‘losed sessions with Ms, Blair and

significant in itself as it is of the

indicative of a general student

not directly threaten our
wellbeing. These “striking

Q

KD/C News Staffers defend Blair

To the Editor:

As a member of the still-existent
KDIC News Staff, we feel obligated
to respond to the grossly inace
curate and misleading letter
headlined “KDlC BLASTS
BLAIR” which appeared in the
April 2nd issue of The Scarlet and
Black. To begin with, the headline
itself was an absolute
misrepresentation of the situation
as was the letter which followed.
The letter, written by the 10:30
News Staff, representing about
one-third of the entire staff. listed a
number ot allegations of which
they thought KDIC News Director
Shelly Blair to be guilty, These
allegations were not supported
with evidence. They also
represented certain unrealistic
expectalions or Ms, Blair or any
other news director, For a group of
people who claimed in their letter
to be so “dedicated to thc prin-
ciples of responsible and reliable
journalism" they displayed an
cxample of some ol the most
irresponsible and unreliable
journalistic style that we have seen
recently

There were several slateniunls
In the letter which we would like to
(Address directly. First, Ms Blair
was rarely confronted with
criticismshythel News taff.
St: ul limes th took their
criticisms to the [executive Board
or the Strident Publications and
licdio Committee without giving
prior notice to Ms Blair. One issue
in particular. involving iicws
tormot, was handled in this icry

Way, The 10:30 News Staff did not
feel that “Earth News," a weekly
news report. should be included in
the KDIC News because they
considered it too biased in contrast
to the Associated Press reports.
M5. Blair. on the other hand, felt
these reports added interest and
balance to the AP reports

Attcr a compromise reached
earlier this year in which they
agreed to iise only a certain
amount of ”Earth News” with
each report (less than what Ms.
Blair desired and more than what
the 10:30 staff desired), the staff
went to the Student Publications
and Radio Committee to have
“Earth News" removed from the
tormat altogether. This was done
Without his Blair's knowledge,
when they received no satisfaction
trom the committee they began to
use other covert tactics to get their
way. Not only did they hang a sign
in the newsroom which said that
on one was to use “Earth News"
unless dcspcratc, they even went
so far as to hide the “Earth News"
itscll right belore they resigned

This was not only a direct attack
on Ms. Blair‘s authority (which
was done excessively throughout
the year) but it also served to
coniuse the news staff. Perhaps
this was olic source of the disunity
about which they spoke iii their
letter?

Thc ‘closcd' meeting about
which they seemed so distraught
was another tase in which the 10:30
staff went hchind Ms. Blair's back
uilh their complaints. They did not

even have the courtesy to inform
her of their plans to attempt to
remove her trom her position as
news director. After they had a
meeting Wi|h the Committee tMs,
Blair was not present) at which
they presented their allegations,
Ms, Blair thought it only fair th
she too should be allowed to me
with the committee without her
accusers present. The committee
agreed and. after meeting with It.
Blair, the committee called bot
sides together for a final session.
The ‘Closed' session of which they
spoke was nothing more than a
chance for Ms. Blair to answer lh
charges made against her withou
interruption.

Finally, we feel that any lack of
regimentatlon or policing which
the 10'30 News staff seems to
desire may be attributable to the
fact that Ms, Blair believes, and
rightly so its tar as we are con
cerned. that the Kch news Shoul

fact that lnost people who attend a
