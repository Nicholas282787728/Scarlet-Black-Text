Barbie Doll quickly matures into top band

by Mike Ellis

It was clear it was near the
end of the Barbie Doll practice.
Chris Sutcliff, the tall, bushy-
headed bassist with the public
radio-voice was just finishing his
fifth beer from a Budweiser six-
pack.

“See if you can recognize
this." belted Ben Lezin across the
room as he adjusted his guitar
strap. I settled myself into a seat
behind the drummer, Chris
McColluml I really had no idea
what to expect or what to ask
them. I had seen them play four
times previously. beginning last
fall when they played a short set
of mostly R.E.M. and Husker Du
covers. In the two concerts
siliee, they had broadened their
musical output to include some
rock-and»roll classics as well as
some other progressive tunes.

“He wants you to listen to
this." said McCollum before
turning back towards the band.

started into a slow, lazy reggae
number, surprising considering
their past performances. I
listened for the words. Led

drawn-out, almost country
rendition of the chorus, the words
unexpectedly sounded as If they

swayed to the sounds on his own
solo. It seemed to some at the

‘ beginning of the year he wouldn‘t

be playing at all. After a very
successful but contentious year
with Eoink, Lezin was not
interested in playing in a band.
“tic hadn’t played all summer,"
drawled McCollum, and added in
his Texas accent that he “wasn't
in the best of spirits" at the

beginning of the year.
McCollum had considered
asking Lezin to start a band but
decided Lezin was a “scary~
looking guy.” He didn't have to
ask. According to McCollum,
Lezin “showed up completely out
of the blue" on his doorstep after
hearing he played drums
MeCollum had played in high
school bands but had no exposure

to the Grinnell band scene. Lezin
asked Sutcliff to join and the trio
assembled in Norris’ basement to
see if the chemistry was there.
“Of course Chris scared me,"
remembers McCollum as he
thought oi the big bassist
wearlng his sunglasses and toting
his usual six k of Budweiser.
But the thought of playing eased
his fears. R.E.M. and Husker Du

were new to Sutcliff whose
background consisted of blues and
reggae after playing with Red
Stripe last year. But he quickly
caught on to the accelerated sound
and everything seemed set to add
a singer.

The trio practiced for three
weeks before the Sunday arrived
when they would finally ﬁnd if
Lorkovic was qualiﬁable. A few
crooners who auditioned for the
job were so bad the band
wondered if there were any suit»
able singers available. Finally,
Lorkovic showed up with the
lyrics memorized. Lezin recruited
the singer based on a single
performance last year with Boink.
The group's lead singer forgot the
lyrics during a concert and asked
for assistance from the audience.
Lorkovic climbed onto the stage
and crooked his way through a
drunken version of AC/DC'S
“Hell‘s Bells." The performance
remained imprinted in Lezin‘s
mind. A few verses into
Lorkovic’s first rendition with
Barbie Doll singing Husker Du's
“Sorry Somehow." the band
knew the wait had been worth it.
MeCollum remembers how the
mood of the band suddenly
changed: “I was grinning so
much my cheeks hurt." Later.
Lorkovic asked Stanton to join
on vocals.

The band has expanded its
repertoire to include, as Sutcliff

Great Wall suicides reveal underlying tensions

by May-lee Chai

We went to the Great Wall
near the end of November. The
day slam-d off cloudy and we were
disappointed when we left, all 207
some Americans and our two
Chinese chaperons piled together
on a drafty bust By the time we
arrived, however, the sky was

blue. From the bus windows, we
could see the wall rising from the
mountain like the spine of some
enormous dinosaur.

Although the clouds had
lifted, there was a hazy quality to
the light, as if all the wall were
veiled. The brown dead grass, the

barren trees, the dusty firs, the
dirty rocks on the mountain, all
seemed to waver as the sun
reﬂected off the dust in the air.
Climbing on the wall we felt as

' though we were suspended in the

middle of a giant web covering
the beige bandages of a dusty
mummy whose spine had broken
through the wrappings.

Some of us had chosen to go
on the left path at the Badaling
section of the Great Wall. It is
harder, steeper—almost vertical
in some parts—and lcssru‘avelled.

 

I thought it would be more
interesting. We walked to the
end of the restored part of the
wall and climbed into a little
watchtower.

Before us, the wall lay in
ruins. Behind us, it was a sleek,
shining, glowing path, dragon-
like. Far off we could see the
tourists on the wall like ants
swarming over a bone. We tried
to imagine what it had been like,
thousands or years ago, for sol—
diers scanning the empty hills for
signs of Mongol horsemen. The
