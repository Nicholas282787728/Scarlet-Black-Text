WORTH PRESERVING

There was a great spirit evident ill the men’s
student body yesterday. To persons outside of the
group, it may be hard to explain, but it is true
nevertheless.

The class spirit which was evidenced ill skirm—
ishes in the afternoon, and in the dining room and
on the atlllctic field ill the evening, has bound
dozens of men together ill closer friendship and
has made no enemies. Yet. ill spite of its good of-
fcct, this santc spirit led to the injuring of two men
and to all impression, among certain persons, pcl-
haps, that the scrap was cruel and barbaric.

Those who saw the scrap realize that both in-
juries—which have proved to be slightiworc acc
dental, and might just as well have been incurred
ill a spccdball or basketball game. There was no
“cruelty” of any sort evident on the field, lnen
on both sides of the combat retaining their spirit
of fair competition,

The student body is extremely sorry that these
injuries did occur. However, they do not provc
that the class scrap is all outworn remnant of bar-
barityiluorcly that such a scrap must he more
closely supervised to see that men do not become
exhausted so that their resistance is weakened.
Th0 unity and spirit of cooperation which grows
out of such an affair must not be over—balanced by
possible harmful effects.

A PRECEDENT

.For more than 150 years the citizcns of this
country looked upon its constitution as a perma-
nent and unalterablc body of statutes. It was com-
monly conceived that once a statute became a part
of this document it would remain the law of the
land as long as the constitution itself retained its
validity. The possibility of striking out any por-
tion of the document and declaring it illegal never
entered the public mind—until a few years after
the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendmcnt. But
now, within a very few days, thisanlcndment will
be relegated to the legislative scrap heap. Such an
action gives rise to serious doubt conccrning the
original expediency of adding this amendment to
the constitution.

All exceedingly bittcr controversy preceded
the drawing up and ratification of the prohibition

amendment was contested by its opponents, the Ice
gality of its addition to the constitution being ques-
tioncd on threc diffclent counts Some of the
not” states contended that it “as an unreason-
ahlc interference with the rights of statrs as gnalu
antccd by the constitution. The Attorncy General
of Rhodc Island, opposing its status as an amend-
ment, claimed that only a statute drawn up to cor-
rect an error in tho oriUinal instrument could be so
classified. Finally, objections were made as to the
legality of its ratification, since the amendment
' not submitted to let'clcndnm ill any of the
lcrahlo numlict 01 states “hole refcrendum is
ploildcd for a rclicw of legislative action. How-
cvcl those 0h ctions welc all overridden or ig-
ncrcd hy the dry forces, alld the question of the
amendment ’5 constitutionality \V‘lS ncvcr settled.
Whether tllc anlcndmcnt legal or not is no
longer the question. it has been apparent for some
time that it was a mistake to place the prohibition
measure in the constitution. What the consequences
of this error ill legislative judgment will be, cannot
he definitely predicted. Many, hon/over, liclicvc
that the precedent cstnhlishad by the repeal of the
Eighteenth Amendment will serve to replace the
former aued respect of the people toward the con-
stitution with the realization that, like any human
document, it is not infallible. and that it may be
altered to meet (- “sting conditions with no di
spcct to its framers.

WHAT Is PROGRESS?

In order to define pro, ass. wo should first
ask ourselves: ”\l'llat is the purpose of life Y" The
answer would most likely be: “The purpose of life,
is to achieve happin and well-being”.

Therefore, progr would llc couce rod with;
the happiness and well-being of manklnd. “'9“.
how far have we progressed in the last 2000 years?

Indeed, we have the outomohile, the telephone.
and the toothbrush, \Vc have steam hcal, canned;
goods, and elect 'c lights, Have those things made1
us any ltappicl , \rc wc happier than our parents,

in growing proportionately ill our social sciences.
At this moment, with all the wealth and power and
technique of man’s ingenuity, the world is pro
paring for a conflict whcll, if not quickly prevents

llidr‘mis mockery of man's “progres”.

We are not foolish enough to believe that
science and invention should stop, Rather. we (le-

progress.

Other Opinions

mtonsssous on ROBOTS 7
(Daily Trojan)

Securing academic freedom for professors has been
outlined as one of the objectives of the s. (2. Chapter
of the American Association of University Professors.
This idea has long been dangled temptingly before the
eyes of the pedagogs of this country.

Too often the policies of a university and its board
of trustees control the utterancesof the instructors in
the classrooms. In fact, each professor is made aware
of the policy of the university and is expected to pass
it on to his students in delectable form. Personal beliefs
of each man hold no place in his academic life and each
year lectures become more stereotyped in persuance of
university policy.

One of the eminent professors on this campus one
nounces to each class at the beginning of the semester
that he is not guided in‘ his opinions by any governing
body, and that his ideas are the result of long study
and careful research in his field. This professor cannot
be commended too highly for his intelligent outlook.
If this fact were true of more members of the faculty
the student response to learning would be less stereoA
typed and more indicative of personal strivings to gain
knowledge. students are without the incentive to learn
when their instructors are merely repeating words paSSr
ed on to them by a directing board.
