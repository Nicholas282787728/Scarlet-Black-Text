The spin s of a couple hundred Grim
nclliaus were rescued from the gloomy
ellects of the wet weather of last Fri-
day evening by the dance in tile hand
gymnasium.

At first glance one would think the
chair had taken the form of a millta -~
ball, but the occasion proved informal
in every respect.

Flags were in abundance through
out the entire building. In the center
there was an immense banner extend
ing almost to the door. On each side
of this wcrc hung the smaller ones,
and red, white and blue streamers ex-
tended over the entire ceiling.

The pi-orgam cari-icd oul the patri-
otic idca, being made up with the un-
tioual colors. Besides indicating the
type ot dance, the name of the selecr
tinn to be played on each particular
number was announced on the pro-
grain.

A large number of aliiiiiui | turned
for the commencement fostiv ice on
Friday in‘ order to enjoy the “hop,"
which will hereafter be a feature of
commencement week.

Trent's orchestra, of Des Moines,
furnished a wellrbalanced and varied
program. They were exceptionally
liberal with their encorcs, although
they were unable to render their en»
tire program on account of the late»
ness of the hour.

upon the qualities of structure, style
and deliverv.

Speaks on I ,

The winning speech was on the sub—
ject, “War and Industry: It argued
that while American industry must be
speeded up to meet present conditions,
this should not be done at the expense
of sacriﬁcing all piogressivc legisla»
tive reforms in the ﬁeld of labor. The
example of England at the beginning
of the war proves that such a thing
would spell disaster This speech was
delivered in a very forceful and coil-
vlncing manner, and met a heartv re-
sponse from the audience. Fridlund
won second place in the Hill contest
last year.

)Icoli Discusses Prohibition.

oek chose tor his subject “Wor and
Prohibition." He pointed out that the
outcome of the war depended greatly
upon the conservation of the food
supply in the United States. His ease
and strength ’of delivery gave second
in the opinion of the judges. "Recent
Changes in Our National Life" was
presented by Van Dbl-ii in a forceful
style which held the audience. His
delivery showed that he had his sub-
ject matter well in hand. .

The ﬁve other men handled their
subjects in an etfective manner, Hal-
tenhach‘s “Military Training in Our
Schools” was delivered in an appeals
ing style. Rafle. in a matter-obfact
speech, “Conscription and Democracy,"
and Ladd With "SehdIng Troops to
France,” were well received. “Mili-
iaiy Training in Gl‘innell" furnished
