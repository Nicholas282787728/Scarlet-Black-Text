ET’S get right to the point.
L Tonight‘s dinner is our ﬁve

star meal ofthe week. Sicil»
ian sandwiches with spicy saucer Re-
minds us of the old country. Stay
away from wok bar tonight. This
meal gets wwx.

Saturday. the roast bccfand ched-
dar on an onion roll leaves a little to
be desired, but the onion rings are a
hit. For some-
thing different.
there’s turkeyand
dressing casse-
role, which has
been good in the
past; 2“ 1er Din-
ner: again. “don't
eatafajita.” Make
a ques-adilla, or
eat cheese mani-
cotti. Jason says.
“We use three
kindsofcheeses!"

Major dis-
agreement breaks
outamongthewritersaboutSunday’s
meals. Jon and led both love the
chickenbroccoliandcheeseencmute
for lunch and the cheese and mush-
room triangles for dinner, while Ja-
son and Matt are the dissenters. For
the whole day we rate ¥¥¥,

Monday lunch is just plain ol‘
pizza and turkey meatloaf. If you are
on a limited meal plan. this is one to
avoid. Dinner isanotherstory. Once
again, we have spicy tofu! Also,
there are the chicken tenders. We
rememberthedaysofyesteryearwhen
these were a Sunday staple. (we!)

Tuesday lunch is the vegetarian
meal of the week. Sprouting pita has

Tuesday dinner is absolutely dis-
gusting, although Jed likes the can

Services Director Dave McConnell at
[MCCONNEL@ GRIN2.B ITNET]
about replacing this meal with a sec-
ond night of chicken patty pannesan
in the six week rotation. You can also
till out comment cards at the dining
hall. Let your voice be heard. “WE

This is a self-gov-
erning society!
Last time over
1200 patties were
served in Cowles
aloner Fish plat-
ter? No thanks. (0
stars until CF? is
served!)

We re»
sent the fact that
the fries were
taken away from Wednesday lunch.
Now all that is remotely edible is the
potatosaladand broccoli cheese soup.
Looks like a day for PBEIJ and ce-
real; 1, Wednesday dinner is a treat
for vegetarians because of the harvest
burgers. (¥¥ 1/2)

Thursday lunch no clue, al-
though the chocolate chip cookies
are good. Thursday dinner is a treat.
Jason, being ever soresourceful, likes
to take the mesquite chicken breast
and put it in the big burger bun. We
ﬁnd it slightly amusing that they call
this a big burger since we know of a
little place in Altoona that serves a
four pound hamburger. Mmmm
heart attack! (¥¥¥)

Just when you thought it was
safe to bus your tray

OMIE kids clap when it hap
S pens: I shake my head the

student workers shake their
heads " Sandy Gulick. student
employee supervisor at Quad dining
hall, shakes her head now and laughs.
“You know, I bet you could take a
poll: What’s the mostfamiliarsound
in Quad?"

I sit perched on an old desk chair
beside her, scribbling down her
quotes. She doesn't continue; she’s
waiting for me to speak. “Well. aside
fromtalkingandchewing...uh,breake
ing dishes?" I guess.

She nods affirma-
lively.

This has been arecord-
breaking year irl more ways
than one. (And yes, of
course the pun was in-
tended). So far this school
year,Gulicksays, lOOsoup
bowls. 50 monkey dishes
(those tiny bowls). 75
plates.about50saucersand
220 glasses have been bro-
ken. Those numbers beat
last year’s total:

Nadeem Siddiqui, the assistant
director for Quad. says the glass
breakagelsmore lhantwice theusual
number. Over [all break, 200 new
glasses were taken out of storage to

compensate for the damage

According to Dave McConnell,
director of dining services, the typi-
cal place setting costs about $15.

“This year has been very, very
bad." saidGulickr “This is my founh
year and this is the most I have ever
seen broken in such a short period of
time And it's not even ﬁnals week!"
Even students, she said, are as-
tounded.

Siddiqui agreed that he has heard
more comments from juniors and
seniors about the breaking dishes.

The Cowles staff, on the other
had. say they haven’t noticed any-
thing out of the ordinary this year.

Broken Dishes in Quad, Fall ’94

Soup

 

Comic Stewart, student employee
supervisor. says.“lt’sjuslone of those
things. We really don‘t have too
much trouble with breakage here."
Differences in the trafﬁc pat-
terns and tray breakdown systems at

the two dining halls probably ac~
countfor thediscrepency. AtCowles,
the incoming and outgoing eaters
don‘t meet each other as often. In
Quad. dishes are broken most often
behind the partition when students
bus their trays and place them on the
racks. Gulick says.

One Quaddining sophomore
said, “I didn't know there were two
trays already in the tray rack. sol
shovedmineinandheardabigcmsh."

Gulick then demonstrates the
proper way to hold a tray when bus-
sing it, because people who try to
balance trays while bussing are also
likely culprits. “You should rest the
tray against your hip or put
yourartnunderit."Gulick
advises. “I guess if they
justslowed downalittlem
Give each other some
room." And at the salad
bar, “Make sure the tray is
completely on the rails."

Siddiqui says he
has noticed that people
hang on more tightly to
theirtraysafterdisheshave
justbeen broken. “Maybe
we should have some sort
[shattering] noisein there every three
minutes " he jokes.

pressed tolerance for accidents At
