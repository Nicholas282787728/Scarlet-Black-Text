WE TAKE pleastiie in announcing
the election of the sub editors whose
names appear above. Several 01
these have been doing faithful, con-
scientious work on the paper through-
out the year, and to them is due a
double measure of praise. To those
who are now for the ﬁist time be-
come of our number we extend .1
cordial greeting.

BY REQUEST of the chairman ot the
Faculty committee on Athletics, we
publish in another column the athlet-
ic rules adopted by the faculty this
tall. 111 the main they remain as be
fore, but there are several minor
changes which are of some impor-
tant. A11 examination of them will
show that they are very fair and coni-
plete, evidencing how entirely it is the
intention of the governing body of
our institution to be just in all things
that regard the interests of the stu-
dents. All members, or piospecuve
members, of the college athletic teams
will do well to read tlies rules over
carefully and govern their actions do
cordingly. ‘

THE REPORT of the action of our
repiesentativc on the W. l. A. A. in
accordance with instructions tiom the
Athletic Union shows how eminently
ﬁt Mi, Willtston is to occupy this po-
sition. lt Giinnell wishes to take
this stand in regard to the matter I“
question no better move could have
been made, We have now ample
opportunity to give it at least a fair
test in the minds of the various instir
tutions of the Association. While
SCARLET AND BLACK can not speak
authoritatively for the Union \1e.
wish to express 0111 personal thanks
to M1. Willistoii loi his wise and
careful attention to the best interests

The New Football Rules.
The committee appointed at the
athletic conference of delegates lron'i
westei 11 universities have reported and
submitted changes in the'football rules
for 1898 to be adopted by the leading

, westei 11 schools.

There are few changes, the priiicir
ple ones being, that the side scored
upon has the privilege of making or
receiving the succeedingt kick-oft.
Points ili Scoring will be cotiiitEd:
goal from ﬁeld kick, four; g'oal from
place kick, three; touchdowns, tailing
goal, four; safety by opponents, two;
goal from touchdown, one. Before

, the ball is put in play no player will

be allowed to touch, or iii any way
intei'liei'e with his opponent. On a
kick the side receiving the ball will
not be permitted to interfere with the
hands, Ol' ms, 01 by any other foul
means. Whenevei the rules provide
for a peiialty,if the distance presciibed
would carry the ball nearer than the
tiveryard line, the ball shall be down
on the tive-yaid line, except that il’
the foul be committed inside the min
yard line. half the distance to the
goal line shall be given.

The Cornell University Glee Club
has otlei‘ed a prize of Sit) foi every
new song submltted and accepted by
the club commitee.

A noticeable thing in regard to thc
eaStei 11 colleges is that the enrollment
in the fiesliman class of Yale and
many other boys’ colleges is lower
than ‘it was last year, while in the
gii ‘ colleges. Vassar, Smith and Bai-
iiard, it is much laiger.7Ex.

A baseball league has been organ»
ized by Northwestern, Michigan, Chi-
cago, Illinois and Wisconsin. A
schedule of games has been arranged
and the championship is to be de
cided by percentage.

111 all the Univei ities of France
there exist no papers, no glee clubs,
nn fraternities, no athletics and they
have no commencement exercises.

Owing to the refusal of the undei'v
graduate committee on discipline to
exercise its power of expulsion. North—
western University has gone back to
tactilty government.
