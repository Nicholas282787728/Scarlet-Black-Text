January 11-20. students Will be inVib
ed to return from vacation early and
participate in a series of intensive
three-day institutes covering many

Professor Bradley Bateman is instruct-

Grinnellians who became leaders

Social Gospel is lost today, the Grin—

Science department I
adapts to construction

While students and faculty look
forward to the renovations beingdone
to the science building, many stu—
dents expressed disappointment that
construction will take so long.

Katrina Young, ‘97. best ex—
pressed the attitude on campus about
the construction; “It’s kind of a burn»
mer now but it will be nice when it‘s
done." RogetWang, ’98, is annoyed
because he “has to walk around stuff
and put up with the noise." Stu—
dents also expressed concern over
when the improvements will be felt,
“l'mkinda bummed that the changes
won’t happen rill my junior otsenior
year," said John Christiansen, ‘98,

Students also worry about labs
opening on time, Many physics labs
are not in use this week. Adam
Rinehart reported that the Modern
Lab is off till the physics labs are
ready. Coordinator of construction
JimSwartzrespondedtothedelays in
labs by explaining that few physics
labs are normally held the first week.
He said the physics labs should be up
by next week so the labs can resume
normally. “No classes or labs will
interrupted,” said Swartz. Credit for

and the science building personnel.
“'I'hecontractorshave worked around
the needed lab areas." said Swartz.
He also added that the rebuilt blolo»
gy labs will be moved into during Fall
Break and iti one month students
will see walls going up for the addi—
tion.

New lights have been put up
around the science building to make
up for those removed by constnic—
tion. An assault occurred in an area
by the science building darkened by
construction last week. Swartz said
the assault unfortunately fell “In the
lag time between the old lights going
down and the temporary lights being
put up." “There is now more light
out there than it was before," Swartz
added.

Construction is behind because
Orinnell College did not anticipate
the huge construction rush in Gene
ttal Iowa. ”Construction is up 1000
percent. said Swartz, and so prices
rose far beyond what the expected
bid was.” When thefirstbidscamein
they were more expensive then ex—
pected and so changes had to be
made intheconsttuctionplant “The
final contract was not reached until
school ended, the day work was sup-
posed to begin," said Koenig. Con—

This year's crop of new students
mayseemsparseto thnnellvetetans
used to tire record—sized class admit»
tedtwoyearsagofotthe‘93-’94 school
year, but, according to college offi—
clals,it’sactuallyanormalsizedclass.

Gtitinell admitted about 360
new students this year (final figures
aren‘t released until the tenth day of
class, after late arrivals and early de—
partures are mostly taken care of),
which Vice President of Enrollment
JamesLincoln callsa“perfectlysized"
class to maintain the college's total
enrollment goal of about 1260 stu—
dents.

For the ‘93—’94 school year, the
college admitted well over 400 stu—
dents, a school record for the size ofa
new class, which pushed the total
enrollment to 1333 students for that
year, and had the repercussion last
year of creating an enrollment of
1306 students. This strained the
college's housing system, making it
necessary to convert lounges in resi»
dence halls into rooms and make
slightly large doubles into very

cramped triples.

For this year, President Pam Fer—
guson mandated a conscious effort to
keep the size of the new class down.
The college tries to control its en»
rollment by examining historical data
on the percentage of admitted stu—
dents who actuallydecide to come to
Grinnell, then admitting a number
of students that should, given that
percentage, create a class of the de—
sired size. This year. that method
worked.

Director of Housing Oda Callit
son. who is responsible for ﬁrsttyenr
room assignments, says that helped
her to have “a much nicer summer"
than the past two summers, whenshe
had to create the afore-mentioned
sardinelike rooming arrangements
This year, she was able to turn the
lounge—rooms back into regular
lounges, and even to create a few new
lounges in Norris. Many second»
year students may also have noticed
that the room they were crammed
into with two other roommates last
year holds only a pair of this year‘s
first—years.
