Hungarian Musician at Grinnell
to Learn ‘American Pipe Organ’

A ﬁnished European musician,
coming to the United States not to
give highly press-agented concert
tours, but to study quietly and
learn more about music:

An unheard of “upset in the dope.”
as a sports writer would say. But
that is just what Miss Izabellc de
Dedinszky is doing in coming from
the royal academy of music at Budar
pest to the school of music at Grim
nell college.

Miss dc Dedinszky. member of an
historic family of Hungarian nobil-
ity, is a graduate of the royal acad-
erny of music and a pianist and pipe
organist of note on the continent.

PLAYERS MEET
The ﬁrst meeting of the Grime“
chapter of National Collegiate Flt-1y»
ers was held Thursday evening. Sev-
eral plays were read and plans were
discussed for the program of the or-
ganization this year. James Clarke
is president.

Then why has she come to Gl'innell?
Bigger, Better Pipe Organs

“Oh! It is because I want to learn
all about your Amer-roan pipe or—
gal-is,” she says. “They are so much
bigger and better than the pipe or
gans we have in Europe, and you
have so many of them. Not just in
your cathedrals, hut in your thea»
ters, the places for funerals, every»
where.”

As a result of the larger organs
built in this country, their many
manuals and stops, a very different
character of music can he played on
them than on the European organs,
she says. A variety of effects that
gives lightness and elasticity in
contrast to the comparatively heavy
and stiff composition suitable to
continental organs can he obtained,

cure of 100 European Students

In addition to her study of the
American pipe organ, which will be
under the direction of Hugo Good-
win, professor of organ and compo»
sition, Miss de Dedinszky will study
American music in other branches,
composition, methods, etc.

She is one of the approximately
100 European graduate students who
have come to the United States this
year under the auspices of the coun~
cil of international education to
study in American universities and
colleges on an exchange fellowship
basis. Students from this c‘ountry
are going abroad to study in the
schools from which these European
scholars have come.

Miss de Dedinszky, the ﬁrst such
student to come to G'rinnell, comes
from a family that has distinguished
itself in arts and letters, one of the
most noted being a cousin, J.
Bencsrrr, whose landscape and histor.
ical paintings hang in several Eur—
open art galleries.

Towns For Apart

Coming almost directly to Grin-
nell after- arriving in this country,
Miss de Dedinszky. who s‘peaks ex-
cellent English, said that the thing
that impressed her most as she
passed through the country was the
distance between towns.

“You can actually get out into the
country so far that you cannot see
from one village to another," she
said. “That is what seemed strange
est to me."

Grinnell, Drake, Iowa Form
Hawkeye Competition

for Hilltoppers

(Special to The Scarlet and Bloch)

MILWAUKEEiNme teams from
six states are listed as opponents of
the Marquette university Golden
Avalanche football team for the 1930
season, and a preseason survey in-
dicates that Coach Frank J. Murray
and his gridiron proteges will he
called upon for tip—top performances
in every game this fall.

Three teams from Iowa, Crinnell,
Drake, and Iowa, are among the fea—
tures on the 1930 schedule, while
Lawrence and Bipon are Wisconsin
elevens to be met. Creighton from
out in Nebraska. Boston college in
Massachusetts. University of Detroit
from Michigan, and Butler from Ind-
iana round out the coming campaign.
‘ Three New Coaches

Opponents which Marquette has
drawn for this fall all appear to be
well fortiﬁed. Three of the teams will
have new coaches, with Eddie Kotal
assuming command at Lawrence;
Art Stark at Creighton. and Harry
Bell at Butler. "Fuzz" Watt remains
at Griunell; Ossie Solem at Drake;
Carl Doehling at Ripon; Joe McKen»
ney at Boston; Burt Ingwe-rsen at
Iowa, and Gus Dorais at Detroit.

Although Lawrence has lost seven
sterling letter men, Coach Kotal will
have a ﬁne nucleus for 1930 in such
men as Bickle and Schneller, tackles;
Fhenicie, end; Hovde, Vincent, and
Coffey, guards; Morton, center, and
Bames, Trankle, and Ryan, backs.
There also are some splendid sopho-
mores. Ripon, the other Badger
school on the Marquette schedule.
looks for thirteen veteran letter men
and will boast a strong line. The
Redmen open with Chicago. Oct. 4.

Grinneu Stumbling Block

Iowa sends three formidable op-
ponents for the Avalanche. Grinnell
always has been a stumbling hlock
for the Murray men. and the Pion-
eer depend on nine returning letter
men as their 1930 nucleus, not to
mention several 1929 reserves and at
least a dozen sophomores of undoubt—
ed varsity calibre. With Capt. Benny
Douglas, Ruff, Humphrey, and Min—
ier hack in the fold, Crinnell again
will have a powerful passing attack,

Coach Watt-s team opens the sea-
son against Marquette. Drake, al—
ways dangerous, will be headed by
that versatile athlete, Lynn’ King,
while other vets include Van Koten,
Brewer. McMichael, Seiberling, and
Goodwin in the backﬁeld, and Don
Carlos, Robertson, Risser, Olson and
Faber on the line.

Ineligibility Hits Iowa

Iowa has‘been hard hit by ineligi-
bility. but the Hawkeyes will have
three veteran hacks, Leo and Lloyd
Jensvold and Sansen, and six letter
men on the line, Ely. Benjamin, Rage
ge, Reedquist, Mastrogany, and Big
don. There also will he sixteen minor
letter men and a dozen ﬁne sopho—
mores on hand. Twelve letter men

were lost from last year.

The Bluejays from Omaha, CreigII-v
ton, handed Marquette a defeat when
least expected last fall and the Hill»
toppers will be out to avenge that
setback. Prospects are uncertain at
the western school and the new-
coaching staff will be under test
from the start. However, Coach
stark is not altogether without ex-
perienced material as he has Co.
Capts. Burger and Tesar, Frrray, and’
Holland on the line, and Wee Willie
Worthing, Scott, and McConville in
the backﬁeld. The Jays expect great
things from a pair of sophomore
ends, Dugan and Smith.

Brazil Lost to Detroit

University of Detroit had easy
sailing for three seasons until tied
by Marquette last fall, but the Titans
have lost several men from that
strong eleven, the great Lloyd Bra.
zil among them. The Titans had a
spring turnout of 132 boys, so Gus’
Dorais should not be wanting for mz-v
terial. Vets back in the fold will he
Hackett, an end; Schimrner and M55»

and Brown, guards; Howell, center:

Storen, fullback, thirteen in all.
