Valentine’s Day is
by far my least
favorite holiday No, I
didn’t forget about
Arbor Day. Unlike all
the other holidays,
which are spent with
family members who
are required by law
and nature to love
you, Valentine's Day
calls for love of a
more fleeting and
obscure make. To
truly enjoy the
holiday, you must be
in a solid, trust-based,
communication-
intensive relationship
with a guy who will
probably turn out to
be gay,

To make things
harder, males tend to
despise Valentine’s
Day with their entire
chocolate-covered
foil-wrapped 312.99
Hallmark Special
hearts. Around early
February, one will
notice many boys
breaking up with their
girlfriends on the
basis of ”just wanting
to be friends" or
"needing more time."
What these boys really
want to say is,
"although I want you
to beat my children
and although I will
love you forever, even
when you are old and
have saggy oldrlady
forearms, ljust can’t
ﬁnd itin me to buy
you dinner and
ﬂowers on a holiday
that doesn't even
involve planting
trees" of course, I’m
assuming that boys
remember the holiday
at all.

Some people claim
that Valentine's day is
not just about
romantic love They
say that the holiday is
a time to celebrate all
types or love, ranging
from the platonic to
the familial. These
people obviously
either have signiﬁcant
others or warped
realitiesr The truth is,
even if you attempted
to spend time with
your best-loved non-
carnal friend, she
would be busy either
ﬁnding a big enough
vase for her absurd
bouquet of roses or
writing angstrfilled
poetry about the guy
who dumped her so he
wouldn’t have to
locate said bouquet.

So I'm going to
hold out on any kind
of celebration of love
until the springs
Arbor Day isjust a few
months away.

Bill Frisell's album exemplifies
debate over whatjazz is

by Garrett Shelton
Sioff Writer

With an cstimarcd i2 million pcoplc having
tuned into cvcry episode of Ken Burns' cpic docur
mcntary, “Jazz," it appears (hat America's ptogtcs»
siyc apathy towards its richcst musical tradition has
been slightly abated, Despite the populariry or the
documentary, Burns has bccu vilincd by many in
the music world for the choice to essentially and his
history at 1960, excluding many or Jazz's greatest
artists. By followmg a narrow traditionalist inter»
prctation (inﬂuenced heavily by his scnior consult.
ant Wynton Marsohs), many feel he put bookcnds
on the music. However, Burns and the controversy
surrounding his documentary has done something
great for thc m usic—thc debate over “What is Jazz?"
is no longer purcly the domain orthc Jazz literati,
Ken Burns created a space for this debate in arena of
American popular culturc whether hc (or Marsalis)
wanted to or not.

There are very few artists that exemplify the dc.
bstc over “What is Jazz?" bcttcr than Bill Frisell. A 20»ycat Vctv

Friscll has made his career with : genteebcnding style, which ran
duccs the term “jazz” to arbitrary nomenclature. We learned in
Bums’ documentary that Duke Ellington disliked the term “Jazz"
as be viewed it as limiting [11's music. As with Duke, thc primary
concern or Frisell’s art is an aspect of
American life—for Ellington it was the
lives of MticanvAmeticans, with Frisell
is the prairie, rural An-icrimn life.

Without argument, Bill Frisell has
craned a musical voice so unique that
anyone who would try and take from it
would be seen us derivative and shallow.
With Frlsell, the guitar is a wind instru-
mcnt. Thc ﬂoating, intimate qualmes or
his sound are usually characteristics as-
sociated with horn players. Using a very
light attack, chords appear out or thin
air and linget like wispy clouds. Thc si.
lcnccs of Bill Friscll's music resonate as loudly as the notes do.
