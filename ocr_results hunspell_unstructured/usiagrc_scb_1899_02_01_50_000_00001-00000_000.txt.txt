Elation;

Meeting of the Athletic Union
Fiiday afternoon at one o'clock.
A full attendance desired.

There tvill be a business meet-
ing of the v. w. c. A. in the Clta»
pel at 2:00 l> ii , Saturday. Every
active member ottlie association is
urgently requested to be present.

In place of the usual Thursday
night prayerrmcetillg, Mr. Trine
has kindly consented to spealr to
the girls this (Wednesday) evens
ing. at 6:30 o'clock.

Mr,

The ttvo chapel talks of Mr.
Trine last Sunday were full of
suggestive thoughts, practical,
optitlosophical and religious. In a

‘” vefy plain and untirteeted manner.
with almost no change of attitude
or even of voice throughout both
ttis tailts,'1\'ir.'liine set tjrth some
of his ideas on llie,7ideas which
have been called idealistic and
transcendental but which. never-
theless, were logically given and
well-worth hearing. '

The two addresses were upon
much the same general theme,
though the evening one was per
haps a little simpler than the one
given in the afternoon.

Thought is the essential source
of all being and of the whole ob-
jective world. Thought is there
fore the moulding force of individ-
ual character. The progress ot
all life is from within outward.
from the thotiglit which is real to
its outward manifestation which is
unreal, being but a reﬂection or
shadow of the thotight within.
Now the individual by the excr»
tion of his wtll may determine the
direction ol his thought, and iti so
far as he correlates his thought
with the divilie, which is present
in him by the infusion of the life
of God into all ltis creatures, in so
far as he tltus ﬁnds his center in
Deity, his character will be of
power tor the lifting up or men.
Success is service. But the indi-
vtdual can impart to men only so
much of the divine as is in him-
selt. He can preach or write or
sing only himseit. The informs
ing principle of service is love, as
that is the highest manifestation
of the divine. By the free ex-
pendilure of love only and always,

Trlne.

the individual attains the highest
success of service to his fellow-
men and is himselt most largely
enriched by its reaction upon him.
As thought shapes character so it
shapes also physical conditions of
the body; and it acts directly and
without the spoken word upon
other individuals Thought, in
short, determines personality.
Self mnstbe assertive. Any yield-
ing to eonventionality or opinion,
or tea. of offense, any contribur
tion to the "mush of concession,"
is a degradation of the highest
manhood and a limitation of the
possibilities oi service.

There is certainly transcendent
alism here in the unreality ot the
external world, and something ot
Fichtean idealism in God's life in
every man. There is a rather
reckless minimizmg or heredity
and environment in the insistence
on the—sovereignty or the will
There is a recognition of sortie of
the newest scientiﬁc theories in
the direct tiansnitssion of thought.
But many of us are believers in
all this, and even to those of us
who are not, Mr. Trine's addresses
must commend themselves foi
their essentially christian tone. for
the highest idea of manhood arid
its responsibilities, for the beauttr
liilly simple and in many ways
natural theory of life presented.

Monday evening Mr. Trine
spoke again to the students, de-
voting his time to answering ques-
tions on religious and social sub
jects His answers were found
interesting and instructive by all
present

Grinnell institute.

Tliesamegeneralcriticismwhich
was made last week can beapplied
to the meeting of last Saturday
niglitithere were too many mem-
bers absent. As a rule the indi-
vidual members who have a part
on the program are on hand and
are taithtul in the work assigned
but they would be stimulated to
much better work if they could
have the inspiration of knowing
that maiiy arelistentngto and ap-
preciating their eflttrts.

A lively character sketch, de-
pictintz the life and habits of Sen»
ator Quay, was given, without
manuscript. by Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Thompson lollowed With an
interesting paper on “Recent Der

 

velopnients in the Saudan.”

 

The cxtemporaneous work oil

the evening was fully up to the
standard. Mr. Cratidall.,lna very
original and humorous way, gave
2 “Lecture on Etiquette," Mr.
Frisbie gave somegood advice on
“How the Standard of Society
Work may be Raised." “Ought
the Standing Army be increased
ioo.ooo," was creditably treated
by Swan.

The subject for debate
Resolved, “Thatthepcoplc oftlie
United States would bc better
served by acabinet system similar
to that of Great Britain rather
than by the present one.” Higgs
and Whitley supported the annihi-
ative while Otis and Waterman
upheld the negative. Waterman
apoke extemporancously in the
place ot Coggeshall who was abs
sent. The debate. which was of
unusual interest, because of the
number of volunteers on each side,
Lab clouded in favor of the afﬁrm
alive.

After the critic's report, by Mr.
Knapp. the society resolved itselt
tiito a business meeting and hope-
tul plans and projects were dis»
cussed. After a good natured
mental sparring match between
certain members of the Junior
class and other members of the In
stitute, it ivas decided to allow the
Junior class exclustve use ot the
hall Saturday night with the pro-
viso that they should furnish the
program at the next regular meet-

President Crabb called the so
ciety to order at 7:55 Saturday
evening, and the program was
opened immediately.

Mi. Thiel, one of the new meni-
bcrs of the socieiv, read a well-
written paper on Voltaire. The
ﬁrst part of the discussion was tip-
on the value and position of Val—
taire's writings. and also deﬁned
the standpoint from which his
works should be judged, The lat»
ter part of the paper contained a
biographical sketch of Voltaire's
lite,coveringtheimportantpoints.

Mr. Meade tavnred the society
with a chapel talk. He pretaced
his remarks by saying that his art
dress was intended only for major
philosophy students, and
nouuced his subject as Mystical

Phenomena. It proved to be u
