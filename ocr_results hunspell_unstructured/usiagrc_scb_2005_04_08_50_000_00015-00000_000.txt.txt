Q: How war rile earpm'em: quetionn/r!
A: Lots of fun.

Q: Hn’w did this yztzrfr Lamp/Ire to previous
ones?

Ale-lis year 1 did norfoel much pressure going
into the meet at all. I’d spent ﬁrst semester abroad
in Costa Rica and I’d not trained over the summer
much, so I didn't have expectations for the season.
I just started training in lanuarywtth the team and
thought I’d give it my best shot and see how much
I would remember. Plus, the meet itself was a lot
of fun because I knew several of the girls there who had been at
Nationals in the past and, after a few years ofsecing each other, we
were pretty comfortable. Also, there were two girls from our confers
one: who were at the meet, so it wasn’t like I was just competing on
my own. It’s obviously nothing compared to actual teammates who
you train with, but they're niee, familiar fates who cheer for you that
helps keep a fun atmosphere.

Q: W11: it iii/ﬁrm! going to dim wit/writ tmarellr'rlg will) [[12
team?

A: Yes, but it's like that every year at Nationals. so that was no
surprise. What was really nice about this year was having two girls
from the Midwest Conference go.They‘re not teammates, but they
are afﬁliated with the region that we all represent, and that’s at least
one excuse to bond together. ,

Q: Wbet: [be most dryfimit dive you attempt, and Lmlldyml err
ﬁlm'll it 11 little bit?

A: The hardest thve I do is a back 1 1/2 ﬂip with 2 1/2 twist
off the three meter diving homd.The way you set it up is to start a
back ﬂip, then begin to twist upside down 2 1/2 times so you end
up faeing out towards the pool away from the board. and to ﬁnish
the dive you simply bend over and try to pop your heels above your
headt'l'hc hard part about it is that there are simply a lot of motions
to get done and not much tune to finish it ,all in. Plus, you need to

have the twist finish squarely, otherwise you won’t know where you
are and you just splat on the water.

Q: Emielt did/z?

A: The easiest dive, and probably the prettiest one that I do, is
a back dive pike. It's so simple, but ifyou do it Weill think it looks
so elegant. Youjustjump up in the air and bring your feet up so you
touch your toes, but you hang there forjust a moment in perfect bale
anee.Then your body slides away so you're inverted while your feet
just hang in the air and you drop into the water.

Q: Malt "windmill: event...

A: My eoaeh brought some rubber'poo to the

» meet and it looks very real and I put it on ground

on the diving deck and really freaked a lot of the

,. other girls out and we all had a good laugh about
it.

Q: How ([021 it feel to be at AlIrAmen'ttm .2
A:When I found out that I had made the finals
and ms an Alermetlcnn, 1 was literally jumping
up and down on the pool deck. 1 wasso exerted. It’s
deﬁnitely something that I’m proud of. But really,
it feelsabout the sarne as before when l wasnr an Alharneritan.

Q: wear isyottrfm/orilepartttbtnttguing to Nationals?

A:That’s hard [0 explaintlt'sjust a vely interesting meet beeanso
it's just a few days that are all about you, Your couches, rho people
that run the meet, even the other competitors are all very supports
ive and enthusiastic. So almost anybody will do anything they are
capable of to make sure that you perform the best that you can. for
lack ofa better word, you really feel spoiled by the whole etperienee.
All your worries just get put on hold and all you need to focus on is
diving, which is really a lot offun.

Quito/preempt rihiulx/Suftn‘titinnl?

A: 1 have a set of adopted grandparents in Grinnell that gave
me a small goodvluck teddy bear before my sophomore year ofNar
tionals. I keep that in my bag always. And also, more by accident,
really, that ritual, I always seem to forget something rather impor~
tilntil'lkc my entire swim bag my freshman year.

Q: W/Jtltareybltrgnttllfor tlextyettr?

A: Very simply to see how the season goes and do the best I tan.

Though I wouldn't mind being Alermerican both boards ifit came
down to it.
