Grinnoll u ll not meet other cell
on the basaball diamond this year
The news comes suddenly because we
have not thought much about the ques»
tion lately, but it is a decision arrived
at only otter long consideration,

Last winter the agitation started
which sought to abolish the sport. The
Board oi Control and Faculty soon let
it be known under what conditions
baseball would be abolished and left
it up to the student body to change
those conditions. The Faculty Drab-
ably has been able to see no change,
consequently the decision.

This does not abolish baseball. it
will still he lound here, but not as an
intercollegiate sport. Great dreams
are being worked out loi- making it‘l
one of the most prominent at all
sports. it is hoped that it may be the
means oi giving every man in the in.
stitution his lust due ot physical
training which seems somewhat imr
possible, A great system or intra-
mural baseball might be developed
here. which would give every man in
the institution his proper share of
physical training.

linlpli .llooi-lil-ad.

The second issue of the Grliiilell
blast iiic came out today as a special
Christmas number. The cover is col-
orcd and designed appropriate to the
yuletide season.

The contents or the issue have all
been contributed by Gi-lniiellians and
extend over a large variety or sub—
jects. One of the most novel articles
which it contains is the “Letter From
the Border," by Ralph Mom-head. It
is especially interesting because or the
humorous way in which he describes
the army llfciin Texas.

Two articles are leatured iii this i5r
sue. Gun is by President Main, “shall
the Number 0: Students in Grinnell Be
Liiliited7”. and the other is “Harvard
As Seen By a Griunell Man," by Paul
Smith, '15. Twelve other articles, all
pertinent to Griiinell life, complete the

CDinglﬂLO SDOK‘L

Student sentiment this tall has becll‘
dli tried on the subject or baseball, but
as prospects tor a winning nine next
spring have been brighter than in
years, many lowered the callliuuallcei
oi the sport. As new diamonds are
promised, it is certain that added in-
centlve will be given to class and in-
Ll‘avcldss baseball, which will result in‘
a greater realization of thc Grinnell
ideal oi athletics for every member oi
the college body. ‘

) or Be Taken Up t \'

As the action taken by the tacultyl
was binding tor but one year, it is
possible that baseball will be rares-
tahlishcd in 1913. What action is tak-
en then will depend largely on the suc-
cess ot the track season next spring,
and how that success or failure is re-
lated to the dropping of baseball. The
interest taken in intramural baseball
will also he considered when the ques-
tion comes up again.
