ment of peoples that the world has
ever seen.” He also outlined the steps
by which the West became settled.

First, he said, came the fur trader
who might be called the V“ttdvl\nce
agent of civilization." This trader
while he maintained connections with
eastern capital. and kept the more
civilized section of the country posted
on the developments on the frontier,
was conquered by this environment. He
adopted the dress, and habits or the
Indians with whom he of necessity as-
sociated.

Next came the pioneer, who accord-
ing to Professor Mark, withstood the
influence of the wilderness; although
he simplified and modified his eastern
mode of life to suit his surroundings
he did not relinquish it in favor of the
Indian life as the trader had done.

Finally, came the scientific farmer.
who, declared Professor Merit, con.
quoted the wilderness and laid the
foundations for city life.

Toward the close of his speech the
professor stated the fundamental dif-
ferences between the East and West.
The East, he said, ls essentially cun-
servauve. orthodox, and very solicitous
for its property rights, while the West
is progressive, unorthodox, and ready
to take the initiative in any new move-
ment, regardless of consequences.

Ideals Come From Cohesion.

In conclusion Professor Mark stated,
“out of the cohesion of frontier ideals
with eastern ideals we have developed
what is most characteristic of our
present civilization."

The professor illustrated his lecture
with a group of twelve slides, portray—
ing on maps the trend of westward ex-
pansion from 1660 to 1890.

Professor Mel-k, who succeeds Prof.
Ralph Barton Perry as Harvard ex-
change lecturer, will give nine more
lectures on “The History of the West"
in the A. R. H. auditorium, His next
lecture will he Thursday night at 7:15,

Talbott, Stock Speak
To Scientists Monday

Yellowstone park as the ”savage
and the “ranger" see it was presented
to the Science club Monday night by
Bernice Stock and Robert Talbott.

A savage, Bernice Stock told the
club, is a young person who works in
the Yellowstone camps. ”We got
fifteen dollars a month. not enough to
pay our cariare." Miss Stock said.
"but I would pay the camp people to
the privilege of going back again next
summer.”

Talbott told about his life as a rang-
er. The rangers are admired by the
tourists as speciments of the rough
\lnscllouled west, but most of them
really come from eastern colleges.

In a business meeting of the club,
the Psychology department was electe
ed as eligible to membership.

Psychology Laboratory
Supplements Lectures

Work in the psychology laboratory is
getting under way now and is used to
supplement the class lectures, just as
the work in other science laboratories
illustrates their class lectures. The
beginning psychology classes have one
three hour laboratory period each week
and are now studying the simple re»
tlexes.

This year another instructor, Prof.
Milton Wittler, was added to the psy-
chology department, making it pos~
sible for students to major in psy-
chology. Four new courses, Adolescent
Psychology, Mental Hygiene, an ad-
vanced course in Experimental Psy-
chology, and Systems of Psychology

' were added this year.

Much of the equipment of the labor—
atory was made durlng the summer
under the direction of Prof. L. C. Dongs
lass who spent his vacation in Grin—
nell organizing the new laboratory.

Blacks 'l‘T'lm Reds By
13-7 Score Saturday

In one of the most colorful fresh-
man battles in recent years, the Blacks
trimmed the Beds 13 to 7, in a game
heIore the Homecoming crowd Satur-
day morning. Captain Humphrey of
the Reds scored their lone touchdown
when he caught along pass thrown by
Ekwall. Douglas made both tallies for
the Blacks.

Although the Black team clearly had
the edge during the whole ‘game, the
Reds put up a fight which left the re.
suit in doubt until the final minutes
when their opponents marched down
the ﬁeld and were denied a score onr
ly by the gun which closed the con-
test.

lLamb Writes Letter
i Of His Experiences

5 Curtis Lamb. who graduated from
Grlnnell last year, is now teaching in
the American college at Charilaos.
'Salonica, Greece. The following is a
letter he wrote to Prof. J, M. Smith,
head or the Romance language ne-
partment, concerning his sojourn in
Europe last summer:

‘ Thursday, Sept. 22, '27.
Dear Mr. Smith,

Thank you for accepting my word
that I would hand in the overdue
‘report on the romance. I think the
enclosed work Will satisfy the require~
ments of the occasion.

You might be interested in firsthand
information from one of your students
with regard to whether Grinnell col—
lege nench qualifies the student for
‘travclling abroad. I can say that on
the whole French has been more ser—
,viceable than my native tongue, the
English language. In fact, most of
the time last summer. I served as in-
terpreter for our foursome, and on
various accasiuns for other people too.
Whether or not my case is typical, I
feel amply repaid for all the French
work I ever took.

May I also endorse the method of

teaching. For perhaps a majority,
French as the spoken word is uninter-
esting in college because there is lit
tle hope for a later use of it. Liter-
ature attracts, and I think I continued
my French work primarily for that
reason. In that fashion vocabulary
is developed, and if there is an occas-
ional lesson in phonetics and speak-
ing; or if the professor conducts the
class entirely in French fairly often, a
sufficient knowledge of how to speak
French is potentially, at least, in the
student's brain; and I, for one, found
no difficulty in bringing that know-
ledge lnto action.
3 But enough of the pedagogical side
‘of this summer’s trip. I had the good
fortune to stay in Paris with sFrench
family, or rather to take my meals
with a group that spoke only French
and included business and professional
men. Our hostess had the nerve to
laugh at my name, ”Lamb," because
translated into French lt signified
”Agneau," while on the other hand,
I think I had the good sense not to
suggest at the table the American
equivalent of her name, "Madame
Fromage.” We had lots of good fun
there, but I was just getting a few
of the French words oiled for use, and
was much more a listener then a
speaker.

Charles Parish, a member of our
party, was going down the main street
of Heldleberg ‘when he pulled what the
boys considered the “brightest saying"

-0f the trip. Chuck has had a. year 0!

German, and as the boys were walking

 

along ( I was in Paris at the time)
Chuck spotted a sign in a store win-
dow. ”Hey Iellowsl" he yelled, "wait
a minute! Here‘s another German
word I can read." But in spite of this
incident, which became the stock joke
of our quartet, Charles was usually
able to get what he wanted in Ger-
many.

There were some difficulties in
writing the report I enclose, not al—
together in the material itsell, al—
though looklng up words was a inbor-
ious task, but because the scenery was
so wonderlul at that time. You see, I
did most of the work on the deck or a
freighter between Naples and Salonlca,
where islands capped with Greek tem-
ples, or cities plastered on some dis—
tant mountain—side, were continually
visable. But both the work and pleas—
ure of the writing are now forgotten
in the new joy of fulfilling your trust.
With special regards to you and Mrs.

Smith.
Very truly,
Curtis Lamb,
