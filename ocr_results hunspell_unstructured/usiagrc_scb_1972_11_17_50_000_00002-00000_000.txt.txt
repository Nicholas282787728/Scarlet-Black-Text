WOMEN (irom page 1)

”One of the things we hear most
often is that there aren’t any (qual-
ified women)“, explained Ms. Wyly.
she went on to say that last year a
group oi women had gone through
available statistics and found that
there were qualified women who
could be hired by the college.

A committee was iormed last year
to draw up an aiiirmative action pro—
gram ior equal opportunity employ-
ment on the campus which included
faculty, students, physical plant stall
and clerical staff. Ms. Wyly expres-
sed concern and curiousity about this
committee ”What I would like to

know is what ever happened to that

affirmative action program.”
Charles Sellar, Registrar and
Assistant Dean of the College who
headed the committee, answered Ms,
Wyly's question, The committee was
appointed by President Leggett and
held a Series of meetings before d9,
ciding to break up into separate
sub—committees

Communications

by Merry Wiesner

Students and faculty concerned with
the future of the communications de-
partment have drawn up a set of
guidelines, both an explanation oi
the place of communications With~
in the curriculum as a whole and
a set oi speciiic course vital to
the department.

This proposal, involving the Work
of a number of communications ma—
iors and other people who have an
interest in the department, is far
beyond the scope of a standard EPC
report. The students worked with
the cooperation of the iaculty, pure
tioularly at several lengthy meetings
held by Vanderpool, Mrs. Hiser, and
Ms. Kent.

The task force of student work,
ers, including Ann Cassel, Shiiteh
Karimi, Cam Patterson, Reed Elr
drldge, Curt Gorrell, and Mark
Hanisch, spoke to several profeSr
sors in graduate schools of come
munlcation, They solicited opinions
on both the type oi undergraduate
background expected by graduate
schools and changes in the present
curriculum which would better facile
itate a "communications education”
within the liberal-arts focus of the
college. Dr, Frank Dance, of the
University at Colorado atoenver and

ious areas oi college employment,

to be submitted to the full commit-

According to Sellar, most of the
research proiects assigned didn't
seem to be working very well."
The committee broke down about the
middle of last semester.

Sellar gave the reason ior its
lack oi success as confusion among
the members of the committee
Members of the committee viewed
its role as an organization set up
to iind out where orinnell College
stood in terms of equal opportunity
employment and to implement pro-
cedures to forward equal opportune

pus work Many oi the areas which
the committee considered within its

iurlsdiction were being worked on
at the same time by other concerned
groups an campus and members of
the committee generally felt that
there was little reason for the com-
mittee’s existence.

Sellar also blamed the late organ-
ization of the committee for its
breakdown. “Most institutions don’t
get around to establishing a commit-

The faculty seems to value these
ideas sufficiently to listen to them
and note them in the minutes hope,
iully, it will value them enough to
recognize them openly by granting
full membership status to the student

Dr. John K Brilhart, of the Univer-
sity of Nebraska at Omaha, were
both consulted,

The group's basic proposal read
Zis follows:

“We propose that a core group oi
four courses be oiiered every year
and be required oi every major~
“personal and Public Communicar
tion", “Mass Media in Modern So-
ciety", “Interpersonal Communicar
tion,” and a senior seminar. Bee
yond these, we are proposing the
inclusion oi eight supplementary
courses which fit the interests and
needs oi students to provideastrong
acidmic background in this discip-
line ln addition to these, students
will have the options oi“p1us-2’s”,
interliships, and independent studies
to provide more practical experi-
ence in Communications work ”
The communications department
would thus offer a curriculum bale
anced between theory and practical
experience. With this sort of bills
ance it hopes to achieve the pur-
pose stated by Brilhart. He come
ments:

“The primary mission oi a School
of Communications should be to help
students to understand the communir
cation process and to develop skills
therein as practitioners”.

Grinnell Problems Aired

by John Wylie

why do students leave Grinnell?
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman has recently com
pleted the compilation of almost
130 questionnaires which were re»
turned to the conege by departing
students.

While the information currently
available does not provide any iirm
answers, It does show several imp
portant trends. Students Who left
Grinnell did so primarily because
of academic or social difficulties
(financial difficulties were relative,
ly rare) Many areclearlyconfused,
both about their current educational
situation and their goals in his.

Academic Hangups
Several student comments seem to

tee like this until it’s Obvious that it
should have been developed five
years earlier. . . wedon'tthink about
these things until we’re forced into
them.

in her discussion of the situation
oi women on campus, Ms, Wyly men-
tioned briefly that women in secre—
tarial positions at Grinnell are in a
poor situation salary-Wise. ”This
college runs on the hacks oi secre-
taries and these women are paid
dirt.”

Salary is not the only area which
needs attention in the working sit-
nation of the secretarial staff ac-
cording to Rita Tindle, a secretary
in the Registrar’s office. She men—
tioned medical insurance, benefits,
and the little chance for advance
ment in a secretarial position as
other problems.

The reason she sees for these
problems continuing is the lack oi
a consensus or opinion among the
secretarial staff on campus Each
department has different problems
and there is little communication
between secretaries in various de-
partments.

When asked if the college is lg-
noring the problems oi secretar-
ies, Ms Tindle said, “You can't
really say that they're overlooking
them because they haven‘t been
brought to their attention,” Her 50*
lution to this problem involved gets
ting a group oi women who repre
sent the secretarial staff to pref
sent areas of concern to Dean
Walker. But there seemed to be
little possibility of this happening
due to the lack of a consensus of
opinion among the secretarial staff.

Ms. Tindle made it clearthat she
was expressing only her opinionand
the opinion oi a tow other secrer
taries on this matter,

Although there are still some prob-
lems in the situation of women at
Grinnell college and some disconr
tent among women employed here,
most seem to agree that the admin-
istration is trying to create a bet-
ter atmosphere for women and con-
sidering the hiriltg of women as an
important priority But according
to Ms. Noble attitudes toward women
must change beiore goals for women
can become a reality.

Captain John w. Potts oi the stan-
iord, Connecticut Police Depart-
ment gave a numberoipresentndons
this week, both iormalandiniormal.
with 23 years ofpolice experience,
Potts spoke to several classes and
in an open question and answerperr
lad, about c ontrol of drugsand riots,
and police control in general.

sum up the overau dissatisfaction
expressed with Grinnell's academic
program, one student noted that,
“I became discouraged with thepet-
tiness of academics at Grinnell.”

“1 was dissatisfied with the aca-
demic pressure in that I felt that
the most important thing was to
learn something from books" was
the analysis oianotner.

General academic pressure was
decried in one way or another by
many ofthe students who responded
to the questionnaire. Perhaps the
most coherent comment was, “I
found the academic pressure to be
excessive, unreasonable, and tins
bearable. It was all Work and no
time for recreationor relaxation."

However, the majority oistudents
whose major complaint wastheaca»
demic environment were dissatis-
fied because ofthe lack ofa Specific
department. They desired changes
ranging from more Art History
courses to a Nursingprogram, but
most indicated that theydid not ex—
pect such programs from a liberal
arts school like Grinnell.

Programs have now been insisted
at Grinneil whch fill several of
the gaps complained about by de»
parting orinneuians. Several stu-
dents indicated a desire for an ele-
mentary education program; that
problem was remedied at the be-
ginning of this year. others wanted
the Religious Studies program ex-
panded; that too has been accom-
plished with the establishment of a
separate Religious studies Departr
ment.

Emou‘onai Hangups

Dissabsfactions with the Griunell
social and living environment, which
can best be lumpedtogetherasemo-
tional hangups, probably constitute
60% of the problems mentioned in
the returned surveys.

Members of the Grinnell com—
munity were by many of the depart—
ed Grinnellians characterized as
apathetic, nervous, homogeneous,
and simply ”mixed up.” Many,
many students indicated that they
were simply “tired ofschool” and
wanted to take a break.

One student noted that “The atti»
tude oi the campus (is) tired, in»
trospective." Another complained
that, “Grinnell is too unhappy and
mixed up iorme...’i‘hesocialatmos-
phere is really warped.”

The liberal environment was stif—
ling to one student who commented
that, “I felt the extreme liberalism
was for the most part oppressive
and an infringement on my person-
al rights, for example - opendorms,
the dope." Use of drugs by a large
segment of the student body was a
complaint voiced by a number of
other departing students.

Personal emotional problems of
one sort or another caused several
students to depart. one or two
mentioned a ﬁance or lover who
was at another school as their main
reason for leaving. Anothersaidthat
his relationship with his family was
deteriorating, and that he felt he
needed to return home for a time.

Counseuing

Another issue at Grinnell has been
the adequacy ofthe counsellingser-
vices. Most students indicated that
there was suiticient counselling
available for both academic and
emotional problems, but somecomr
plained about the quality oftheguid-
ance.

Opinion seemed to have beenequalr
ly divided both about where to go
for ccunsehing and how eitective
the counselling receivedis. One stu-
dent noted that, “1 found that the
RA-SA system was a joke" while
another who left Grinnell at about
the same timeindicated that, “Grin—
hell has been Very thorough in 59¢,
ting up counselling and assistance
systems,”

Almost all of those who responded
to the survey indicated thatacat‘lemr
ic counseuing, either through their
academic advisor, Mr.Obermiller’s
office, or the professor of a par
ticular course, was adequate.

Groups of friends formed whatwas
apparently the single most effective
counselling service for those stu~
dents who left Grinnell, Those who
indicated that they wereemouonally
and academicallywell»adjustedgave
all or part otthe credit to the help
of friends. Those who felt lost at
Grinnell usually indicated that they
either had no friends at all or at
most one or two with whom they
could talk freely.

Generally, the surveys indicated
that students were well aware of
what counseulng services were
available. In fact, one commented
that, “i think that the counselling
program as it is set up causes more
problems than it helpsl have often
heard it said that is seemed that a
student had to have problems in are
der to feel a part of the community.
1 think that once it has been made
clear that help is available, enough
has been said. One doesn’t need to
be constantly reminded that people
are anxiously Waiting to deal with
your vast problems."

Some other studentsseemedtohave
suffered from exceptionally unfor-
tunate livuig arrangements. One
commented that he “lived on afloor
that featured a couple, a pusher,
three hard drug users, and a human
sexual,” He addedthatthis naturally
made him begin to questionhis emOr
iional stability.

PPPE Discussion Upcoming

Dr, Robert Gorrell and Mr. Dick
McDonald, public relations exes
cutive and industrial consulting psy-
chologist, respectively, willpresent
a PPPE discussion on ”The Sells

rick Chapel on Sunday, November
19,at 2.00 pm.

McDonald, President of McDonald
Davis and Associates, has been ac—
tive in providing public relations,
for the Nixon campaign of 1968 and
1972 and developed and directed the
Nixon volunteer campaign in Wise
consin ior both campaigns. His pre»
sentation Will focus on the role of
3 public relations firm in politics.
“We are talking about helping men
bring before the electorate their
qualifications ior public office,”
he told the 3&5 in a recent inter-
view. ”That's whatthe democratic
process is all about” in McDon-
ald's assessment, today “more
thinking people are asking to have
the issues put before them,” and
effective use of communications
channels is key to presenting a cane
didate‘s message.

Helping people to focus on issues
is also central to Gorrell’s work.
“You have to deal ‘with issues, and
I thinking in this area most poli»
ticians begin to go astray," he said
recently in Gorrell's View you can-
not understand n system, be it cor-
porate or political, without taking

tively with people "

McDonald will focus during Sun-
day's presentation on the transition

irom campaigning to actual prac-
tice in office once elected, and Gore
