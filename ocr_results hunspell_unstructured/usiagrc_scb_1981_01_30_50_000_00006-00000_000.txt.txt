dent himself ls responsible for his hous-
ing and transportation. Most
previews last tor a week or two and
students generally stay with lamily or
friends depending on where they chose
to preview.

Schleifer maintains a file of some 300
possible sponsors but she stresses that
she is not limited to that alone She is
constantly expanding and updating this
file of alumni, lriends of students and
interested companies and plans to send
out another questionaire soon

Students reaction to the program has
been very lavorable. Eric Secny vistted
a Waukegan law ottice over winter
break and found his preview a "very
positive experience. ' The criminal
lawyer who showed him around was
"very helpful" and secoy went to Court
for tour days, observed plea bargain-
ing, client meetings and even prepared
a case ior one or the other partners.
