European nations realizing them-
selves to he dependent upon their
neighbors are unable to cooper-
ate. Mr. Crowther said.

The reasons may he grouped
thus, he continued: the first 307
mg hack to the World War when
military industries were over-ex-
panded and because of this, at
the end of the War demanded
protective tariffs; and second,
rising out of the pastewar settle-
ment of frontiers resulting in
the indiscriminate division of
single industries within them—
selves: third, the peasant move—
ment which made tariffs against
foreign goods inevitable because
of the rising belief in selfssuffl-
cienc ; and fourth, inflation
which resulted in industrial ex-
pansion with the resultant incur-
ring of debts to acquire tangible
property which would not ﬂuctu»
ate in value, and also threw pur—
chasing power into chaos leaving
the middle class, dependent upon
dividends, out in the cold,

do it alone?" he replied that hel
had come to the belief that it was
a one man job. "1 at first believed‘
that someone else was implicated,
but as the trial went on, and no]
new evidence to support this be;
lief was brought forward, 1 aban-
doned the idea," Mr. Kilg-allen
said.

"Hauptmann came into the
death chamber under his own
steam," the speaker stated in de-
scribing the final moments in the
story. “He was nervous and veryl
pale, but he did not talk nor show
any particular emtion," he ex-
plained. l
