Small Town Nostalgia

Grinnell:
An Appreciation

by Ed Hirsch

Anyone who has walked through Grinnell on
a Calm spring night will know \Vllzitl mean
when I speak about the quiet, dignified
beauty or the place. The wind is small,
stars can actually be seen in the sky, and
the trees int out irom the ground. it is
really no wonder that most seniors,
basically irom urban backgrounds, prepai»
ing to return to those or other urbanareas,
i‘eel a certain amount or nostalgia on leave
ing. Now I will admit that this is (lilti-
cult to either speak or wiite about Without
a sense oi personal inanlty and Without be:
ing labeled a romantic. Nostalgia, after
all, has been stolen by the mass media and
romanticism ls essentially a nineteenth cens
tury emotion, We leave the sentiment to
such misty eyed dreamers as Yeats, and go
on about our business.

The problem l suppose, or the iirst [rags
ment at a problem, is that even here, in
staid Grinnell, Iowa, urbanism is showing
its huge tenacles. Not inanytlling sodrastic
as a major highway going through the town
(alter all, we argue, Highway 80 is three
miles away‘ and it enables us to get here)
or so solid as a rising social conscious
ness, not even in anything so periectly typis
cal as our new Quick Chef, but rather in
the way in which the essentially urban colr
lege people go about their essentially urr
ban business. The sense that I have is
that I am talking about something like pace,
even rhythm, Even more so it is the so,
phistication oi urban boredom, oi the argue

lnCllt that really there isn'tanything to do
here, of Grinnell as It kind of cultural
wasteland. And if its true that the towns-
people and their iacilities otter very little
to the average college student, then maybe
it‘s that too; that in America day by day the
culture becomes more and more homogenes
ous, across the board the ideas of the
people, the cultural identity or the people
has become all too Similar. And maybe
ui‘banism is so rooted into our minds that
we actually do ieel dulled when separated
from the resources of the city,

During the first yearatGrinnell thesilence
both intrigued and repelled us Alter that
we adapted to it, we iorgot about it, we got
used to it, We simply moved the Suburbs
a law hundred miles iarther. And we began
to transtol'ln the college. Now I will admit
that Iowa too is going fast, that the last
remnants oi a cultural identity are quickly
being swallowed up by a kind or all encom—
passing American uniiormity, All at this
is interesting in so far as it has deceived
us. in tact the only way that we have really
related to the last remnats of a unique
midwestern culture is to mock it. For the
most part we’ve Completely ignored the
underlying folk tradition while at the same
time we have maximized and exploited the
political conservatism, According to our
own urban values, the people have shown
themselves to be behind. Behind whom?
Behind what?

I suppose that What all this is getting
around to is that someone should trickle over
to the Grinnell museum once in a while and
take a look at the pie-1900 descriptions of
the tornado. Or that next year they should
think about some day living again in aplace
that is liveable, or learn to depend on
'inner resouces’, not external entertain-
ments, And remember that here was a
place where the idea of night and the emo»
tion of fear are not inevitably linked.

I would conclude by arguing that all oi
this is not a way oi posturing romanticism.
Cynicism, atter all, is the real mark of a
Sentimentalist, the last refuge of a 1'0-
mantle.

The Farm And

Small Town
Grinnellian, A
Dying Breed

by Greg Vranicar

We lack a cohesive group identity; we do not
comprise a special organized interest group
on campus. We come to Grinnell irom all
parts oi the country, probably most oiten
irom lowa and the surrounding states oiir
numbers are dwindling, both in the nation
and at our alma mater, and nobody seems
to be able to do much about it. who are
we? We're young people irom iarms and
small towns, places oizo,ooo people or less,

in our tour years at Grinnell, we have
noticed lower and iewer students or our
background arriving ior New student Days,

Most oi us probably regret this iact. Feels
ing both seliishly and realistically that we
add to and beneiit irom the Grinnell com
munity in very proiound ways Those at us
who do iind out about Grinnell, apply ior
admission, and attend otten do very well.
both academically and in extra-curricular
activities, In my opinion, the trend toward
decreasing numbers oi Grinnellians irom
{arms and small towns is a great disap-
pointment.

There are several causes tor this trend,
Tuition and tees have risen about $650
since the class Dt'72 arrived, wiiile room
and board now comes to about $100 more
than it did our iii-st year. All students and
their parents now rind it more diiiicult to
iinance a Grinncll education despite the
quite generous {inancial aid program. In-
creases in the costs oi a Grlnllell edus
cation have cut out cert 'n segments oi
the prospective student market. One oi the
groups now looking elsewhere seems to be
those qualitied iarm and slllétllslowil high
school graduates who think they can do inst
as well academically at another school ior
considerably less money.

a second lactor in the declining iai-m and
small-town population at ci-inncii is the
admissions process itseli it is very dil-
iicult and ineiiicient ioi- Grinnell‘s atllnis»
sions staii to recruit in small high schools
where the likelihood oi even seeing an lllr
terested candidate is much lower than in
larger schools usually bound in and around
a city. The increased demand and need toi-
larger numbers oi minority group stu~

dents at Grinnell likewise works against
the ability at the admissions staff to reg
orbit in areas where farm and Small-
town students go to high school,

In addition, Grinnell’s academic and Social
image tends to scare away some very quali-
iied prospective students. High school stu-
dents in lows and surrounding states who
have even heard of Grinnell have Often
been told that it is a very high-powered
academic institution, one at which they will
have to work very hard for a degree, This
“ore-selects" some of these students away
irom looking at Grinnell, even though they
would be very able to handle the load and
probably would enjoy it. The social image
of Grinnell, the idea that Grinnell is a
“freak” school, also sometimes works
against students irom iarms and small towns
attending the school This has been distorted
and blown out of proportion by unusual in-
cidents like the Playboy disrobing and the
early closing in the spring oi 1970. it is
possible that the problem has diminished
since Grinnell has emoyed almost two years
of relative quiet on the “spectacular news"
section of the wirerservices,

Finally, the national trend in population iS
toward the cities and suburbs and this trend
is reﬂected at Grinnell, There are simply
iewer iarm and small town young people
irom which to choose today than iour years
ago, Unless ruraland small town redevelops
mellt is undertaken as a concerted national
policy, this trend will continue

Why should we tie concerned about the de-
cline in the number of (arm and smalletown
Gi‘innellizins'.’ First, because this type of
student Otters a great deal to the community,
especially in providing a unique perspective
on the world iind its problems and liiusually
adding a iolksy, unpretentious personality
to the student body. (One or the things that
bothered me most in nly first weeks at
Grinnell was that many people didn’t greet
one another when meeting on campus"
something I always liked in my home town.
whose population was about the same as that
ol Grinnell College.) Secondly, we should be
concerned because Students from farms and
small towns beneﬁt a great deal from
Gi-innell and olten really emoy their ex-
perience here, These students have an opr
portuniiy to come in contact with people
whose backgrounds are in several basic
ways very different irom their ownand from
whom they Chit learn a good deal. Finally,
we should be concerned with this trend
because It means that Grinnell is not
serving, as well as it once did, the hall
of the population in Iowa and surrounding
states that lives on iarms and in small
towns. ll Gi‘lllllell is really committed to
serving and being comprised oi a broad
and diverse group oi people, it would do
well to make fin extra eitort to reverse
the tiend toward fewer (arm and small»
town students.
