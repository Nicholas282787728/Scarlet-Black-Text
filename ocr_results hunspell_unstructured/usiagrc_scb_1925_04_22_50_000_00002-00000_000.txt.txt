Book of The
Week

The idle and Death
Claude Fer-val:

of Cleopatra.
Doubleday & Page.
g It must he a gigantic undertaking
for an author who lives in the age
modernity, to make live again, the
characters who played the great parts
in Roman History, it must he a task
that calls for a wonderful sense of
adaptability. One lecls, upon reading
some of the llew biographies that the
College Lihxary has lately secured,
such at Ariel," the “Life of Shelley."
“Marie Antoinette,” and "The Life and
Death of Cleopatra,” that the authors
of these books have done well indeed
to place their characters in a panto-
mine which cannot be forgotten.

Ferrel, in his new book, has made
that wonderful creature, Cleopatra,
live again. Live in a way that she has
never been pictured to live. in many
places, though it may be due to the
translation, the book takes on the at-
titude of dullness. There are, newer.
er, a sufficient number of beautifully
told places to make the book a great
book. who was Cleopatra? We may
well ask that question, as well as,
What was she like? Ferval makes her
live as a beautiful character and says
that she was a woman who was made
up of a combination of pride and {rails
ty. A woman who was either loved or
despised. And still, after living under-
these two incongruous atmospheres,
turned out to be a personage who will
never be forgotten and, in a sense of
the uerd, never be forgiven.

Histoly distorts the character of
Cleopatra, portraying her in her one
mood; s rig that she u as a grasping,
sell-centered woman whose only
thoughts were to secure for herself as
many kingdoms as there were on the
earth. Saying also that she was a dip»

louiatic woman, and that sends onc-

ofi on a tangent which leads one to
believe she was a modern suffragettc,
a woman who would trade a ngdoui
for a lover's kiss. Ferral shows, that
along with her avarice, Cleopatra
could be as kind and considerate as
any woman. Cleopatra even attained
the air of' frivolity at times.

( 1n the first chapters of the hook,
Cleopatra is pictured as a slip of a
girl; seventeen years old. She has just
begun to realize that, with the aid of
Caesar she can make her dreams, riot
dreams, but realities, But, instead of
going to Caesar iii a r val fashion as
she was entitled to go, she had her
scrvant. Apollodol’us, rap her in an
oriental rug and smuggle her into the
walled town of Rome. After her one
trance into the real castle, she finds
her path comparatively easy. Caesar,
sorriewhat abashed by the attention
paid him by this small girl, falls, un-
consciously of course, into her plans.
thereby hr giiig disgrace upon him-
self and glory upon Cleopatra.

After her affair with Caesar, Clear
pati-a, upon his death, finds in Antony
all the requirements of a model lover
iAntony uas last becoming the leading
figure in the Roman Empire and Cleo—

p-atra, seeing this, favors him with liei
affection, nthouy, being almost hue
man, finds it easy to rail in love with
this charming woman and so the two
having mutual confidences to e
char find it not iiiihard to rail i-e
much in love with each other.

) Cleopatra brought Antony immortal—
ity, hrit along with immortality came
death to both of them.

ental picture framed in blue and po
