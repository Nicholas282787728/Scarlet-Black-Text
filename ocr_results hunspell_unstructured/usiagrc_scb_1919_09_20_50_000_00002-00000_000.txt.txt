Tull NEW DORMITORY SYSTEM
This year will see a change in the

system at the Men's Dormitory—a
change which we believe wiiLbe for
the better. The faculty men who are
going'to make their homes with us,
come to join in the 'holesume fellow—
ship that the Dormitory affords. They
are not policemen, but are "in for a

‘good tirnc" as much as any of us.
As President Main said the other

morning, "We are here primarily to
Study," and since we live at the Dorms
the Dorms should primarily be a place
of work and study. But still the
social and relim'ous sides of this life
cannot be ignored. Men will get to-
gether for good times and if these
good times are of the right kind, a
great deal of good may come from
these associations. It is up to each
man to develop his manhoodand per—
sonal life so that it will serve him
best in after life.

Grinnell aims to produce different
men, men who have a different spir-
it_of helpfulness and co-operation and
it is toward this end that we are
all working. M. Griffith and Mr.
Compton, the new men in charge of
the Dorms, are working toward this
ideal, and they need and want the
support and eo-opcration of every
man, not only in the Dormitories, but
in the whole school.

This is a new system and its success
is in the hands of every one of us.
Give it a trial and a square deal and
every one will he satisﬁed.

__G‘
THE TEAM

Grinnell is about to enter upon the
most promising football season she
has experienced for many years.
Football stars of two, three and four
years ago are returning to school,
who together with the squad from
last year, will provide a wealth of
material for Coach Tollefsnn to work
with. The older students remember
that Tellefson was the man who pros
duced Grinnell's 'beampionS of Iowa"
team two years ago, and no one can
predict what he‘is liable to do with
this experienced material to work
with.

With these facts it ought not be
necessary tD urge anyone {0 Support
the team for each of us ought to look
with longing eyes toward the ﬁrst
clash on the gridiron. Support the
team. They deserve it and will ap—
preciate it.

AN APPRECIATION.

Among those to whom Grinnell is
indebted tor generous gifts which have
greatly aflected its life and prosperity
is the late Andrew Carnegie. His
gift of the college library building in
1904 was the beginning of the develops
merit of the college's external equips
nrent, which has been carried on for
the past ﬁfteen years. The amount
of this endowment was ﬁfty thousand
dollars, and required a corresponding
support fund.

Mr. Carnegie again came to the aid
of the college when in 190s it was
working for its half-million endows
mont. His gift of ﬁfty thousand, the
largest made by any one individual,
encouraged the workers to new effort
as well as materially swelling the
fund.

"The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching," is shared
by all the colleges of the country. It
provides allowances for retiring
teachers, with the purpose of removV
ing the necessity for dependence in
old age. Two Grinnell men, Profess»
ors Macy and Buck, have already had
the beneﬁt of this allowance. .

In tribute to Mr. Carnegie. Professor
Noble says that though we may de»
plore an economic condition which
makes possible the amassing or such
great wealth, we cannot but recognize
the sincere desire of Andrew Carnegie
to use his money for the highest in—
terest of humanity, and be grateful
for the great services which he has
rendered to his generation. ‘

YOUR PLAN

“What ya been doin' this summer?”
was the ﬁrst question your friends
asked you. "What are you going to
do?" is the ﬁrst question your profess-
ors asked. “DO you know?” is the
question we want to ask you. It is of
utmost importance that every man
and woman in Grinnell know ”what
he or she is going to do" because
without a plan of some kind your col-
lege course will be wasted. Have a
purpose in coming to college, see that
this purpose is carried out and your-
college course will never cease to be
profitable from either a practical or
a cultural standpoi

WILL YOU?
Co—operation is the keynote to all
success. This measure of success
may be the building of an' efficient
business, the producing of a chants
pionsbip football team or the carry—
ing thru or a proﬁtable college yea

 

At present we are all concerned
with making this year the best year
that Grillnell has ever had, in all rose
pects. We are looking forward to a
big year in every sense of the word.
You can do‘ your part it you will.

We have Just heard of an enter»
