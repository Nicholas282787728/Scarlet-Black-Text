Pioneer Tank
Team to Seek
Valley Crown

Seven Grinnell Swimmers

Leave for Conference
Meet Today

Seven Pioneer swimmers left for St.
Louis today to compete in the lvtissouri
Valley conference meat at Washington
university. Friday and Saturday.

Grinnell will enter two former con.
forence champions. Dave Malbrough,
present holder of the l50.yard back.
stroke and 220.yard free style crowns.
Clark Elbert, a former titleholder, is
returning after an absence of one
year.

Washington Main Threat

Victorious in only two duel contests
this season, the Pioneers should make
a more impressive showing in the
valley meet. Advance infonnation, ac.
cording to John Trigg, swimming man.
ager, indicates that Washington uni.
versity offers the main threat. to Grin-
nell championship hopes.

Washburn, already beaten by the
Pioneers, should prove an aid rather
than a threat, for their strength is
our weakness, and will not detract
from our score, Trigg stated. Results
of Oklahoma A. At M. swimming meets
reveal no opposition from that quarter.
Tulsa university the fifth entrant, re.
mains the dark horse and may upset
the results.

will Rely on Veterans

Grinnell will rely mainly upon its
two veterans. Malbrough and Elbert,
for the bulk of its points. Malbrough
should repeat his victory in the back.
stroke, but will have a battle to win
over Varney, Washington flash, in the
220.yard swim. Elbert appears to be
certain of two victories, the breastroke
and 44o.yard free style.

Holch in the sprints, Parzybok div.
ing, and Peterson in the distance
events are other individuals who
should raise the team score. Holch
will be facing the fastest field he has
met this season, but the longer pool
may prove to his liking. Parzybok
looms as a possible winner, due to his
diving victory in the Washington duel
meet here.

Five Schools Entered

The Valley meet this year will he
a real championship affair. Flvc
schools will be represented; Grinnell.
Washington, Washhur-n, Oklahoma A.
or M., and Tulsa. Drake and Creigh.
ton are not entering teams this year
Preliminaries will be held in all i .
dividual events Friday night, with the
finals and relays Saturday night.
eElght men will make the trip, seven
swinuners and John Trigg, student
manager. Pioneer entries are: Dave
Malbrough, Clark Elbert, Sam Holch,
lles Peterson, Frank Mchthy, Bill
Parzybok, and Charles Whitmore.

Swimmers Chalk Up

The Grinnell swimmers chalked up
their second win of the season here
Saturday by outclassing Washburn 53
31. The Pioneers scored six first
places out of the nine events.

Captain Dave Malbrough and Clark
Elbert, both seniors, made their final
appearance in the Grinnell pool by
