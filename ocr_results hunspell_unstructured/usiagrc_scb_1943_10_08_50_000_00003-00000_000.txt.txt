reers and begining' their Navy

Iowa who are‘ at Newberry. The
seventh, despite lack of previous
drilling experience, quickly has
become the trickiest drilling pla—
toon at Newberiy.

Platoon leaders are changed at
regular intervals, and or the tirst
three leaders or seven two have
bees Grinnellians.

Dick Greening

er of seven, and Ed Krause, a
senior, is serving as platoon lead-

Posf-War Seminar Discusses
Race Problem In Firs+ Meefing

“What do you mean when you say ‘negro’7” Do you mean

a Detroit factory worker? Do

you mean all Alabama Share-

cropper‘l Dou you mean Marian Anderson? Do you mean a
negro that was lynched by a mob? Do you mean a young
woman who is getting her PhD”? Do you mean a female
fann hand? Who do you mean when you say negro?”

This was the problem stated
by John Burma, chairman of the
sociology department, to students
in the post-war seminar, which
met Tuesday evening, October 5,
in Haines ’ lor. to discuss the
race probl ‘ in the United
States. %

As race' ‘an artificial distinc»
tion. we must approach .the nee
gro as an individual, Mr. Burma
pointed out. In this way. the ne-
gro can be helped to reach his
goals or economic, political, and
social equality.

Following Mr. Burma’s intro-
diictlon to the problem, seminar
members had a chance to ask
questions. When asked by Vii-a
ginia Foote, James junior, if in-
telligence test scores increased
when environment changed, Mr.
'Burma replied that later we

would ﬁnd no perceptive dlfter— _

ence.

When the problem of negro,

employment was brought in to the
conversation, Dr. Earl Strong,
adviser to the post»war seminar,
pointed out that white unions ac-
cepted negroes so that

own unions which would coin-
pete with the white ones,

The next meeting of the sem-
inar, Tuesday, October 12, at
7:30 p. m. in Homes parlor, will
he devoted to a discussion of
the Japanese American problem,
with Barbara Tekabashi, Virginia
Jennings, and Joann Jordan dISr
cussing the various phases, ac
cording to Fatricia Milnor, chair
man of the seminar.
