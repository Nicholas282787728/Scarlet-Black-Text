But tilsl'r
es or not. there are milny good reasons that we see so many Grin-
nellinns rake seriously the opportunity to enter into a period of
voluntary service ntrer graduationWliether it is through the Peace
Corps, Teach For America, Griiinell Corps, Americorps, Avodah,
Lutheran Volunteer Corps or a host ororhey programs, Griniiell
students commit to voluntary service in numbers far higher than
graduates from most other schools around the country. Nationally,
we see about 0.5% of college graduates enter voluntary service
proginms directly atrer gradunrion; at Grinnell, 12r150/n of each
graduating class does so, and I would estimate that a total of20%
otcrinnellians carry out a term ofvoliintary service at some point
in their lives,

Graduating from college launches you into what is arguably
the treesr period oryour life You probably have a couple of boxes
or clothes and hooks (which can go in someone’s attic), perhaps
some loans (which can be deferred) and maybe a used car (which
can be sold). You will he shocked by how quickly this freedom you
now enjoy Will disappeariﬁve years from now, it's likely that your
life will be completely different, and entering a voluntary service
program will be next to impossihle, thanks to a mortgage, a partner
or even a pet or child. In other words,your window ofoppurmnlry
to do something extraordinary is relatively short.

Entering a voluntary service program will also help you prepare
for the rest ofyour Life, whatever that may look like and whatever

service,but thatyou will hcabetter, more interesting applicant, that
you'll see things drtierenrly than your peers do and thnr you'll be
a better graduate student or employee because otthis experience.

Voluntary service programs are also a terriﬁc way to act on your
values. one otthe recurring themes at Grinnell's commencement
each year is a charge to the graduates
that they have been given much in their
education, and that they therefore have
an obligation to give back to the world.
Byentcring n voluntary service program,
you are doing exactly rlinteusing the
skills, talents, and abilities that you have
nurtured at Grinnell to help improve the
lives of others, either
in the US or in other '
countries

These are all good
reasons to consider
entering a voluntary
servrce program, but
they are all relatively
inward-looking, telling you what you’ll personally
gain by raking on such an opportule I hope
you’ll consider external reasons for such a com-
mitment, roo,hecause you're needed. Desperately
needed. Peace Corps is only ﬁlling about one-
tliitd to onerhalfofits positions in Francophone
Africa these days. Hundreds orAinerieorps posie
tions go unmatched every year, Ourworld needs

And it’s notjusr ahoutputting warm bodies in

a Peace Corps recruiter once told me: “I 10%:

is twice the national average, and that out Peace Corps volunteers

Your experience at Grinnell has prepared you exceptionally well to
take on these challenges, and in so doing. create positive change
in the world.

lhat's not so say that voluntary service is the right choice for
everyonel‘here are some students whose goals, aspirations or vale
ues may not include voluntary service. Others may face economic
realities that make immediate. paid employment a necessity. Many
students beneﬁt society by seeking our paid worlc such as teaching,
that accomplishes the same goals that voluntary service does.’l‘hese
are all legitimate and valid reasons not to take on voluntary service;
as not a cureenll, and nothing can be a complete match for every
member ofa student body as diverse as Grinnell's. .

But in 11 years ofworking wrth Grinncll smdenls,I have yet
to help an alum enter a voluntary service program and then have
that person come back and tell me that they regretted it.That they
regretted moving to a new community, learning a new language or
