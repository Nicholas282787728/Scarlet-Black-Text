PALM SUNDAY IS
PRAYERS TOPIC

Marion Read Explains Present
Meaning of Palm Sunday.

“Few oi us realize the real siguiii.
cance at Palm Sunday—What it means
and has'muant," snid Marian Read in
a talk at Prayers Sunday morning,

The palm she said, was the symbol

groac obstacles. Using a psaim‘ or
bay-id and one of Van Dyke's poems,
“A Hymn of Jay", sho illustrated the
‘dlttcronco in the old and now concep-
tions at praise. l

The cycle of Passion Week. from
great joy through great sorrow to
abiding peace is typical of the spiri-
tuial life ot most people today. In
youth, we have an enthusiastic faith
in the goodness or God which, when
we begin real intellectual research, is
apt to weaken until seine great expor-
lance brings to “S G. lasting bBliBf.

"ll‘iost of us now,” concluded Miss
Read, "are experiencing those doubts
oi the foundations of our faith. But
maturity will put matters in the right
perspective and we shall find a great
Sims faith in and again."

Preceding Miss Road's talk, Miss
Elizabeth Stevens, accompanied by
Mr, Laurel Andersen, sang an aria
from Massenet’s “Mary Magdalen."
