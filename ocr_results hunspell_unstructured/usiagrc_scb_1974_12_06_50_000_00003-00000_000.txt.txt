Krivchenia: promotes Saga fast

Dear Edito :

I would the to encourage
students to sign up for the Saga last
this Dec, 18. For students who sign
away their meals, Saga wills us 72
cents. All money received will go to
UNICEF‘S West African
Emergency Relief Fund.

Many students have doubts
about the value oi sending money
to organizations like UNICEF. The
reasons we (Third World Study
Group, Grinnell Christian
Fellowship, and Crazy House)
choose are 1) the money is ad
ministered by an international
organization, and 2) UNICEF is a
nondenominational. We also ielt
land still do feel) that UNICEF
was a reputable organization,

worthy oi receiving our iunds.
However, 1 would like to say that
the money received is only a part
oi the purpose tor the fast. it is our
hope that the tast will also make
people more aware oi die real

problem the world is lacing: many
people are starving, and many,
many more are malnourished, To
achieve this end, there will be an
alternative dinner the day oi the
last in Gardner Lounge at5:30. The
meal will be a nominal one, rice
and water, The dinner’s main

purpose is to inform people of the
problem and to discuss it. A
speaker, Mr. Max Gumm, will give
a presentation on the immediate
and long-range implications of the
world food situation. Mr. Gumm, a
representative of CROP (Church
Rural Overseas Program), also
wants to discuss what the world
food situation means for
Americans—us. A quote irom
Ghandhi expresses Something of

what I feel about this issue:
“God never creates more than
what is strictly needed for the
moment, with the result that if
anyone appropriates more than he
really needs, he reduces his neigh-

bor t0 destitution.” 7

The Grinnell Scarlet and Black, Friday, Dec. 6,1974—na2e 3

5‘ Iowa in focus l

by John M. Wylie II
News Director. KDlCrFM

The controversy over what kinds
of books should be on school library
shelves, which has led to violence
in West Virginia and loud protests
in many other states, has come to
Grinnell,

By a unanimous vote, members
of the Grinnell-Newburg Come
munity School District Board of
Education Nov. 26 acted to remove
three bestselling novels irom
district library shelves following a
complaint lrom a parent that the
books are “obscene and vulgar.”

Ben See, 37, a Grinnell
businessman and a lay preacher
for the Church of Christ, asked that
The Godfather, The Exorcist and
The Slimmer 0! ‘42 be removed
from the high school library while
a committee studies their literary
and educational merit.

See wants more than just those
three books removed, “We have
many books in the library which
are obscene by most religious
standards,” he said.

In a petition signed by 77 other G-
N district parents, See asked for
“The removal from our school
libraries of any and all (materials)
which describe, explain, or elude
(sict to sexual intercourse of or
between humans,”

Since the petition was presented.
wags have been pointing out that
See's delinition oi obscenity ap-
parently would bar copies oi the
Bible, most novels, many text
books and, in fact, almost every
book and magazine now in print.

In removing the books-irom the

library shelves pending a hearing.
the school board was using a

standard procedure adopted
almost two years ago but never
belore put into practice

A committee is now being toi»
med to study the books, Their
report will be forwarded to the
Board for final action.

There appears to be some board
support for removing at least some
allegedly abscene or vulgar books
lrorn the school system.

Kenneth Keenan, a board
member told the meeting, “As a
parent I wouldn't want my kids to
read those things,”

For now, there are three books at
issue. But See made it Clear that he
wants every book in the district
libraries examined.

A possible side effect of the
Board’s action may be felt next
Tuesday when district voters go to
the polls to decide the fate of a $449
million bond issue

See said his decision to raise the
issue of the books at this time had
nothing to do with the spirited
campaign over the bonds.

“The best time to stop Something
like this (“obscene” books) is in
the beginning,” he explained.
“You have to nip it in the bud."

That bond issue has aroused
Strong opposition among some
conservative residents who belive
the 10 per cent raise in taxes would
not be justiﬁed by the benefits to be
derived from the district building
program,

Some observers believe that the
board‘s action may alienate other
voters who would otherwise sup-
port the bond issue,

Although See said he had nothing
to do with the organized opposition
to the bonds, he gave this reporter
a telephone number to call “where
you can get a good story.”

The number belonged to one oi
the opposition groups, and the
story involved the bond issue,

See believes his effort have the
support ol a majority oi the G-N
parents. So tar, reaction has
been muted, Most district
residents appear to be taking a
”wait and see" attitude pending
the outcome of the board come
mittee study.

BITS AND Placasidim Davis,
host oi the popular it ”Davis and
Monico in the Morning” program
on Des Moines Radio Station
KIOA, has had his day in court
postponed until next year.

Davis, accused or attempting to
hire a state agent to muder his
yvite, Tuesday had his trial post-
poned until alter Jan. 1. The trail
had been scheduled to begin

Court,
