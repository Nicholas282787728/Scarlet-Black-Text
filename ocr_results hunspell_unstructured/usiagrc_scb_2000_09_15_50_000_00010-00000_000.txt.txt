‘Chic’ intolerance

Dear Editor,

we are wriring this lerrer in response re rhe eoliimn enrirled

to be perenrly offensive to both cerholics end iron—carholies

Diversiryseems ro be an issue rher ciirinellians held near
and dear; however, when rher diversiry eneompesses groups or
beliefs rhar tell ourside rhe rredirionel liberel canon, ii is rner
with disdein. While it is terrainly “Grinnell chic" ro eririeree

Perhaps Grinnellians
ought to reevaluate
the reality of the ,
situation on campus
and decide if they are
as tolerant as they
would like to believe
themselves to be.

Stand up for workers’ rights

Dear Ediror,

rectory may be cleen, well-organized. and monitored, bur unless
rhe workers are paid a susrainable living wege, it is still a

Emotional dism

I'm all for the power or the Internet, but when
people start abusing that power, I have a strong desire
to introduce them to the business end or my ethernet
card.

The abuse to which 1 refer is the ﬂood of mass
email that has been delugi‘ng my inbox of late. I’m not
particularly upset with the content or these messages,
but rather the psychological damage they have been
doing to me.

When my computer makes that oh-sd-special-you've-
gotsmail ping, i rush to open my email client to see
which‘of my veryspecr'al (read, three) friends has been
kind enough to email me. Imagine my horror when I
ﬁnd that my new messages are nothing but cold,
unfeeling spam.

In the name of my already fragile psyche. please.
no more mass emails.

Toward a New Cuneiform

Living in a community without traceable cultural
history, such as a small undergraduate college, is
unique, exhilarating, and bewildering. Unwritten
mantras are doomed to mutation or demise.

That’s why I’m making the call, here and now, to
institute a written code of laws. And in even start
the ball rolling with a row of my own.

Don’t discuss your SAT scores.

Study in groups.

Make eye contact vn'th people who want you to
sign a petition.

And if you happen to be a Republican, never let
anybody know.

Ha ha! Just kidding on that last one, of Course We
certainly have never had incidences of people being
publicly jeered at merely tor expressing their political
beliefs to the campus.

Computer ﬁllstration

What‘s the deal with computers at this school? In all
of one month, I have experienced lost ﬁles, disks that
went into the computer and never came out again,
frozen screens, and most of alL the printers.

on the printers. Why do they hate me so much? i
never did anything bad to them. After ﬁnishing my ﬁrst
paper in the Norris computer lab, I clicked on print and
waited. I ﬁrst noticed a problem when I saw that there is
no printer in the Morris computer lab. okay. 1thought rll
just waLk over to Cowles andgget my paper. But there was
a problem. Cowles computer Lab was locked, and my
paper was lost Mine is only one computer sob story in a
sea of many, which is why Robert Noyce would not be a
happy camper if he were here today.
