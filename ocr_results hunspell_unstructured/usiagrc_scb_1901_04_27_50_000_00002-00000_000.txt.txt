Garlic question still haunts the

minds ofsomeof those stu-
dents most interested in Intercolr
legiate Debating, why has Grinnell
lost during live successive year-s.
One grows weary in trumping up
the old answer—that our team
coped with a stronger team, and
there met its Waterloo. Tire
steady repetition of that sort of
thing stamps the Grinnell intellect
as interior among sister institu-
tions of the state; and such an acr
knowledgeme‘nt the students of
Iowa College will not make with»
outa struggle of some years to
come. Butsomewherethereason
lies just as surely as can be. and
the consensus or opinion seems to
hinge around that old point of
view, which has been presented
again and againiinsut‘ﬁcient free-
dom from class room work is al-
lowed the debaters during the
time ot preparation The amount
ot work and the length of time res
quired to get a debate into shape
is actually appalling, and those
who have never experienced this
task have really little conception
of the demands put upon the de-
baters. When, in addition to this,
the regular work is required to be
kept in hand, it is truly a wonder
that any debating is done in the
institution. Other colleges do
not follow this plan. The lea way
given to Cornell debaters, for ex-
ample, is well known, and so is
their eminent success on the plat
form, ThetacultyotlowaCollcge
doubtless grow weary of hearing
about this subject and of reading
criticisms on themselves in these
columns. The words written here
are only a iriendly expression ot
studentthought, and the solution
offered by students themselves is
asked to he accepted as such.

 

help and encouragement, the at
titude of the faculty, as a whole,
is too severe. Too much is re-
quired. It credit were given tor
work done. having an intercol-
legiate debate in View, the de»
hater could take less college
work and prrt more time and
strength on his preparation, The
maximum time put on both would
not then probably exceed the
work carried by the average stur
dent; furthermore both class room
work and debating preparation
would be the gainers. The im-
mediate answer ot the faculty
might be that Grinnell has always
aimed at a high standard of
scholarship and to open such an
avenue for acquiring credit would
merely pave the way tora gradual
and even imperceptible dropping
of the standard: that isto say one
invasion upon these grounds
would be followed by another.
The truth of this statement is
fully admitted and were it not for
an cqrrally true fact, no such plea
as this would be framed in these
columns. The fact is thisiand
the correctness of it is left to
every member of the facultyitllat
more thorough and lasting know-

ledge along certain lines, more
systematic training otthougltt and
logic. more of the results in fact

ed ftom intercollegiate debating
than from a three or sometimes
even ﬁve hour course along the
lines reterred to. By grving
credit for such work as this, the
student opinion gives no place to
the tear of lowering the college
standard. The students think
credit will encourage debating
and in no wayimpair high grade

students are wrong. They would

through tlrcsecolumrrs might allay
student uneasiness about these
matters. These columnsareopen
