ON NEXT Friday evening our
debating team will try to re-
deem our record of three success-
ive defeats at the hands of Cor-
nell, We wish to assure them
that they carry with themiwheth-
er they win or loseithe good will
or every student ot Iowa College.
Not only is our team one of the
best which we have ever sent out.
but it has walked in a way in
which none of out teams of other
years ever thought of doing. No
effort has been spared on their
part to bring back the victory
when they return. We wish to
urge again upon the students that
it isthe duty at each and every
one who is in any way able to go
to Mount Vernon and encourage
our debaters, No matter what
the result may be, they ought to
feel, and deserve to feel that the
whole college is back of them,
Every possible tacrlity tor trans-
portation has been arranged by
the oPﬁcials of thedebating league.
Provided one hundred persons
signify their intention of going.
the Northwestern railroad will
run a special train, leaving Grins
nell at 8:40 Friday morning, and
returning the same night. In case.
any wish to stay longer, it has
been arranged that the tickets
shall be good over Saturday. All
this is conditional upon the pro-
curing of one hundred students
to go. We hope that as many as
possibly can will take advantage
of this opportunity, both to visit
a sister institution and to support
ateam which ought to have as
much and as enthusiastic support
as we can give it. The support
which Cornell gave her debaters
last year should be an incentive
to us to do as well. In past years
our debating teams have gone
away with one lone substitute to
cheer them on. We hope that
this disgraceful state of affairs has
passed forever, and that our dele-
gation, a hundred strong, may be
present at Mount Vernon on Frir
day night to cheer our representa»
tives, whether in victory or defeat.

Freshmeanophomore Meet.

The annual Freshmeanopho-
more Field Meet was held last
Saturday before a grand stand
ﬁlled with enthusiastic spectators.
The rivalry existing between the
two classes created unusllal inter
est in the meet, which was one of
the closests and hardest fought
contests ever seen in Grinnell. as
is proven by the ﬁnal score of

man ﬁnished Close together in all
the sprints, and Evans ran a re-
markable mile for a man who had
not trained for that event. The
time made in the sprints and
hurdles was good, taking into con-
sideration the condition of the
track, which was very slow. The
bicycle events will be decided at
the Home Meet next Saturday,
and the ﬁnal result of the meet
cannot be deﬁnitely known until
