calls him a "highly regarded Latin

descriptions are correct, but not any»

that more appropriate terms might be

commented about this

weekend's cultural ﬁlm, The
Idiot, “I had wanted to make this

was llttle I’ve liked Russian litera
ture, and have read the greater part
ofit.butIl‘indthatl like Dostoevsky
the best and he is the one who
writes most honestly about human
existence."

In Dostoevsky Kurosawa found
an author whose fortns and Sensiblllr
ties, and the historical dislocations to
which they responded, were analo-
gous to his own.

Thishlniingoftlietalcoftheholy

Tiansposing this Russian saga
of madness and Jealousy to post war

SCARLET&BLACK - Friday, March 3, 1995 0 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 7

Bobby Sanabria a vivid, interesting scholar

not dry and academic, but informal
and vivid. t-lc frequently interrupts
his lecture to demonstrate on the trap
sct, congas, bongos, or timbales.

Sanabria, who grew up in the
New York Puerto Rican community,
is here as part of the wcck—long
GrinncllCollegePercussion Sympo-
sium. He leads his own ensemble.
Ad‘cetlo‘ion, and has played with the
late Mart'DBauzu'r AfrorCubaItlazz
Orchestra. He has also been pub
lishedinModemDrtmlmer, New York
biting, and Dercarga.

Sanabrio is a fountain ofknowl»
edge on the fascinating history of
Lntlnior, as he refers to it, Afton
Cubanimusic. The music, an amalr
gam ochst- and North-African pcrr
cussion and vocal melody and Span-
ish- and other Europeanderived
music, was all originally shaken to
gether and improved on by African
slaves in Spanish Cuba. Sanabria
explains this music as the sort of
center of a wide swath of inﬂuence
on all contemporary American mu»
siciincludingjazz in all its incarnar

tions, rock, R & B and now funk and
hipliop. Asapcrcussiontst,Sanabrla's
take on the music consists of tracing
the spread of beats, all of which are
centered on the clave. The Claw: ins
spired original Cuban music, called
ro’rt, which spread through New Orr
leans and, eventually, to the break-
through of mambo in the New York
dance scene of the 30’s.

The last chance to see Bobby will
be at this afternoon's Panel Discussion
on “Careers in Music" at 2:00 pm. in
thc Ham's Center Theatre.

HOUGH Tracy Chapman is
I more anticipated on campus
than tonight’s concert by
Poncho Sanchez, his performance
should not be underestimated.
Sanchez’s music IS a
danceable mix of Latinizetl jazz slan-
dards,salsaand ballads. Hislivcshow
promises to be very lively and dance-
orlcnlcd, driven by Sancliez‘s infecn
Llous AfrOVCuban congarplaying,
Thc9:00 p.m. Ham's showshould
make a ﬁtting climax for this week's
Percussion Symposium. Sanchez is
knownas“e!magnetosuprenio”(“uie

THU WEEK AT THE MOVIE HOUJ'E
By ELEANOR DODSON so TAYLOR WYMAN

Staff Movie Reviewers
Eleanor’s View

ULP Fiction exploded lnto
Plast year by Winning the

Palms d’Or at the Cannes
Film Festival. Several months later,
keenly anticipated by critics and our
dicnccs alike, Pulp Fiction opened
nationwide. Finally, nearly a year
aftcrlhc Canncs,ilrcachcs Grinncll.
Hailed as one of the best films of
[994, Pulp Fiction has been re-
wat'ded with seven Academy Award
nominations.

What sets Pulp Fiction apart
from licarly cvci y other film released
in the past few years, even the good
ones, is the brilliance of its script.
QuentinTarantino and Roget Avary
have strung together a series ofsto-
ties about the underbelly of pop culr
lure. Tarantino has attracted a lot of
attention for his skill as a director,
but it is his writing that gives the
film its frantic energy, especially in
his dialogue. The script is brought
to justice by an amazing cast, in
particular the righteous power of

Samuel L. Jackson and an outrun
geouscameobyChristopherWalken.

Pulp Fiction manages to be
both raw and stylized at once. Big-
ger and faster than Tarantino’s den
but rilin, Rercivcir Dogs, Pulp Fic-
tt‘aii is a celebration of the exciton
merit of movies. Tarantlno is not
afraid to challenge his audience,
pushing them to thc cxtreme limits
oftlieirtolerances. Some accept this
Joyously and are taken torthe ride of
a lifetime, while those who cannot
end up out in the cold.

Taylor’s View

VERYONE that I have ever
talked to has seen Pulp Fire

tiori. If you have somehow

slipped through the cracks up till
now or ifyou want to see it again
you will have your chance all
this week.

This ﬁlm deserves all the
praise and the best picture nominar
tion it has received. Quentin
Tarantino does a superb job of die
reeling, his best film to date (we
have so many to choose from), the
acting is strong throughout the film,
and script is so unique and humor
ous that it keeps you shocked and
laughing the entire time. The world
portrayed in this film is one of the
darkestinrccclitmcmory:ﬁlled with
murder, rape, sadism, you name it,
but the characters react to this dark
violence with such unexpected
nonchalance that you can‘t help
but laugh at the film even while
the character remove glob: of
brains from mcir hair. This ﬁlm is deﬁ-
nitely an experience that is worth the
money. Bottom line: 1tyou want an-
otheropinionaskthe guynexttoyou;
he hassecnittoo.

Clear and PnSelll Danger

This is the latest Tom Clancy book
tumed movte. Harrison Ford mums
as CIA agent Jack Ryan in this ﬁlm
aboutillegalmilitaryopeiationsagainst
drug lords in Columbia. We enjoyed
watching laser guided bombs dropped
down drug dealers’ shorts, but at the
same time. the illegality of the covert
actions blurs the viewer‘s sense of
right and wrong, Cool ﬁlm. Added
bonus: the bad guy tools like a weird
cross between Suave Gutenberg and
Phil Hartman.

I Like it Like That

According to the Grinnell video
scene, this film does not exist. We
haven‘t the faintest clue what it’s
about. So we watched Hellbound:
Hellmirer Ill Clive Barker strikes
again in this no-holds—barred battle
between good and evil deep within
the bowels of Hell. Stylistically
brilliant, yet hauntingly disturbing,
on film proves once again that porn

gory, bulas Derek says, “1 like it like

Grumpy Old Men

The name says it all, folks. It stars
Jack Lemmon and Walther Mathau
as twocmbittered old men who ﬁght
for the affections of a beautiful new
neighbor. Sounds like a laugh not.
eh? Well, it is. We both liked italot.
Also, there’s a great appearance by
Burgess Meredith as an even
grumpier old man. Be sure to hang
around after the credits for the cool
out—lakes.
