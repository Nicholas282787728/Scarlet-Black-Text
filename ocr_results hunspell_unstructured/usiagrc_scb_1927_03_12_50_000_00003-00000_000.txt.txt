one to think that they were
out of order in the column. To .
' hose brave men who put out '

this column last week I will
say, that the reason I iuii so ’
many puns is due to the tool
that they are the lowest [oi-m ,

of wit. And it is my occupation

to render the type of wit that

befits my readers!

Horace w. Parsons is much taken
up with the study ot some ot Iowa’s
laws at present and in a few weeks
expects to be able to go to Des Moines

knew nothing of them,

It's one thing to sign your name to
what you say and admit that you said
it but to put out something and try
and act as it you didn't know any
thing about it is a wonderlul example
of a coward. )

It's funny how some people will
shun you the first part of the week
and then come and see you the last
part, especially when they think you
didn't iind out why they stayed away
the tirst part.

Writing a column is like doing any

"that's what you are supposed to do,"
but it it isn‘t so good all‘ you get is
a lot at adverse critisism.
