Score Second Convo Flop

Student government took a beating at the hands of
both the leaders and the stlldellt body at the convocation
yesterday. The entire affair reeked of failure.

The leaders must sllare in the blame. The program was
presented ill a manller which would fail to stimulate inter-
est in anyone. Dry facts are difficult to get across interest-
ingly to an active audience let alone one which was defi-
nitely bored. We fully realize this convocation was a first
attempt and we know that those who planlled it are capable
of accomplishing more. We hope they will profit froln theil
mistakes.

The problem of the student body is quite different. It
seems we have four types of students ill reference to the
problem. There are those who feel they have discovered the
futility of student government To them the indolenee of
the student body and the interference of the administration
will continue to block ally attempts at making student gov—
ernment anything- nlore than a puppet setup.

A portion of the student body belongs to that group of
people who are so lethargic that they are unable to summon
any interest ill anything. They have to be manipulated by
strings. Some consider themselves intellectuals. probably
because their sole accomplishment is their ability to read
a book. The world outside the pages matters little to them.

Finally there are those students who make a jest of the
entire procedure. It is these people who laugh heartily at
anything student- -1'uii who find a need for government when
they are producinn plays. g‘iiing dances or planning athletic
lctivities. '

Then they turn a belligerent eye upon the so-called
campus leaders when student government can’t help them.
No student organization has any importance to these people
until they run afoul of it. Then the first question is: Who
gave them the right to fine me?

We see hope for student government. There will have
to be more work alld much lnore support for it to graduate
from the puppet division. We feel certain. however, that it
will gladuate, We base this certainty ml the disli ’e of most
fl'CEACl'Il-Dklllg' indixiduals for the puppet idea. Let‘s start
right now to sever those strings!

Campus Step-Child

The closing of the library last week for installation of
the new heating system was an instance of lack of far-
sightedness on the part of the administration. The net re—
sult was the retarding of the required outside work of nuui~
BI'OUS students. ‘

\Ve are ce‘taln that for the privilege of reading class-
ass' 'ned matel ”ll, most students would have gladly put up
with the inconvenience of wraps if the library staff had
been able to do the same.

It seems unfortunate that the libra 'y is alwa 's the step,
child on the campus when it Comes to any repai s or instal—
lations. We ale certain that all the faculty would agree that
the libral; has to be the working hub of any campus. Stil-
dents are repeatedly told of the importance of the building
and yet when the step inside they find the walls are badly
in need of fixing and the ceiling leaks to the point of dauh

11g solue books beyond repair.

Grinllell. as all institution of higher learning,
maintain its library in the finest condition possible.

Where The re ’8 Smoke...

The mine 01 a fire dlill u ould seem to depend on one
1; e element of sulplise That element “as lacl
in the l‘ 'e drill held on south campus \\ ednesday night.

A fire drill such as that one is a farceia sensele
waste of time. When almost everyone on campus is aware
of a potential drl,il it has no Value.

\\e would suggest an explanation oi drill proce'dule at
all eally housemeeting Then, later, at a time unannounced
to house chairmen and housemothers. a drill could be call-
ed Instead o tuclents tlooping down a main stailuav
to answ'el 1011 call in the loggia. they should use the e\lt
they might use in case of fire, wlletllel it be stalls, a file
escape, oi the hallowed nolth door.

This plan would provide two benefits. It would be car-
ried out under all bllt actual conditions; it' would determine
uhetllel gills Could be awakened when they had no prior
kllouledge of the d1ill.

Loose hall does not have a uolking bell system. Girls in
residence there must be u alned by a ringing telephone in
case of fire. Would someone hear that buzzing noise. dulled
‘by a sound-proof telephone booth? Or would they be too
groggy with sleep to comprehend the sound '.7 We can answer
these questions only by having a fire drill which has not
lost its effectiveness because of rumor.
