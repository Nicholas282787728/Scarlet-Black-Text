“Lots ofpcoplcdidn'tknow who

Three of the Grinnell students,
senior Matt Atherton, junior Rollo
Glrando and sophomore Nagcl, were
among those who made it to the
second stage, which involved more
reading. Girando and Nagel were
also among the final eighteen given

“After I read mine they secr
tioned me off to a table to the side
and this other lady invited me to
come back next Wednesday," said
Girando, explaining the selection
process. “She gave me four scenes
and told metomeniorizethein which
was kind of annoying because it
heightened the anxiety."

ally nice and calmed me down. in
fact, I went halfway through the
scene and she stopped and said ‘Okay
lets start over!"

“Thehcartofthisonesccncwas
the more aggressive personality
threatening his psychiatrist and his
more innocent personality at the
same time.” said Girando about the
additional scene he read. “When I

actually got into the rage I pretty
well spent all my energy on that.”

“By the time 1 had to switch at
the end to the other personality it
was real natural because all that en-
ergyhadleftmc,”Girandoexplained.

“My eyes just kind of rolled
back and I faded into this sweet
fellow."

Auditions for the pan were also
held in Los Angeles. Fromthe screen
tests done there and in Chicago the
director will choose an actor. “I still
haven’t heard whetherI got it or not.
I intend to do this again but I'm not
overly optimistic about this onejusi
because its my ﬁrsttime,"saidNagcl.

“I guess it‘s better to be pessir
misiie and get the turn down than to
get my hopes up and get the turn
down."

“I just thought it was kind of a
fun thing to do and a good excuse to
go to Chicago. It was like one 01
those things your mom calls alcarn-
ing experience," said Kane.

The ﬁlm should be in theaters
