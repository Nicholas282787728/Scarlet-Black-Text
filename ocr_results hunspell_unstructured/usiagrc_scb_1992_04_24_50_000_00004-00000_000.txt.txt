Pregnant women: the choices they make
Three Grinnell students tell their stories

Michael and Angela Glover Kent

AngelaGloverKent’sparentswere
not happy to hear that she was pregr
nant. Nor were they thrilled when she
announced that she was having tlte
childandgettingmarried.Angcla also
found little support for her decision
among her friends on campus. The
Student Health Center strongly
pressed her to consider abortion. Ob—
viously their argument failed to im-
press her. Two years ago, Angela
gave birth to her son Alex and mare
ried her boyfriend Mike. The young
couple currently live in an unassum—
ing two»story home (purchased as an
invesu‘nent by Mike’s parents) with
Alex, 22 months, and the newest
memberofthefamilyJoshA months.

Angela, an avid prorlife supporter,
described her initial experience at the
Health Center with a mixture of dis-
belief and anger. “My pregnancy test
was positive, obviously," she said. “I
was not at all pleased. They immedi-
ately wanted to make me an appoint-
ment at the Emma Goldman Clinic
[an abortion clinic in Iowa City].
When I said no, they gave me some
pamphlets on the clinic. I said no
again and they said that they’ll give
me the weekend to think about it
When I didn’t show up bright and
early on Monday moniirig, they called
me and left a message with my room-
mate lhatil was theHeahh Center and
to return the callr“

Angela paused, adding in an even
tone, “That was dangerously close to
a breach of confidentiality." She
sighed, ”They didn’t think that it was
the right thing to do—— to have the
child. They started arguing with me
when I said no to the abortion.” A

friend in whom Angela confided also
asked her to consider abortion: “Her
mother offered to pay for me to fly out
to California and have one there."

This attitude was difficult to igr
nore,especiallyin the faceofsociety‘s
expectations for unmarried pregnant
women. “I grew up thinking 'Nice
girls don’tgetpregnant’ andlhalyour
life is ruined if you do. It's hard to
overcome that It's sort of what my
parents worried about— that I
wouldn’t finsh school, lhatMike and
I were getting married for the wrong
reasons, that we’d get divorced.”

Mike stood up and carried Alex to
bed. As hecamcinto lheliving room,
Angela questioned whether they
would have gotten married ifitweren’t
for Alex. He smiled and responded,
“Well, probably not then, We would
have waited until about now. Until
we‘dboth graduated.” They look over
at Iosh, who lies on his fuzzy blanket
under a sort of free-standing mobile
off of which colorful objects sway.

Settling back into thecouch with a
shrug,Mike pointed outthat the sexual
revolution during the 1960‘s opened
the doors to every sort of sexual prac-
tices. Pre-marital sex was suddenly
embraced, he explained. but preg-
nancy was not, Angela has also felt
that sort of discrimination, especially
when she chose not to have an abor-
Lion.

“I really find abortion repulsive,"
she said. “Society shouldn’t make
unmarried women feel like outcasts
no matter how they got pregnanti
rape. incesti if society didn’t make
women feel bad. . ." her voice trailed
off. Mike nodded as his wife ex-
pressed the pro-life views which the
couple share. “I could understand ifa

woman didn’t want to keep the baby
of a rapist,” she continued, “[but]
there are always people who want [to
adopt] babies."

Both Kcnts complained that the
atmosphere at Grinncll is more pro-
abortion than prochorce. Angela felt
very conspicuous as a pregnant
woman on campus. “People didn’t
know how to relate to me.” she said.
“When I was pregnant wtth Alex, I
had tokccpalow profile. I resentthat
I was made to feel uncomfortable.”

Things were easier last semester
with Angela’s second pregnancy as
“my classes were smaller and every
one knew me.” In both cases, hcr
professors were quite helpful: “All
my profs were really, really great
about it. My chem prof tutored me on
stuff that I needed help with and let
me set my own schedule. They were
all very flexible."

Angela took a semester off when
Alex was born, and she and Mike
shared child care responsibilities af~
ter she returned to classes. They had
him in part-time child care, but now
that Angela has graduated, she is at
home caring for the boys.

Mike graduates this spring and the
Kents are packing up and moving to
Madison, Wisconsin, where Angela
will bepursuing her doctorate in Bac-
teriology. The University of Wiseon»
sin is “great for families," according
to Angela. She is looking forward to
having half of her daycare cost cov—
ered by the university as well as a
comprehensive health insuranceplan.

tiny swing while his parents contemr
plated the thought. “Not for a while,”
Mike answered. “But eventually.”

Abortion: awoman's choice

By Ann Treistman

Julie Richards smiled and said,
“I‘d be glad to tell you my real name
except my old boyfriend is still on
campus.“ Richards had an abortion
when she was a ﬁrst-year student
and could not talk openly about the
procedure for almost two years after
ithappened.Itwasn'tuntillastspring
that she realized how pervasive
society’s negative view of abortion
was and how this had kept her silent.

“A gal I knew called me to tell me
that she was shocked to have heard
about [another woman’s] abortion. I
said, ‘Oh yeah? Well, I’ve had an
abortion, too, sister!w Richards
spoke into a phone receiver formed
by her thumb and pinkie finger. She
lumed herhand down and droppcdit
to the table with an audible click of
her tongue. “I never talked to her
again," she ﬁnished.

“I reacted negatively to that type
of stigma against a woman's ability
to make responsible decisions" she
explained. ”For the past two years, I
had felt sad. lust plain sad, And
ashamed. I felt incredibly unlucky
and wondered why it happened to
me. Those two years were certainly
nottheheightofmyself-conﬁdencc.”

“Telling people and making it
political was liberating for me in that
not only did I find support for my
decision. but I reaffirmed that I’d
done the right thing."

ing the fetus to term. “I ﬁrst really

shesaid.“Mymomwa538andpreg-

and afﬁrmatively in front of me.”
She lit a cigarette rind articulated

again the terms her parents had used:
“Terminate pregnancy. Abort fetus.
Itwasn’tapoliticalissueinmymin

Richards found out that she was
pregnant during Spring Break of her
first year. “I immediatelyknew 'Well.
I’ll have an abortion’," she recalled,
She didn’t tell her parents because of
the “stigma of irresponsible (not to
mention premarital) sex."

Although she made the dealsion
automatically, Richards stressed that
abortion was notan easy choice. “It’s
hard. You have to be either callous
and unfeeling or break down come
pletely. I alternated between the two:
callous and cold, unable to tell any-
one, and weak and sad."

The emotional trauma does not
end with theproeedure. Richards said
that for almost two years following
the abortion, she would become hys-
terical when her period was due: “I
was on the Pill but I would still freak
out. Sometimes I would cry, I was so
scared."

Recent prerlife commercials,
which feature a group of healthy
adopted children and the slogan
“Don’ttheydeservcthcrighttolifc’?”
anger Richards. According to her,
they only emphasize society's distor»
tion of the choices pregnant women
make: ‘Thcy completely belittle a
woman’s connection to her body and
the intimacy and importance ofa de»
cision to conceive and bear a child."

Richardsisvery positive aboutthe
choice that she made. “One of my
friends told me to look for the good in
the bad," she said, grinning. “Now I
know that I‘m fertile as the Missis-
sippi Delta. Later in life. when I am
ready financially and emotionally to
provide room in my life for another
life, I can get pregnant whenever I
want. Not only do I want abortion as
a choice. I want pregnancy as a
choice."
