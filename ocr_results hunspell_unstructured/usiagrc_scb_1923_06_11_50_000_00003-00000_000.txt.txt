vigorous policy which has worked illI
the interest of both the ind' 'it‘luztl and
the School.

The organization of the old student
government ior inon consisted merely
oi ll men's senate of twenty-ﬁve mem-
bers. The senate under this old plan,
embodied the judicial, legislative and
executive powers in one body. Town
men were not represented. The Oracle,
secret organization, carried on a policy
oi trial and punishment for such cases
as it saw fit to consider.

Credit Is Due Lantern.

The new plan or government was
instigated and planned by The Lantern
A constitution was dralied and sub»
mitted to a. vote of the men 01 the
school at a monster mass meeting held
late in January where it was passed by
a vote of 169 to 19. With its adoption
the old Senate and Oracle ceased to
exist.

A Student Court, consisting of nine
members elected by all the under
graduate men 471 the College, is the
main leatnre of the new constitution.
Two of these nine Court members are
juniors. and the constitution provides
that they shall hold over as member!

This Court has jurisdiction over all of-
lenses against College rules and ludi-

stitution, is very wide. The Court may

ant provisions is that any man reins-

since the origin, in lots, at the

has been marked development in the
size and scholastic standings oi the

The third dormitory contains eight

twenty ioui- students. As each build~

as each year many applicants are
