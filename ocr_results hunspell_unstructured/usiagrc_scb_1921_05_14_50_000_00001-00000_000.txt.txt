D‘ASHES AND DISTANCES

Seconds and Th‘ ds Will Decide
First Annual Grinnell.
Washington Dual.

The Pioneer t tck tcain opposes the
Washington Unnersity athletes on the
Piker's held at St, Louis this nfLel'r
noon. Comparative records seem L0
put the two teams on a par, and the
outcome is very hard to dope. The
Filters and the Pioneers have been
victorious in duals with Drake' by
practically the same scores, Wash-
ington will have a stronger team
against Grinncll than the one which
opposed Drake two weeks ago.

The Pioneers seem to have the edge
on the Pikers on the track, but are
weaker than Iheir rivals on the ﬁeld
Paulo can be counted on tor repeti-
tions oi his previous wins in the dashr

'es. Wright has a good chance to
torce his way into the scoring column
in the 220, and possibly in the 100.
With Paulu as the anchor map [or the
short relay, another win can‘be cred—

. ited to the Pioneers. The mile relay

‘will be closely contested, the Pikei‘s
expecting a win. The outcome of the
hurdles in doubtiul, hut Vinsel and
Clark can he expected to credit Gl-in»
hell with points in these events.

Grinnell has the edge on the longer
races, with the exception of the lie.
Rainer of Washington has been rune
hing this race in close to firty seconds.
but Winter will make him run to
win. Fearing and Cushman have good
chances in the hall! mile. Daugherty
Reece, and Higley can be counted on
lor the majority of the points in the
one and two mile events.

Filters Strong in Weights

Kramer of Washington will un—
doubtedly win the discus, as he re-
cently broke the Missouri Valley Con-
ference record with a hurl of 137 test.
Parker and Hicks will uphold the Pio-
neers in the weights. hut Crinnell is
handicapped by the absence of Jan-
ssen, who is suffering from ineligi-
bility. Vinsel will score heavily/in the
jumps, if the injuries which he sui-
fered at the first of the week do not
bother him.

Seconds and thirds will decide the

‘ meet this alternoon, and Washington
will have the advantage oi a larger
number of contestants. I: dope is
worth anything, the Pioneers stand a
good chance to win the meet but the
Pikers are counting on a few dark
horses to win tor them.

ITIMNS W SYSTEM

Meal System at Men's Dorms To
Be Modeled On That Now In
Use 'At Quadrangle.

NEW PLAN WILL BECOME
A EFFECTIVE NEXT YEAR

The men's dormitory dining room
next year is to be run on the some
basis as that in the leilldngle, he
coming to pliius just made public by
tho mlmlnistmiiou. This com. on w.
reached as a result at expo ment, in
| lrcrcnt methods or management du
ling the past iour yours, and lilose in
Cllmge oi the dining room are or the
opinion that the system cl having
(ill the incn in the dormitories cat in
the dining room is the only feasible
lplaui

Under the new system the charge
for board in the men's dining room
will be $130 a semester, payable at
the same time as the room l'ellt. Th
amounts to. z a week, which is
very much less than the men have
been iorocd to pay for board under
the calc system this year. 1t is also
thought that it is less than the men
would he forced to pay anywhere else.
if those lnen who can aiford to cat
several meals a week down town wish
to do so, they will still he pa ng less
for hoard than they me this year.

Builil Closer Unity

The assembly oi all the men at
meals will make tor a closer unity
of the college group. Some seating
arrangement which will he satisiac-
tory to the men will he worked out
next fall. The new system will make
possible the employment of many
students who wish to work for their
meals.

In view of the feet that the dining
room has suitered a large deficit this
year some change was necessary.
During the past week, which was
lan- , representative or the patronage
during the whole year, an average of
254 meals a day were served, and a
large percentage of these were tree
meals. Under the new system about
550 paid up meals a day will be served,
and this will enable the dining room
to operate on a paying basis. it is
pointed out that not even a college
can ariord to operate a dining room
on a losing basis.

When asked it she had ally state
ment to make about the new system
Mrs. Cline, who has charge of the tune
ing rooms at the Quadrangle and dor-
mitorle said. “Every eifort will he
made to keep the meals up to it very
high standard of cxccllency. Nothing
will be left undcnc to cooperate with
the men in developing a club spirit in
the dining room.”

it is diflicult to make any predic-
tions as to the probable Winner but
at present the dope seems to indicate
that it will be a close race between
East ncs Moinos and Gl'illnell for
first plhce. Both of these teams have
made good records this season and
the contest promises to be an inter-
esting one. But, of course, there is
always a possibility or some dark
horse breaking into the scoring col—
umn and upsetting all 'the dope.
At present little is known about the
individual performance of many of the
entrants. However, a tow men have
already done exceptional work this
year. Boettger, Grinnell, has been
putting the shot in remarkable rash-
ion and his rriends claim that he has
good chances or breaking the state
record. Another Grinnell man who
will probably break into the scoring
column is Rivers who took individual
honors in die recent Quadraugular
meet here. Harrington of Waverly is
expected to make a good showing in
the sprints, shot put, and high jump.
Undoubtedly many more good men
will be brought to light in the course
of the meet.
