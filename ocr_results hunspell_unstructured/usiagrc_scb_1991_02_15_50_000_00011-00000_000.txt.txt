Men Cagers lose last
home appearances

By Michael D. Patterson

Two home games this weekend
saw the Pioneers play like lekyll
and Hyde. The Grinnell Pioneers
men's basketball team came out
ﬂat on Friday against Cornell, and
were never really in the game,
falling to the Rams 96-83. Grinnell
then turned around and played the
confereneeAleading Monmouth
Fighting Scots tough all night. Un-
fortunately. the results were no
better.TheScotspulled away in the
laSt two minutes and beat the Pier
neers 100$}.

CoaehDavidArsenault said that
Friday night's pace was “the slowv
estwe’veplayed all year.” Grinnell
jumped outtoan 8-21ead,and hoped
to force a timeout and drop back
into a zone defense. It never hap-
pcnot‘l. Cornell battled back. took
the lead, and the Pioneers never got
into their game plan. Chris Heller
led the Rams with 20 points. while
Pioneer guard Alan Thomas con-
tinued his inspired play, leading all
Scorers with 23 pointsand a9 for 12
shooting performance.

in starkContrast,Grinnellplayed
what Arsenault called “the quick-
estgame we’ve played all season”
against Monmouth on Saturday.
Against Cornell the Pioneers shot
69 times. against Monmoum they
took 97 shots. Against Cornell, the
Pioneers were out-rebounded 39-
32. Grinnell out»rcl>0undcd a tall,
strong Monmouthtoam 6043! The

Pioneerswerchustlingupanddown
the floor, and taking sman shots.
The problem was that the shots
didn't go into the basket. Grinnell
shot a dismal 29 for 97 from the
ﬂoor, and that was the difference.

with 2:30 to go in the game, the
Pioneers cut the lead to 6 and had
two possessions to try and cut the
margin further. Again, the shots
just wouldn’t fall, and the Scots
pulled away lorthe vtetory. Robert
Richmond led all scorers with 27
[or Monmouth. Chris Jacobson led
Grinnell with 24 points, 18 boards,
and 4 blocks. lacobsen also scored
his 1000th pointasaPtonccrlatetn

Neal, BJ. John, and George
Mchmsey went out in style, com-
bining (or 20 rebounds.
