Limbeck, Apollo Sunshine and
Death Ships

Friday, 9 p.m.

Gardner Lounge

Somehow Gardner remains it wellrkept see
cret on our quiet campus. Nonetheless, whether
there are 10 people or a 100 people, strutting upon
nimble feet or sweatily moshing, Gardner can be a
dance party like no other, But Limbeck's imminent
arrival on Friday night begs the question: how do
you dance to altrcoumry?

Limbeck, Apollo Sunshine and Death Ships
take up the challenge. Limbcck appears to be a
bunch of guys with shaggy hair and a few scruffy
beards, playing songs about girls and the road on
your basic rock band instruments. Their scratchy,
almost precocious vocals betray their home base in
Orange county, Cali Their easy, rollicking guitar
melodies remind me of a much less self-impor-
tant, less cheese-ball John Mellcncnmp. They've
taken a page from old-school California rock. In
2003, they redid the Beach Boy’s album, “Hey,
Everything’s Fine," in their own image, re-o'tling
it “Hi, Everything’s Great." Their latest release,
“Let Mi: Come Home,” continues the tradition
of easy lovability. They sound like driving down a
dusty bumpy back—road on a summer afternoon at
a reasonable speed with your hand out the window.
How do you dance to that? Hopefully as amiably
as the band plays it.

Apollo Sunshine at ﬁrst seems to be more boys
with beards and guitars, among them the fabulous
pedal-steel, but they hail from the opposite coast.
Though they formed in Boston, they‘ve got the
old fashioned rock thing going for them too CIH‘
bracinga 605 soundwliile adding some hyper ens
ergetic beats, circus like sounds rind enjomble eso-
teric lyrics which run the gamut from “"lVIagnolia
to “Phone Set" to “God."The adventurous dancer
could have a heck of .\ time with their madrcap
music. .

Minus the Bear, Big Business and
These Arms are Snakes

Saturday, 9 p.m.

Gardner Lounge

This Saturday, Minus the Bear, Big Business,
and These Arms are Snakes will be rocking Gardr
ner Lounge, providing a brilliant mix ofindie, hard
rock and somewhere in between, a line up tbar is
sure to wet the palette of every true rock ‘n' roll fiin
in Grinnell, as well as appeal to the rest of the stu~
dent body.

Minus the Bear has only one possible descrip—
tor: ingenious. From Seattle, the indie band pmr
vides an eloquence that has been lost in ”modern
music. Their simple melody accentuates a complex
harmony, providing a sound that is not only pleas-
ant but also easy to dance to. The songs that grace
each album Minus has released are one of a kind,
on generir works such as Absinthe Party at the Fly
Honey Warehouse," "Get Me Naked 2: Electric
Boogaloo," and “Monkey!!! Knife!!! Fight!!!" Der
spite the often ludicrous song titles, Minus’s lyrics
speak to real—life situations and, often, have noth-
ing to do with flies, getting naked or knife fights.

Big Business also hails from Seattle, with a
powerful bass and a drumline to matcthiredWatr
ten and Coady Willis, the members of the band,
bring the edge of hard rock to this concert, with
plenty of guitar rifts and shrieked lyrics. Though
their music is powerﬁil, Big Business is only 3 M07
piece band, which left me wanting a fuller sound.
Big Business is full of energy, a factor that their
lyrics and rifts amplify and perpetuate.

It looks as if Concerts Chair Brendan Baker
may have fulﬁlled the goal of the public relations
scarf: bring bands to campus with a unique sound
that are relatively unknown, but have the potential
to put on a legendary performance.

How does Wright's work apply to the modern world?

It applies by asking some very hard questions about how the
world is pur together. And when 1 say put together, I mean in rcrms
ofinrernitional trade agreements diploimcy, foreign policy, or lack
thereof, [and] the conrinuing problem we have with the East versus
the West. Wright' is relevant to 2005 in the sense that you have a
writer who says as clearly as he could, writing in rhe 1950s, in the
Cold War period, that we all really have to wake up to whar's going
on in the world in a very serious way because 1 think we give lip ser-
vice to all kinds of things but whether or not people put themselves

behind what they say is another
question. 1 really have some see
rious doubts about how things
are being handled by our gov-
ernment and by other govern-
ments. ijust think that they're
embarrassing people and that
rhc American people and prob-
ably people in many other Mr
rions are being sold the Brooks
lyn Bridge.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, alotof what the news-
papers were saying was, “We thought this era of inequality and
segregation was over. This is history" And now we wonder how
much are positive change have we been making

VVell,we have to be fair to ourselves as American citizens] think
we have made many positive changes, but the one thing (hilt we
have not been able to do 7 and I'm not sure exactly how we would
be able to accomplish, I don’t have all the answers — is structural
change. So unless you have that kind of systemic change, you rc go,
ing to be caught always' in your status quo. i think we have to really
considei that how we receive information and especially those forms
ofinforniation that we think of as news might indeed conccil more
than it reveals. One ofthe pioblems that I detect with mass media
is thityou’re no longer able to discern the difference between enter-
tainment and informationTlie two have so merged that it reqiiiies
an extraordinary act to try to filter out, well this isjust supposed to
make people laugh and forget about their problems and this is sup
posed to really inform them abour the parameters of an issue iind
lead them to do their own research.

Where do you think the coverage of Hurricane Katrina fails
on this scale?

I think it falls more into the entertainment category than into
the information category If you want intormnrion about the «frets
math of Hurricane Katrina, out: of rhc rhiugs you have ro do ask
is how spotty the coverage has been. So the city I’m from, New
Orleans, gets a lot of attention. Mobile gets no attention. You hear
nothing about Biloxi or Gulf Fort. You can talk about the shrimping
industry for erampleWhar kind ofrcporrlng are you getting there?
I didn’t see anything in the Wall Street Journal on that. So, what
I'm saying is (hilt as you're trying to deal with what 1 have called

Ward/2 l 6717171!” for New 071mm [an Snlntlloy.
COURTESY O'CONNOR Pi-ioTocmi-iv

a national tragedy, if we depend on the most popular avenues of
informarion, we’re going to be shortchanged. What you have to do
if you really want to know what's going on is listen to the BBC, is
listen to short—wave radio. You can't depend on American media to
fill you in on things.

What do you think is being covered disproportionately?

1 think what’s been disproportionately focused on in terms of
New Orleans is the 9th Ward.I mean, it has become almost like a
legend in its own rime The 9th Ward has been basically porrmyed
us an area in a flood zone populared by people in dire poverty and
there has been no indication rhar peoplc in the 9th ward are working
class, not welfare class. [The city adniinistriirionl' is trying to isolate
that porrinn ofrhe city and keep people, who are trying ro salvage
what is left oftheir former dwellings, out They have threatened to
shoot people if they rry to get in. When you rhink about what is
really happening ‘in that particular area, you are encouraging it to de—
tcriorure to the point where you can legitimately argue it is beyond
salvationThis is a part ofwhat 1 call “the funky politics otrecovery."
We ire not being honesr nbour how extensive the damage is in the
citywhen you don't have real services ro even allow the people who
are trying to rebuild, to even be in the city.

Vthn I go back to my house, I don't have any electricity I have
water, and i can use that for cleaning things, bur that’s all I can do.
At this very inoment,I can't get good workmen to do anything there
until there’s electricity.., 1 do have some hope. I have a teaspoon hill
of hope 71 hope it grows into a tablespoon soon — but, you know,
I have to be very realistic We are facing ‘rl major problem. I am not
exceptionally happy with people who are rrying ro create this iturn
of optimism. 1 am not saying you should be totally pessimistic, but
let’s not go overboard, folks.
