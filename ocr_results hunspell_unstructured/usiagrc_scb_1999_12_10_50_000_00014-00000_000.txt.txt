"we may not be the fastest team

These are the Words ofeneoura
agement Coach Erin Hurley gave
us before we began rhe grueling
three—session, two-day swim meet
at Truman state this past weekend.

This preemect speech was also
before the swim teams suffered mi»
nor chlorine poisoning. Apparently,
the Truman state pool stair had
some difﬁculty monitoring the
chlorine level in rho pool, and due
to poor venrilarron on rhe deck,
everyone was hacking up a lung.
Still, in the face ofthis obstacle, the
Grinnell swim team put on a Stunt
ning performance.

Both teams outscored all other
NCAA-Division llI competition,
The Mad Dogs finished third over-
all (With 403 points) behind
Truman State and Southwest Mis-
souri State, while the Mild Ducks
took fourth (186), behind those

Title IX forces colleges

to make tough decisions
Gender equity law not all good

is lucky to have an opponent to

Thanks to Title IX, die 1972.

rhe nation have been under the

count vordand state, the Go-
phers Sunday opponent, as one
of those programs.

The Vikings have been under
fire from the university for about
four years. Why? The school
wanted to cut the sport's funding
to better comply with Title 1x.

And don't think orhersehools
didn’t rake notice. Minnesota as.
siscam coach Joe Russel says it's
not uncommon for wrestling to
hit me chopping bloek.

“I think in rhe past its been
rhar way because there‘s no
Women’s equivalent and they’re
just trying to get the numbers in
line," Russel said. “it's been hit
very hard.

But while porrland state faced
the executioner, coach Marlin
ctahn and a group of alumni

came up with a Solution: private
funding pfa collegeslcvcl sports
program.

The Vikings receive $68,000 a
year from srudenr fees. That’s their
entire budget. Grahn makes around
$30,000 and thi: rest is rcserved For
travel and supplies.

But does that mean the univer»
sity is gqlng [0 leave the team alone?
Grahri isn't so sure.

“You’d think nor, I guess we’ll
have to wait and see," he said, “As
long aswe raise the scholarships that
we offer, 1 think they're going to
leave us alone, because right now
they aren't funding us."

A self—funded varsity program
isn’t a bad idea on the surface, but
it sets a precedent rhar shouldn’t be
followed. The argument goes that
if the trend continues, the only
teams drawing money from univer-
siry hands will be rhose that make a
proﬁt, like men’s basketball, foot»
ball and (theoretically) women's
basketball,

“I think with gender equity—
thetc was something rhat needed to
be done," Gtahn said. “What’s hap»
pened is there‘s a fewsporrs in men's
and a few sports in women’s that
get a lor [of money] and there's a
whole bunch more that don‘r get
that much

“That's the reality ofwhzit gen»
der equity has done."

what Grahn is saying isn't new.
it seems like lately everybodys be»
moaning the loss of one team or

another to make room for another
women’s team.

But with Portland stares suc-
cess at maintaining its program
despite receiving no funds from

and stop cutting programs.

grams, rather man cut men’s to fit
a budget or any other concern.

But things aren't that bright
and shiny yet for wrestling.

“We’re still in forsomc tough
times, but theres some movement
for change," Gtahn said. "If we
sun seeing that movement and we
go where we’re adding programs
or at least stop cutting in the sake
of saying gender equity. then I'll
say we’ve made progress."

While all this cutting ofsports
has happened outside of Minne-
sota, Russelithe assistant Min-
nesota coach—says the Gophers
have been keeping a watchful eye
on the national scene.

There’s no telling when their
heads will be next on ihe block.

“You always have to be on
guard," he said. “In the Midwest,
wrestling is supported really well;
West coast is where it's hurting.

“we‘ve had a lot of support
from administration here but
you're deﬁnitely in a fight for your
sport. If not for your own team,
they’re dropping teams around
you and that makes it harder to
compete.”
