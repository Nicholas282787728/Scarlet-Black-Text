'STUDENT SEGTIUN NEW

FEATURE OF ‘REVIEW’

‘Senior Class Unanimously Suh-

scrihes to “Review” for
One Year.

A laburitto fee Bf $2.00 will he
charged freshmen in the tuture, for
which they are to receive the‘Grim-iell
Review (luri g the year, with a special
section inserted for undergraduate
contributions, according to TL measure
passed by the English department re~
cently. It is planned to print a sneer
iitl four-page insert for Contributions
from the freshmen English Classes,
which will be bound into the copies re—
ceived hy the students here only. This
'eCtion will not be Sent out on the reg—
Ilar mailing list.

The experiment being tried by the
department is to obtain student con—
tributions and enable student writers
to better judge their works by seeing
them in print. Negotiations are now
on with other Iowa. colleges to follow
the same plan, and it soccesstul, sbeCA
ial sections will be inserted in num-
hers sent to each college, with the
work of the students of that College in
them.

The seninr Class unanimously sub-
KDrilled for the Grinnell Review by
giving the proceeds of the Class play,
Captain Kidd, Jr., to the Grinncll Re-
view, in return tor a subscription for
each number. The subscriptions Will
run from one to two years, according

to the amount oi the proceeds. This
plan is a novel one, and assures every
member at the class a constant con-
iloction with Grinnell during the ﬁrst
year out of college at least. The class
hopes to keep organized through the
medium of the Review, and keep its
members iniormed oi the whereabouts

This gift of a halt-million dollars
to Criuuell is the largest made by the
Board to any American college and
is regarded by the Grinnell adminis-
tration as eloquent oi the high place
which the institution occupies in the
esteem of specialists who are thor‘
oughly familiar with collegiate affairs

Officials Inspect College

Announcement of the gilt followed
a visit of Dr. Wallace huttrick, Presi»
dent of the General Education Board,
and Trevor Arnet, secretary of that
body, to Grinnell College last Wed-
nesday where the day was spent with
President. John H. T. illain inspecting
the college and investigating its finana
cial condition.

As is usual when the great Foun-
kind the gift of $500,000 is conditional
upon the college raising 31,000,000
more, and a further condition is that
the money given by the General Ecu-
cation Board shall be considered as
.a permancutiund, the income irorn
1which shall be used to strengthen the
laculty and to increase thc salaries
or its members.

The signiiicanee‘of the gift, aside.
‘from its amount, was pointed out in
a statement issued last night by the
Alumni Campaign Committee which
‘said in part:
"To receive the largest gift made
,by the General Education Board to
any American college is a significant
distinction. That hoard probably has
more iniormation at command as a
lresult or its exhaustive surveys of ed—
ucational institutions than exists any
where else For the last six months

it has been making a new study of
the situation. it has sent question—
,aires to hundreds or colleges, and
‘tanalyzed their responses and their
claims. The colleges have been under
liscrutiny as to their linancial sound-
ness, their educational standards, and
every element in their aftairs.

Find Griiult‘ll Worthy

l "Finally the President and the Sec-
,retary oi the Board visited Grinnell to
apply the last measure of careful in~
spection this week This shows the
,thcroughness with which their great
ltrust is administered But it also he~
comes an authentication of Gl'mnell's
claims on the people of Iowa. it the
General Education Board tinds Grin-
lnell worthy of a slit of $500,000 cer—
ltzliuly no one can rcsuirc further evi—

 

wlcnce of the soundness of the insti<
ltutiou irom every point of view.
"The Board makes no statement
‘thit it regards such i‘luestions as stra—
tegic importance in the educational
world, momentum, educational inﬂu-
ence and the nlimhei'less other ques-
tions involved in college worl- But
it is impossible that the Foundation to
lwhieh the nockelellers have given
‘3150000000 to administer in the
cause of education should not have
taken cognizance or those things in
making this munllicent gitt, It is not
1to be doubted that the people at Iowa
will respond promptly and generously
to the efforts which Grinuell will now
push with renewed energy, so thltt
the conditions of the neckeieller gift
may he met."
Applies to Salaries

The only condition attached to this
gitt, other than the raising or the ads
ditional sum to make it ettective, is
that the laconic shall be entirely an~
plied to the salaries of teachers, either
for the expansion of the faculty or the
increase of isculty salaries. in other
words, it recognizes the theory that
the teaching staif is an element or
iinal importance in a college, and

that faculties must be properly Com-
