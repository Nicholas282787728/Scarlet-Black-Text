I At last week 3 commemoration ofthe life of Martin

rhar rho dry would also Fall during rhe semesrer in 2003
and 2004. Dean orrhc College Jim sivai-o. asked Wayne
Moycr, rolirieal Science, ro organize a eonimirree to Sc! u
sehedule oreveiirs for rhe 2003 holiday,

Moyer asked cps sriidcnrs and several professors and
adminisrrarors ro ioiii rhe Rosenrield eornrniiree, which
he heads, in braiiisrorming a celebrarion in whieh “rhe
whole coininiiniry would feel a sense orownership."

Aniong orher rhings, rliey deeided ro lisren so one of
Kings speeches

King visired Grinnell in ocrober 1967, s'ut months
before his dearh, as a key speaker in a symposium on “The
Libcrdl Airs College in a World orChange." Aboiir 5000
people packed Darby Gym ro hear rhe 38-year-old Baprisr
preaeher and Nobel laureare cxhort rhem ro rake aeriori
againsr injusriee, lnequality, iaeism, and violence ar home
and abroad. For Iasr week's eelebrrrion, Thomatho,

had been presenr for rhe visir_and sreve Andrews Enr
glish, edired an audiora‘pe orrhe speech for presenrarion in
Herrick Chapel on rhe evening orianuary 20

Editing dint speech, said Andrews, was inevitably ii
political process. “We came up wirh porrions rhar we relr
would speak nor only ro whar King was about in rhe con.
text or rhe 60s," he said. “we looked ar ocrrain rhings rhar
mighrsrill resonare today."

The result, made up oilive readings from currenr and
rormorsrudenis and excerpts in Kings own voice, was yux.

“To biing anorlier generdrion up under warsiirl blood.

rhar irmodern man coiirinues ro ﬂirt unhasitatingly wiih
war we can desrroy ourselves. But in a day when spurniks
and Explorers and Cominis sire dashing rhough ourer space
and guided ballisrie missiles are carving highways ordeaih
through rhc sri—irosphere, no narion can really win a war. "
