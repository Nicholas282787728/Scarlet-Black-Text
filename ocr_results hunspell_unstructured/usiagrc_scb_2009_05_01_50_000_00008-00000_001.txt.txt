the history

The ancestral homeland of the Tai Darn
(Black Tai) people resides primarily in four
nonhwestem provinces of Vietnam, a region
formerly referred to as Sip Song Chau Tai
(The Twelve Tai Frinclpalirits) or Muong

Tai (Tal Country). Muong Tai was an
autonomous kingdom situated in between
the larger nations of Laos, China, and
Viemam until the end of the 19th Century,
when the French aggressively colonized the
entire region of Southeast Asia (Indochina).
Anncxod to the French territory of Tonkin
(North Vietnam) in 1888, Muong Tal would
lose its sovereignty, but remain undisturbed
for 60 years under ofFrench—Vietnamese rule.

During World war II, Muong Tai's
geographic location at rhc crossroads of
China and French Indochina made it a
valuable holding ground for the conﬂicts
larger beulgerents and in March 1945,
Japans Imperial Army successfully invaded
the region, shortly disposing of the French
occupation. Following theJapanesc surrender
at the end of the War, France reestablished
its presence in Muong Tal in February of
1946. However, their retum to the region

vwas greeted by emergent non Tai Dam guerrilla
and political groups, such as the Vier Minh,
the Pathet Lao, and the Khmer Issarak, which
challenged the French hold in the region.

In March 1948, in an attempt to fortify their
political and military interests in Indochina, the
French created the Tai Federation or Sip Hok
Chau Tal, the Sixteen Tai Principaliries. As a
semirindependcnt and short—ﬁred protectorate,
the Tel Federation allied with the French to
combat the communist Viet Minh forces during
the First Indochina War (19464954). But
waning French presence in Indochina led to the
evacuation of top Tai Dam diplomats, esteemed
military officers, members ofthe French Foreign
Legion, and their families in Novmnber of 1952
to Hanoi,which remained under tenuous French
control.

Ultimately, the decisive Viet Minh Victory at
Dien Bien Phu and the resulting Geneva Accords
of 1954 marked the end of French colonial rule
in Indochina, the division of Vietnam, and
the gradual dissolution of the Tai Federation
into North Vietnam. The Tai Federation was
renamed the TairMeo Autonomous Zone 3
year later and then changed to the Northwest

Autonomous Zone in 1962, a distinction that
would be abolished entirely after the uniﬁcation
ofViemam in 1975.

Fearful of communist persecution, Lhe Tai
Dam in Hanoi as well as a number of families
in the defunct Tai Federation ﬂed as refugees to
South Vietnam and Laos injuly of 1954, where
rhey would live and work for appronmarely
20 years. However, the communization of
Cambodia, South Vietnam and Laos forcibly
uprooted rhese Tal Dam communities in 1975.
Seeking asylum in Thailand, thousands of Tai
Dam families covertly crossed the Mekong River
to live in poorly maintained refugee camps, again
leaving behind their livelihoods for an uncertain
future.

Unable to permanently resettle in Thailand.
the Tal Dam reﬁigee community migrated to
countries such as France, Canada, Australia, and
the United States. As conditions continued to
deteriorate in the region and with the number
of reﬁlgecs growing every day, President Ford
implored govcmors of each state to accept
persons displaced by the conﬂict. In 1975, Iowa
Governor Robert Ray responded by establishing
the Task Force for Indochinese Resettlement

which opened the state to Southeast Asian
rciilgees.

After welcoming 1,200 initial refugees to
the state, Goiemor Ray's resolve to help the
Tai Dam was strengthened after witnessing
a television documentary on the group’s
continued suirerlng. Dubbing the Tal the
“boat people," the program broadcasted jarring
images of Tal Dam people fleeing Vietnam
in 1e boars, many of which sank or were
capsized, Moved by their concinued plight, Ray
offered to more than double the number ofTai
Dam in the state. Despite Ray's intentions,
then, as now, some Iowans were unhappy
about hosting a large inﬂux of immigrants.
In addition to sheer xenophobia, many feared
that the new residents would take jobs from
Iowans.th in the face of this opposition. Ray
expanded his state‘s assistance.

Currently. 70 to 80 percent of all Tal Darn
living in the United Starcs reside in Iowa. The
Iowa Bureau of Refugee sovioes is the only
state body ofﬁcially recognized by the Stare
Department as a resettlement agency Two
years ago, ground was broken on the ﬁrst Tal
Darn community center in Des Moines.
