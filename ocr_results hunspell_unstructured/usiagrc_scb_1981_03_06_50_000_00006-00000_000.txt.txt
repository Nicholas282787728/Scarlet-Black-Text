by Chris Hampl

Every winter season is a busy time
(or the people at the Student Health Sere
vice and this year was no exception.
The Service treated the normal number
of winter colds that result from
students spending a greater amount oi
time together inside. in addition,
Health Center Supervisor Irma Hall
reported several cases or chicken pox
and multiple cases of influenza
meriting an epidemic.

Influenza epidemics on college cam-
puses are always severe. Dormitories
and close living conditions ensure that
many students are bitten by the nu bug,
causing them to [eel miserable and [all
behind in their academic work, This
year's epidemic was additionally tough
to battle because it was a new strain oi

'the virus of which there is as yet no
established cure. Many of the symp»
toms reported included high lever,
muscle aches, chills and stomach
pains. These symptoms seem to iit the
typeA Bangkok variety but no oiiicial
label has been placed on cases treated
by the Health Service.

This semester the Health Service has
reported three cases at chicken pox. the
last case recently released {mm the
center, Chicken pox or "vancella" is a

Joint Board revises SGA election procedures

by Bob Utke

After two weeks of long legislation
the members at the Joint Board seemed
relieved to have a short meeting. Last
Wednesday's agenda listed only a cou~
ple of iunding requests and the second
reading of a Bylaws revision concern-
ing election procedures.

The reviswn, which has been debated
in two previous meetings, passed its see
cond reading. it is now a part of the Stu-
dent Government Association constitu-
tion. The revision is designed to limit
the number of run—oil’s in the presiden-
tial and vice-presidential elections. It
also states that presidential and vice-
presidential elections will occur on the
same day. It is hoped that this measure
will help to restore a sense or
seriousness to SGA's image, The JB
reasoned that if the students did not
take the elections seriously, then they
probably did not take the ottices very
seriously either

Jeti Meisles made a motion to revise
the Bylaws so that in the event that a

6

committee opening should occur "the
cabinet must announced the vacancy in
the campus MEMO within one week oi
learning oi the opening and hold inter-
views ior the position within two
weeks."

This motion was amended by George
Turnbull to include that "All commits
tees shall be selected by rail break "
Turnbull argued that this amendment
was necessary because many commits
tees were not selected until late in the
lirst semester this year He tell that
this compromised their operating elli-
ciency. The amendment passed and the
original motion passed as well. Beiore
it can enter into the Bylaws it must pass
a second reading at the next meeting.

The JB also voted to grant $250 to
Spanish House lor their Spanish Week
activities. At the end oi the meeting the
general budget stood at $817

Chris Nylander announced that there
would be a Schlocky Film Festival later

this semester. He also reported that
talk Singer Jim Post would be playing
here again this year,
