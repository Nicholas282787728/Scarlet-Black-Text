Grinnell student founds and begins the
College’s first ever bone marrow drive

Jessica Reidies ‘09 organized the event that will provide marrow to needy recipients

BVMARCUS ZEITZ

Dozens of Grinnell College students generously donate
ar blood drives throughout the academic y - A new proce
dure, coming to the College for the
first time, will offer students another
opportunity to save lives.

Jessica Reidies ’09 is organizing
a campus marrow donation drive for
this coming Wednesday, April 8. At
the drive, which will [ch place from
9 am to 3 p.m.in]RC101,studcnts
will register for a national registry of
marrow donors.

According to Reidies, such a
drive is a first for Grinnell Col—
icgc. Marrow drives are becoming
more common on collcgc campuses,
which have bccome cxccllcnt sources for registering potential
donors. “The 20»Something demographic is a fairly philanr
thropic age," Reidies said.

The registration is a 157minute procedure, according to
Colleen Chaplcau, associate director of the Iowa Marrow
Donor Program. Students fill out paperwork and swab their
checks. “We need to get a DNA sample from [the regis-
trants]," Chaplcau said, in order to determine ifthelr mar-
row marches a recipient’s.

“or all rhe people who join the registry, less than two
percent will actually match a
patient in need," Chaps
leau said. “The chances
are small that any one
particular person
whojoins will go on
to donate."

According to the
National Marrow Doe
not Program, every day thous
sands ofpatients search for a life-
saving bone marrow transplant. 30
percent of these patients find donors
within their families, while the other
70 percent must search outside their
families for a matching tissue type.

For Ragnar Thoiisson ’11, bone marrow donation has an
especially personal signiﬁcance.

three rounds of chemotherapy before doctors concluded his
cancer was resistant to the tieatment.

“I needed a bone marrow transplant to become healthy

again,”Tliorissoii said.

Foitunately, Thorisson‘s brother
was a march, and he was ablc to ice
ceive a transplant. “1 was very lucky in
that case,"Thorisson said. “Having the
means of a good match for the bone
marrow is especially important to
avoid complications postrtransplant.”

Unlike blood donations, the ie-
quiiements for a donor-recipient
match are more stringent and exclu-
sive, and results eta mismatch can be
dangerous. Complications include rhe
potentially fatal Graft vs. Host dis
ease, in which rhe body rejects a poorly matched transplant.

Reidies became interested in marrow donation when she
noticed an ad on a Native American website she was Icscarcl‘lr
ing. “It’s more likely to find a match within [one’s] ethnic
group,"Rcidies said. “There’s a critical need for ethnic minor-
ity donors."

The actual donation process
1 can he done in two ways. One,
the traditional bone marrow
- procedure, involves a simple
outpatient procedure, per-
formed under anesthesia. Do—
nors arc sore after the procedure
and must rest for 2 to 3 days.“Most
people donate Thursday or Friday,
and are back to their routine by Monday,"
Chaplcau said.
Another, newer method, called Peripheral
Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) donation, uses a drug to stimr
ulate stem cell production and removes stem cells from the
blood through aphercsis, which separates red blood cells from
the marrow needed for the donor. At the end of the proce-
durc, the red blood cells are returned to the donor, causing less
complications than the traditional method.

“The people who donated for us reli us that the experir
ence for them wasn't the physical experience,"c1iaplcau said.
“It was the emotional experience in knowing they got to play
such an important part in an effort to save somebody’s life."
