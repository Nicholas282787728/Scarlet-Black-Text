Friend Given $250
ln Salary Dispule

by Betsy Gilman

The largest part of Monday
night's Senate meetingwas sp-
ent reviewing the Publications
Committee's decision to grant
Jim Friend only part of his
first semester salaryas busi-
ness manager of the S h B.
Friend quit at the beginning of
this semester, and the Publi-
cations Committee, regarding
it as a breach ofan oral cons
tract, voted to punish him by
giving him only $100 of the
$250 due. The Senatereviewed
this action at the request of
Greg Butcher, S & B editor.

Butcher and Friend argued
that no harm was done to the
paper by Friend’s resignation
and the job is being done by
a well-trained and motivated
man (Alan Schoene).

David Jordan, speaking for
the majority of the Publica-
tions Committee, argued that
Friend's action has had a bad
effect on staff unity and serr
ved as a bad precedent.

The minority opinion of the
committee, voiced by James
Hottois, was that the commit-
tee has no right to take away
Friend’s salary for work al-
ready done.

The basic disagreement con-
cerned the purpose ofa salary.
The majority of the Publica-
tions Committee felt that it
should be an incentive, while
the minority and quite a few
Senators maintained that it
was only repayment for time
and effort put into a job.

The upshor of the debate was
that the Senate veted 5 to i
with 3 absentions to give Fr—
iend his full first semester
salary. The Publications
Committee mentioned that
there will be a written clause
in next year’s contracts to
avoid a similar occurrence.

In other matters, the Senate
heard how John McDonald lost
$30 by chartering a bus to St.
Louis at the beginning of Che
tistmas vacation. Some 30

people made reservations on
die understanding that itwouid
cost no more than $13, per—
haps less. At the last moment

3 cancelled out, so McDonald
had to pay the rest. Upon Greg
Vranicar's recommendation,
he submitted the case to the
Senate hoping to get some
remuneration. Though all the
Senators thoroughly under-
stood his feelings and were
sorry it happened, they didnot
vote to compensate him be-
cause they didn't want to set
such a precedent.

The next Saga Fast is to be
for the benefit of the Martin
Luther KingScholarship Fund.
The same night there will be
a soul food dinner, the pro—
ceeds of which will also go
to the fund.

Tuesday's meeting was to
have been an informaldiscus'
sion of the house presidential
election referendum. Since
few noanenators appeared,
the meeting was very brief.
General Senate opinion was
that students favor the pro-
posed change.

Conversation then turned to
the Saturday theft of the Quad
I.D. card box. By Wednesday
afternoon, as this is written,
the box had not been recov
ered. SAGA‘s demand that all
Quad diners present their own
I.D.'s has not encouraged re
turn of the box. A "ransom
note” demanding a bagels-
andrlox breakfast in exchange
for the box - was received by
SAGA but has not been def?
initeiy linked to the theft.
Changes in the structure of
independents and possibilities
for extended pass—fail grad-
ing were alsodiscussed. Some
information about the latter:
2/3 of the people who take a '
course for "credit" earn a
grade in that course which is
higher than their cumulative
average. In otherwords, many
people hurt themselves by
sacrificing a good grade for a
credit."

Misilter Dooley Sees The Elep Imni

by Tim Porges

It has been, [am afraid, a“,
other week. I was going to
write a column this week on
the subject of professionals
ism, replete with images and
suchlike. I had a couple of
characters of which I had be
come quite fond, including an
elephant, or Truthfui Beast
(the elephant was the closest
animal that I could think of to
an institution, except for the
python, who is too linear, the
whale, who is in another coir
test, and the hippopotamus, of
whom Belloc has written, “I
shoot the hippopotamus/with
bullets made of platinum/be-
cause if I use leaden ones/
his hide is sure to flatten
’em", is such a shameless
dualist that I will have no
truck with him, by God!), Mr.
Dooley, a fat man, and the
good student Schweik. But i
didn't write that one, but this
instead, because after all, the
office of the press is toamuse.
The Faculty met at 4:15 on
Monday and wenthomeat5235.
They decided What might be
the mlendar year of the local
liberal arts next year, and
discussed the moral condition
of modern American Youth
with Glenn Leggett.

Because nobody could think
of a goodb reason why it
shouldn’t be, neXt year’s

spring calendar will be just
like this one's.

The Fall semester calendar
was another matter entirely.
There were, within the orie
ginal proposal, two breaks
allotted us; one at midssemr
ester and one just before
exams, four days each. Mes-
sers Guroff & Kintner sug*
gested a problemmaticai al-
ternative schedule which
would provide for a nine day
break at mid—semester.

The final killing point in this
affair was whether or notStu-
dents would be given the option
of remaining on campus during
such an extended break. The
Faculty was rather brusquely
reminded by the President
that it had no real power in
such affairs (it being an Ad
ministrative Decision). Pres.
Leggett went on to say that it
was the probable position of
the administration (he didn't
have his mind completely
made up yet) that the Idle Stu-
dent Is The Devil's Flaything,
and that itwouldbe impossible
to leave us alone here for a
week or more. Heaven only
knows what we might do. Chew
up the furniture or something.

Having discovered that ithad
no decision to make, really,
the Faculty took the better
part of valor and good sense
and voted to approve the pro-

posal as it stood. Subsequent
efforts by Mr. Bowers to ch-
ange the date of one of the
breaks so as to conform to his
game schedule seem to have
been ineffective, but by that
time a thick cloud had desn
cended, and dinnertime loom-
ed large in the hearts of the
multitude.

Well, Spring Break is com*
ing, and it's time to remind
you all that if you manage to
find yourselves at home. be
sure to REGISTER TO VOTE.
You can't do it too early, at
least not much, and it tends to
be something you forget. Ifyou
can‘t find out where from your
parents, consult your local
Committeeman, of eitherpar-
tyWords of Wisdom of the
week: "You know, we'll pres
bably none of us get outofthis
world alive?"

If you want to spruce up beat
your room and your diet, you
can get pots of fresh chives,
growing and alive, at Hl- Vee.
It’s a nice walk, if you take
fifth or seventh, about a block
west of the booze farm. They
also had some good Esmrole,
last time i went.

I am going to spend Spring
Break teaching a cockroach
how to wrestle. Can you see
someone trying to wrestle a
cockroach?

Ask For Referendum "Yes"

Dear Sir:

In the next couple of weeks
there will be severalreferen-
dums on issues of vital cont
cern to the Grinnell student
body. The change in the pros
oedure of eleCtion of house
presidents, the abolition of
the Senate, and the judicial
council reform‘ are all ex
tremely important changes in
the constitution. If passed,
these adjustments will make
the decision-making apparr
atus of the SGA farbetter than
the present structure. These
improvements will also be a

Says Senate Should Remain

by Dave Bensley
and Al Cohen

The argument for abolishing
the Senate rests upon the as?
sumption that with the inclu-
sion of students on commit-
tees in virtually all areas of
campus policy, there will be
little left for the Senate to do.
From this, it is therefore
concluded that the House Pre-
sidents as a group will be
able to absorb these few func
tions quite easily.

We would contend, however,
that there are at leasttwoim-
portant and time-consuming
functions which will yet re-
main for whatever body as‘
sumes the role now played by
the Senate. To explain the first
of these, some background
should be presented. This year
the student role in college
decision-making has achieved
its highest level ever. Part of
this is formalized in the com-
mittee structure. The other
part, has been carried out be
cause of excellent communi-
cation between Burling Bases
ment and the four SGA Execu-
tive Cabinet Officers. These
four have done wellinattemps
ting to represent the student
point of view.

But how representative are
{our people? We would main-
tain that the broader the base
of student opinionprcscntezito
the Administration, the better
This is not to assert that a
Senate often is truly reprcsw

entative of the student body.
It never can be. But we be-
lieve that fourteen is substan*
tially better than four. Presir
dent Leggett has agreed to
meet with a body of students
next year on a weekly basis
to discuss policy decisions
and issues affecting the cam-
pus. Some group must be av~
ailabie to meet with him, They
must also have some time to
pursue questions outside the
meeting, if necessary.

The second function of the
Senate next year would beact»
ing as a ”watchdog" over our
eversincreasing committee
structure. At present, come
mittees are appomted by the
Senate on the basis of a five
to ten minute long interview.
Interviews cannot be longer
because of the fairly large
number of applicants. After
appointments are made, these
two or three student memb-
ers of a committee are come
pletely autonomous in their
decision- making! Further-
more, our experience this
year has sometimes been that
topics have been discussedand
dealt with in committees with
out anyone ever hearing about
it until much later.

It seems to us that the dic-
tates of a sound political
structure would require that
there be some sort of student
group to watch what student
representatives on this array
of committees are doing. This
could be accomplished byperr

iodically calling in members
of each committee and finding
out first-hand what that come
mittee is doing. Standard act-
ion to be taken in case ofhuge
disagreement shouldbe decid—
ed. All of this would require
a definite time committment
on the part of senators.

It seems to us that House
Presidents run for office be-
cause they want to promote
hall social activities and gen-
erally make the hall a some
what harmonious enjoyable
residence. Therefore, it
seems unfair beth to the House
Presidents, and to student
government to require that
presidents have the interest
and the time for the two Sen-
atorial functions we have
named.

The final point of those who
would abolish the Senate con-
cerns the role of the ”new"
Vice President of the Hall.
Under the referendum which
will be vored on before the
5&8 appears this week, House
Presidents would be elected
by the people in each resid-
ence unit after room draw.
The President would run on a
joint ticket with a vice-Pre-
sident. The argument is that
the House President could
delegate his Senatorial duties
to his vice-President, or viccs
verso, thereby allowing en-
ough time for each to carry
out his responsibility. We be-
lieve that this really muddles

(continued to page 6)

big step towards strengthens
ing the living situation within
the halls.

The judicial council ims
provements are the culmina-
tion ofa year's effort tomake
the judicial system more
workable. Such important is-
sues as judicial review, open
hearings‘and appeal‘are dealt
with in the changes. The rela-
tive powers of thehallandall»
campus judicial councils are
also delineated. The election
of house presidents from the
group of people thathas drawn
into the hall is a positive step
towards bringing a sense of
unity into the hall. Both of
these proposals are soundand
deserve 'yes’ votes.

The third proposal, to elim-
inate the Senate, has raised
a good deal of controversy.
It is our opinion that the Sen-
ate has outlivedlts usefulness.
So much of the responsibility
has been transfered to the
committees thatlittle remains
for the Senate to do, and that
little is a very unrewarding
and frustrating job. The resn
ponsibilities of the budget
committee and appointments

Applications for next year’s

The Counseling Committee
hopes to expand the SA prog~
ram for next year (there are
44 SAs this year).

are, however, extremely im—
portant and need to be as-
sumed by some elected stud-
ent group. The logical group
to do this is the AWS/CofHP
boards. They, too, have seen
their importance decline in
the last few years. It is our
feeling that the combination
of the'tWo jobs, along'with the
change in the electionptocedr
ure, could make the role of
being an elected student rep-
resentative rewarding again.
It would be impossible forus
to stress the importance of
this change too much. If the
present kind of Senate is re»
tained studentgovernment will
probably collapse next year.
If you are considering voting
against the proposal you
should sincerely consider
whether or not you, personal-
ly, would be willing to run, for
that Senate. If not, we think
that the change we are pro-
posing will yield a more sat-
isfactory student government
for you.

Editor:

1 object to the criticism of
Mrs. Dennis in the "A Forum
for the Students?” article in
last week's S St E. She does
as fine a job as the other two
ladies at the Forum desk. I
feel that it was unfair to cri-
ticize her over sucha minor
issue.
