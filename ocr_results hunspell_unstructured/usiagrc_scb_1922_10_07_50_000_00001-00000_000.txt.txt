Miss Sydney Thompson, appearing
in an evening's program of dramati—
I'zation, impersonation and music, at
Herrick Chapel October 31, will he,
the opening attraction of the Grin—
Inell College Lecture Course.

In “past years the lecture courses
have been rather heavy, due to lack of
in the programs;
but this year the faculty committee
in charge has determined to.hring to
Grinnell the best and most popular
talent available, thus insuring a
course of universal interest.

The opening number will be. par—
ticularly entertaining, as Miss
Thompson is sonsidered an actress of
unusual distinction. Her program.
which is dramatic, poetic, musical,
and floodcd’with color and romance,
will be divided into three parts.

Apllclll's in Four Roles.

The ﬁrst part will consist of an
original play, "The Letter of in.
troduction" in which she will appear
Simultaneously as the star, the play—
vright‘, the producer, and the entire
Castift feftt in Dramatic Entertain-
ment which, done in the Sydney
Thompson style, is better acted, and
for more worth while as an entertain—
ment than many a costly and crowded
"show.” In commenting on her
technique, the New York Tribune
says, “Miss Thompson speaks agree-
ably and characterizes well, but the
most impressive part of her per—
formance is the fashion in which she
gives almost,eorporeal visibility to
several characters on an actually
empty stage, and makes them walk
and talk in accordance with the most
accomplished style of stage direction."
,The second part will consist of
Tales from the Old French, and lied-
ic ll Ballads, given in costume. in
her interpretation and presentation of
old ballads and remote folh lore Miss
Thompson is unsurpassed. Dr. Frank
Crane wrote, in the New York Globe,
