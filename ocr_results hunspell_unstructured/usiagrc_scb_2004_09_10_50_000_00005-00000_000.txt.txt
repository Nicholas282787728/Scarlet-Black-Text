Laundry rooms proved only mediocre as S&B staffers reviewed sleeping spots on campus.

Sleeping spots reviewed

Napping seems to be very serious business at

Grinnell College. Kirsten Aho and Emilia Garvey

joined the dozing masses of college students
and thoroughly investigated some of the most
and least popular sleeping spots on campus us-
ing highly scientific methods.

KIRSTEN: I brought my backpack and jacket with me to the
inside of the Jungle Gym. I used my backpack as a pillow, as
there was no place to lay my head, and wound up with back»
pack lines on my face. My jacket was useful in combating the
cold temperatures and slight breeze blowing on me (despite
being indoors). Grade: A

EMILIA! I went to the Burling second-floorterrace armed with
history reading. Although everyone can see in the window,I
felt perfectly isolated, with only the sweet sounds of students
typing to lull me to an academic dreamland as my book fell
softly to the floor.

K: I expected heat and sunlight, but this was excessive. I
brought an umbrella to keep the sunlight away, since I sleep
best in dark places. But the sun was merciless. I was sweating
profusely after 15 minutes, at which point I said, "Forget you
roof, I am going in." Grade: C

E: Sleeping on the roof was a happy accident. Iwas trying

to do some homework on my blanket. Next thing I knew, my
roommate was laughing at me and I was completely disori-
ented. A few minutes later, she was out on the roof, taking
her own amazing roof-nap. Grade: M

K: Ithought it was a nice day, but the random gusts of wind
proved me wrong. When the wind blew it would surprise me
out of sleeping,.so I put a blanket on. The bhnket made it
impossible to sleep, however, because once the wind stopped,
it was too hot. Grade: B

E: Did you know that from Mac Field the campus power plant
sounds like airplanes ﬂying overhead? Neither did I, untilI

lay down on my pink blanket in the cool afternoon. I counted
sheep for a long time to no avail. Good for a game of Frisbee,
sure. Good for nap? Surpﬁsingly, not so much. Grade: C

K: The laundry room has a two toned temperature, with

the coldness of Main Lounge and the warmth of the dryers
contrasting with one another. I used my backpack as a shield
against the sharp edges of walls digging into me. The dryer
gave me a gentle massage while I slept, vibrating against my
back. Grade: C

E: I looked fondly at machine #17 then went to the back row
of laundry machines. Curled up with my head on my backpack,
my knees against the heating grate, my back against the laun-
dry machines and the sun shining through the window, I felt
completely safe, if a bit weird for sleeping‘in a laundry room.
Grade: B-

K: My own room was a bit ora trouble, since it tended to be
too hot when I tried to sleep. Also, there were sometimes loud
noises nearby, such as a lawn mower outside my window. A
remedy? None I can think of...

E: My sweet mass-issued bed in International Gourmet House
is a little too long and gets a little too warm. But since it’s the
place i am used to sleeping, and the place a lot of fun things
(like English homework) happen, I can't help but let it know: I
love you, bed, and I am sticking with you. Grade: B

K: Holy fazoli, I shouldn’t have stayed as long as I did. I
should have used the emergency exit to escape into the cool
night. Z slept, but woke up all sweaty and gross feeling, since
it was too hot. The sleeping surface needed to be more cushi»
any and bigger. Grade: D

E: I covet Bob’s comfy droopy couches. Alas, a busy Saturday
night found them full of regulars engaging in serious philo-
sophical intercourse. Although I’m sure Bob’s would have been
good for a nap, the lack of space deterred me entirely.

Grade: F

In sum: Nappy? Go to the library. Wide awake?
Go to Bob’s because you won’t sleep a wink.
Good luck napping, fellow Grinnellians!

 

 

A day in
the life

Lucy Hubbell

RLC for Loose,
Read and Haines

12 A.M. I am the
RLC on~call on this
particular evening, so
during the first four
hours of the day I tend to those who need my
help.

4 A.M. My weary and aching body welcomes
a long overdue rest. In my role as Sleeping
Beauty, I am quite content and know I am
sleeping well, for I do not wake up at all.

8 AM. I am rudely awakened by the telephone.
I hope it is not Security calling to send me
on to another crisis, because this Sleeping
Beauty ain't no beauty at 8 am! Instead, it
is a student’s mother who somehow has my
number written down as her daughter’s. Oh
well! I shower and transform Sleeping Beauty
into someone who is presentable to the world.

9 A.M. On the way to the doctor’s office for
some routine blood tests, I stop at Grinnell
Coffee company for a blueberry scone. 1 have
been fasting since 9:15 last night, so the
Scone is my treat for going so long without
eating.

9:15 A.M. I wait a total of 20 minutes for
them to take two minutes to draw blood.
ARGHl

9:40 AM. I drive myself back to campus,
spend 10 minutes looking for a parking space,
and then head to Harris for an RLC Meeting.
All] can say is trying to ﬁnd a parking spot in
a lot during the day = yuckl

lo A.M. th meeting with all six RLCs, Director
of Residence Life Sheree Andrews and Dean of

sociate Dean for Experiential Education Steve
Langerud to discuss options for getting some
experience in the cup.

3:15 l>.M. I take my cat Cleo to the veterinary
clinic in town. She pulls her usual shenanir
gans of not wanting to get out of her cat car
rier and growling at the veterinarian. At nine
months old, she weighs only eight pounds, so
her growl is way bigger than she is!

nap. Cleo is actually feeling affectionate (a
rare occurrence during the day) and sleeps
with me on the couch.

4:30 P.M. Onerunrone appointment with an SA

student leaders about needs of the SRC. We
are even closer to having the SRC set up!
