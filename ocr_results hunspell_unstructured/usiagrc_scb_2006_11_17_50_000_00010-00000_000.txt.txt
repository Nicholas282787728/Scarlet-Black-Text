Dr. Thorburn ’92 amOng cycling’ 5 best

BYJULIA BoTTLEs

She‘s one of the fastest women in the world on a road bike.

She placed fourth in the 24~km Time Trial at the 2004
Olympicp Games ln Athens.

She attended the Stanford University School of Medicine
and is a practicing doctor.

And she’s a Grinncllian.

Christine Thorburn ’92 placed third in the Women's Elite
World Championship TimeTrial held in Salzbnrg, Austria, on
Sept. 20, solidifying her place as one of the fastest women in
cycling. But Thorburn is not just a world—class athlete. After
receiving her bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Grinnell, she
attended the Stanford University School of Medicine, accept-
ing a postdoctoral fellowship in Rheumarology before beginr
ning her own practice.

Thorburn ran cross country as a Pioneer under the guidr
ancc of coach Evelyn Freeman long before she had Olympic
cycling dreams. It was not until she attended Stanford that she
became involved in cycling.

“1 always rode a bike but never thought about it as some
thing you did for Competition," she said.

A knee injury that was aggravated by running along with
the encouragement ofa good friend on the Stanford cycling
team convinced her to begin riding more seriously. Thorburn
was a natural.

“1 was pretty good in 1993 despite being a clinical student
in medical school,"she said, “I wasn’t training much, and I did
well right away.“

However, Thorburn quickly recognized that she needed
more concentrated training to become a better cyclist. In 2003,
Thorburn started working with an experienced coach and com—
peted in some national caliberraces before cycling in the world
championships in Hamilton, Canada.

Racing at the international level was an "eye-opening expe-
rience,"Thorburn said.

The next year, in 2004, building company Webcor Platinum
approached Thornburn about forming a team around her with
the goal of qualifying her to the Olympics. With a small team
of talented riders under the guidance of Team Director Karen
Brems, a former World Champion in the time trials.Thorburn
won the us, National Time Trial Championships to earn a
spot on the us. Olympic Team.

Thorburn‘s fourth-place Olympic finish changed the per-
ception ofher athletic endeavors among those around her.

“I felt like doors kept opening as I had more success," she
said.

The professional world became more accommodating as
she continued to perform wcll, especially as she was completing
her postdoctoml fellowship at Stanford.

Qualifying for the Olympics gave me more time off dnrt
ing my fellowship,” she said. “I still have to be careful about the
time 1 take off, but I'm getting more time off than 1 would."

Balancing her life as a \vorldrclass athlete and a working
doctor is challenging, but Thorburn tries to stay conscious of
how her work affects her training.

“It's harder now. I'm on my feet more than[wbcn]1wus do-
ing research. It's hard to stay hydrated when talking to people
and dictating between seeing patients.”

1n a world where many professional athletes leave college
for professional sports before completing their degrees or begin
competing straight out of high school,Thorbum’s story stands
out as unusual. With a medical degree and active practice, she is
able to support herselfoutside of professional cycling.

“1 don’t know any other way," she notes when speaking
about her education and career, “because I started [cycling] at
Stanford. lr is not a sport we grew up thinking about doing.
unlike in Europe. It is something women do well into their late

30’s and 40’s, and so women tend to come to [cycling] later in
life after having gotten degrees.“

Cycling “is not a sport you're going to make money in, so
you have to take care to support yourself,"Thorburn said,

With ednc ion being an important part of Thorburrr's
life, it isn’t surprising that she remembers her time at Grinnell
fondly She decided that she wanted a well-rounded smaller
school experience that would allow her the opportunity to run
cross country.

Some of Grinnell’s quirkicr moments stand out in her
memory including a streaking club that would run through the
library on occasion. During her time at the college, the Flesh
dcutial election campaign came through campus, and she re-
calls studenrs protesting the Republican candidate.

She also remembers standing outside ofthe Forum after a

political lecture and continuing a friendly debate with other
Grinnelliuns.

I really loved my Grinnell orperience, Thorbrrrn said.
With her professional life, training and racing schedules, how

'ever, she has been unable to return to campus for any alumni

events.

Even though she hasn't been able to come to Grinnell, part
of Grinnell has come to her. At the Nanire Vallcv Grand Prix
in the Twin Cities, some ofher friends from college came out
in support for her racing.

Thorburn, originally from Davenport, 1a., encourages a
team to get started at Grinnell and for cyclists to train in small
groups to get comfortable riding With other pcoplc.“lt is a great
avenue for women just starting out," she said, “it’s friendlier.
and that way you can get your reetwer.”

Hailey Harrison of Gustavus Adolphus won the individ-
ual championship with a time of 21:37 over the sixekilornee

with a time of23:35.

The Pioneers were so dominant that Meredith Groves '08
finished 35th to earn All~Regiori honors despite not being his
eluded in Grinnell’s team score, since only the top five runners
for a team contribute to its score. Erin Sindewald ’08 also comr
pcted for Grinnell, ﬁnishing 59th out ofover 150 iunners.

“Winning by such a huge margin was a shock," Louthan
sald.“lt was emotional/a lot ofpeople cried."

The biggest challenge for the Pioneers this week may siinr
ply be hoping to hit Nationals on a good day for the top runs

“Results depend on who's on and who’s off," Freeman said.
“I believe our women will rim another good race and I'm sure
we'll be pleased with the iesult, whatever that happens to be."

The team seems to share Freeman’s ielaxetl, confident

mindset. “We've turned quite a few heads this season," Spent
