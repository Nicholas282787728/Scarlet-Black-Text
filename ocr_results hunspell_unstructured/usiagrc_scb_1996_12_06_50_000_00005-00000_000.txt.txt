Legalize!

BY BEN PATRICK
Columnist

Well, it seems ﬁtting that the last opinion
I‘m likely to offer to you this semester is on a
topic of such relevance. Certainly, there are
few political issues that hit so close to home
here in Grinnell, not’bccause we are a college
ﬁlled with drug addicts, but rather because, in
my opinion, the students here are always ready
to challenge the beliefs and policies ofthe sta-
tus quo. Similarly, my opinion of Grinnell
College students is that, despite popular opin-
ion outside of Grinnell, they are very prag-
matic and realisticinot constrained by popu-
lar opinion or taboos. Therefore, I think that
your average Grinnell College student is very
likely to be in favor ofthe legalization ofdrugs.

Now, this debate is, by now, a very well»
worn one, and I’m certain many of you are
familiar with the common arguments both for
and against the legalization of drugs, Thus,
I’m not going to give you the same tired, well-
rehearsed arguments you've heard a thousand
times before. Ifyou want that, look in David's
article. Instead, I want to offer you a very
simple, common sense reason or two for lie
galizing drugs.

At the top of this list of common-
sense reasons is a simple fact: we need
to revise our policy towards the use
and sale ofillicit drugs. The “War On
Drugs" has been a dismal failure, be
ginning to end. David might cite
some impressive facts about how
many kilos of drugs we’ve appre-
hended, how many dealers we‘ve are
rested, and so on, but current trends and come
mon logic proves that our “victories" are drops
in the bucket. We must also learn from the
past, Only one country in history has success-
fully ended widespread drug addiction by its
citizens: China, with its opium problem. And
they used methods I doubt the American pub
lic would support (basically, anyone found
anywhere near any amount of opium was
killed). Therefore, we have proven two things:
ﬁrst, the current American policy on illegal
drugs is failing, and second. we have no rea
son to believe anything can be done to make
our current policy work. 1

Now, I should explain why legalization is
our best alternative, First, legalization will
allow us to provide a safer atmosphere for drug
use. By limiting the use of drugs ,to
Amsterdam-style “drug bars" and other clean
environments, we can reduce the risk of over-
doses, and lower the risk of getting AIDS.
Why would this not be good? Second, legal-
ization would lead to radically lower prices,
This would prevent much ofthe crime associ-
ated with drug use (current ﬁgures mark 75%
of all violent crime as “directly attributable"
to drug use).

Additionally, we can tax these drugs much
like we tax alcohol and cigarettes now. Why
would this not be good? But perhaps the best
reason is embodied in the arguments of the
Yale professor who noted that illegalizzttion

of any substance creates a demand for more
concentrated and Iesssafe forms of said sub

stance.

Take alcohol during Prohibition. When ale
coho] was made illegal, most alcohol cone
sumed in the U.S. was in the form of beer.
But, during Prohibition, the alcohol consulned
was now primarily whiskey or moonshine,
both more dangerous and more potent than
beer. The same is true for drugs, Crack is not
a “drug of choice." it is a “drug of no choice."
Crack is highlyrconcentratcd, and is thus easy
to transpon and conceal, which makes it popuc
lar. If we legalize drugs, then, we could ex
pect to see a radical decrease in the use of
highlyrconcentraicd drugs like crack, and an
increase in the use of mild drugs, like mari-
juanzi. Why would this not be good?

By way of conclusion, let me note that I
think this issue clearly deﬁnes the differences
between liberals and conservatives, in my
opinion, Liberals are always ready to try
something new if it holds promise. Conser-
vatives hate to see the status quo get changed.
Liberals form opinions and positions based on
logic and evidence; conservatives, based on
morality and personal belief. Additionally, we
liberals suffer a lot because we're never afraid
to admit we sometimes don‘t know how to
solve a particular problem. When confronted
with an issue as complex as drug legalization,
weliberals aren’t afraid to admit that there are
any number of things that might solve the
problem, but we’re not certain which one will
work best. This, to me, is simple honesty. We
will admit that there are no perfect answers
This is, after all, no utopia we live in, Drug
legalization might lead to higher addiction lev-
els, more deaths, etc. But we’re certain that
the current policy isn’t working.

This week's topic is drug legalization
This is where my true, Libertarian nature
comes out to surprise those who only know
me marginally well.

As a personal champion ofpersonal free
dom, I find it opprobnous thatcertain things
are illegal. The group of laws concerning
the illegalizatlon of drugs are rather firmly

. ensconced in this list,

As a complete idealist (can there truly be
any other kind?) I see this as yet another
instance of the government stepping in to
decide what a person can and cannot do with
his own property. The major difference is
that those deemed “conservative" are the
major advocates for this overstepping of
governmental authority in this instance. The
idealistic reason for there not to be laws pro-
hibiting drug use by adults is simply that a
person's use of drugs in no way directly
transgresses another man's freedom. Sure,
it’s simple, but simplicity generally gives
more credence towards veracity than other
wise.

Now that] have ﬁnished speaking to the

It is a slow movement,
but I have not yet lost
hope.

ten or so other idealists left in the world, I
suppose it is my duty to provide pragmatic
reasons advocating the abolishment of this
blight on personal freedom.

There are several beneﬁcial effects of le-
galization, quite possibly the most impore
tant of which is the accompanying drop in
street price. This in and of itself may not
sound important, but the lessening ofcrimi»
ttal behavior fueled by those attempting to
purloin valuables speciﬁcally to purchase
dnigs is of extreme importance, Many more
thefts, burglaries, and murders (crimes most
people care about) occur due to persons'
looking for funds with which to procure
drugs than are caused by people due to their
being under the inﬂuence ofthese drugs.

Along with this drop in crime, we get two
financial windfalls. First, we will spend less
attempting to Win a war we have been fight-
ing in the wrong way, and secondly. we have
the billions in tax revenue that would be cre-
ated overnight. Some may think it wrong
to tax a product that ls addictive, but this
tax acts as an anti»suasive against unsalulary
acts.

Some would argue that drugs are simply
too dangerous, and must be contained. TV
has caused more rotting of the average
child’s intellect than drugs have a hope of
doing. Laws that remove responsibility
from those who should be bearing it have
caused more destruction to our cultural fab-
ric then drugs ever have. Yes, these are not
reasons defending drugs, but rather they
show that several are talking out of both
sides of their mouths. Also, it isn't even
clear that long term drug use will increase
substantially with the legalization of drugs,
as the proﬁt motive will be destroyed for
those who are in the business of getting
people hooked.

But while we are on the subject of the
ill effects of drugs, how about we rectify a
few other problems concerning controlled
substances. My view requires great amounts
of personal responsibility, the one true req-
uisite for stable freedom. Once again, we
cannot continue to transfer responsibility
away from where it rightly belongs. Under
a system oflegal drugs, which is predicated
upon the idea that abusing drugs does not
transgress on nnother's rights, the culpabil»
ity of abusers who conlmit crimes while
under the ilifluences must be set squarely
upon the shoulders of the abuser. With this
in mind, I advocate the amending of con-
temporary Jurisprudence to consider an
abuser’s crimes while under the inﬂuence
ofdrugs to be premeditated. That is, ifyou
kill someone while high, the court should
act as though you meant to do it from the
start. Sure, it seems pretty draconian, but it
is the only way to safcguard the sanctity of
the possessions and lives of the citizens.

I know it is a slow movement, but I have
not yet lost hope. Possibly I may live to see
a day in America where people can do what
they please with what they have without
threat ofinearcerzttion or sanction. This will
take massive amounts ofpersona] responsi-
bility, a trait that current trends seem to show
moribund.

Well, this is it. The last hurrah before break arrives, the se-
mester ends, and we head home (or elsewhere) for a month. Pei-
sonally, I’m excited to hezid home, and will once again be
tollboothing. Chances are I'll have a story or two to tell you
when I return for the second semester about this winter‘s
tollboothing experience

But before break, we’ll have the pleasure oftaktng ﬁnals. Since
I‘ve been back from Thanksgivtng break, I‘ve been more stressed
out than any other time this year. I perceive that something's
wrong when I ﬁnd myself shaking with alertness and I‘m not
even on Vivarin However, I’m not going to rattle off a list of
grievances, or waste your lime whining with end-of-lhe-semester
anxiety. In fact, I’m not even going to discuss ﬁnals or anything
like that. Let me tell you about something much more valuable.

I came back from Thanksgiving break on Sunday afternoon,
for the most part replenished from the fourrday vacation, Be-
longings gathered in my arms, I walked up the stairs of my hall,
welcoming myself back “home," I reached the top floor, and
eringed in disgust.

Before my eyes was our floor Can- Can. The large gray bucket
ofempty cans was exiled from the floor weeks ago when it reached
its full capacity but what was it still doing in an oversalurated
state? Weeks ago, part ofthe reason the Caanan was originally
banished was due to the birth of dozens of fruit ﬂies.

Cautiously, I approached the overﬂowing Caanan, ready to
run for cover. Gently, I tapped the large bin with the toe of my
left foot. Suddenly, a huge swarm of fruit flies rose out of the
Caanan in a black cloud. The cloud hovered in the air for ahalf—i
second, and I fell back. Then, the black cloud of fmlt ﬂies sprang
forward and bolted towards me like lightning. I could hear them
buzzing and licking their lips, hungry for me. Ilunged for the
door. Tossing my bags inside the hallway, I leapt into the hall
and slammed the door behind me. I looked out the window, where
some of the flies I had just avoided cursed the glass.

I let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, something beyond human
comprehension was on my side, and helped me avoid the hateful
mass of fruit ﬂies. Regathering myself, I toted my bags into my
room. As I walked down the hall, I noticed that the trash can was
metamorphosing, too. Luckily, it was at an earlier stage. Appar-
ently these fruit ﬂies weren‘t too angry yet. They still flew mere
rily, searching amongst dripping pints of liquid Ben and Jerry’s
ice cream. salty deposits in otherwise empty Doritos pouches,
and conglomerations of other waste generated by people in their
respective rooms.

It seemed our SA, our protector, had abandoned us long ago.
Before break began, he chose to desert the overflowing Can-Can
and wait until after break to empty it. Now we were left to face
an entourage of angry fruit flies, 2i hall rug corroded with dirt,

rooms.

Or, more appropriately. Ug, the bathrooms.

the looks of things, Id need a full armor suit to be able to utilize the .
bathrooms for any future means. One sink overflowed with leftovers,

of a haircut given two weeks back, and was also spotted with grimy,
globs of toothpaste and red stains of who-knowswhat. I won‘t even-V.

mention the toilets.

Certainly, we couldn t reside in such ﬁlth for another three week

With our SA ridding himself of the matter, and us locked out of the a
custodial closet, what were we to do? Well, folks, let me tell you Somer‘, 7
thing. We were saved by one woman. A woman whose powers breach

those of any ordinary human being, Our cleaning lady, JoAnn, was);

that savior.

After having spent Sunday night shuddering in my sleep at t
thoughts of what was cocooning in various places on our floor, aims;
having practically suffocated due to the rank smells of the bathroom}:
that morning, I returned from class Monday afternoon to the sweet sine

Once again, loAnn had performed one of her miracles. Only the Catt-e:

like to ask all of you to extend your thanks and well wishes to the people 5

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Dear Editors,

Although I zim currently studying off
campus this semester, I have been receivtng
both the Scarlet and Black and The Gum,
and have paid close attention to the contro-
versy surrounding page nine ofthe fall issue
of The Gum (which, by the way, is correctly
written The Gum, not the GUM, the Gum or
the Gum).

The Gum has had and should have the
most open format of any Grinnell College
student publication. This does not mean it
should have no standards. The issue at hand
is not freedom of speech, it is abuse of power.
As students, Dan Buettner and Marcus
Moran have the right to call the ASIA group
“asinine” and “ludicrous” iftltey so choose.
As editors of The Grim. they do not. Their
excuse that the “ad“ was not intended to be
racist is a bullshitexcusc. Intent has nothing
to do with meaning and it is naive to assume
that the intent of anything published in zlny
public magazine will be clear to anyone. The
“ad" is racist. This cannot be disputed. It uses
a photograph ofmembers ofASlA staging a
protest to raise awareness about their
struggles as minority students, then blanks
out the banner, suggesting that any cause is
as “aslnine,” in Buettner‘s words, as ASIA's,

As a former editor of The Guru, I felt that
the publication’s unique open format should
be put to use trying to advance causes,
Buettner and Moran apparently feel The Grim
should be used to bring them down. To be
an editor of a Grinnell College publication
means you have been selected to a position
of power by SPARC, the campus media
branch of SGA, the student body governs
ment. When an editor uses this power to be
little the struggles of minorities Ell Grinnell
College, this is abuse of power and should
not be ioleratcd. The photograph used in the
“ad” shows AS lA's protest of last spring,

meant to bring attention to the lack ofspace
and facilities provided for them by Grinnell
College. Student media faces similar prob—
lems, I seem to remember reading a letter
sent to the administration around the same
time as the ASIA protest. The letter, which
Buettner signed, regarded the inadequate fa-
cilities for student publications. How
Buettner can face some of the same prob-
lems as ASIA, and yet belittle their efforts is
beycr'id me, And for. the administration to
ever give more money and space to campus
media after seeing the racist material printed
in The Gum would be nothing short of a
miracle, As the governing body of campus
media, it is in SPARC‘s best interest to side
with ASIA and demand the resignations of
Buettner and Moran.

To the campus and community,

I would like tlle opportunity to respond to
Adam Wirtzfeld’s assertions concerning the
Scarlet arid Black budget. In our last issue,
without the editors‘ knowledge, Wirtzfeld
expressed his frustration at not being paid
for his cartoon work. Publishing a break-
down of the newspaper‘s budget, Wirtzfeld
implied that the two editors in chief were si-
phoning almost $5000 into their own sala—
ries or some other unknown fund.

Ifch that Wirtzfeld's cartoon was an exe
tremely irresponsible and immature use of
the newspaper for his own purposes By
publishing his “interpretation” of the Scar-
Ic! and Black budget, Wirtzfeld’s loosely
based and angry assertions affected a huge
number of people, both readers and writers,
It was embarrassing and discrediting to eve
eryonc involved with the paper, ralhcr than
achieving the personal vengcance I suspect
Wirtzfeld desired,

Wirtzfeld implicated the entire staff as tak‘- l ‘

not like the fact that Wirtzfeld published in

about the context of deception in which
Wirtzfeld suggested I garner my dollar an;
