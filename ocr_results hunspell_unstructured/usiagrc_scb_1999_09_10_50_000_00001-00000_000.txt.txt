When John D. Srone came so crinnell in 1933, he said,

and philosophy, did so by founding she Exotic Programming Languages Srudy Group. or
EPLSG.

Since spring semesser of 1934, srudenrs in she group have been able ro learn compurere
programming languages nor offered in ofﬁcial college courses. Languages have ranged from
rhe common, such as Java and Co, so she more obscure, such as SNOBOL, whose name is a
rakeoffon rhe old COBOL language.

SNOBOL has, according ro Srone, “a number of idiosyncraric features," which require

helps srudenrs develop “knowledge and appreciarion ofsome osherwrse unfamiliar program—

Whllc some of rhe languages srudied have been fairly obscure, srone said some gradnares
have found rheir EPLSG knowledge useful in she .ob marker.

one alumnus, for example. learned a language called Common Lisp in she sriirly group
and rhen wenr ro work developing rools for video game manufacsurers using rhar language.

Laura Allender Ferguson ’39, who graduased from Grinncll wirh a major in marhemarics,
srill remembers raking parr in srone's group, “The combinarion ofrhe courses we snokand she
srudy group made my educarion in compurcr science much broader rhan is would orherwise
have been," she said.

She said she srill remembers learning APL, a hardcracrczld language where every characrer
on she keyboard has a discrere meaning. “is was almosr like learning a cipher," forguson rec
called.

“He really gave us a sense of empowermenr,“ she said of Slonc. “He helped us learn she
meraelanguage behind programming languages."Thc lesson, she said, is shar you dour have so
rake a class in order so learn a language. if you have she. kind of background provided by
EPLsc, you can juss pick up a manual and learn it.

“It’s a fun acriviry," said Ferguson, now a sofrware developer in Chicago. “He really appree
ciases languages."

Andrew l<ensler ’01 ssarred parriciparing in she srudy group rhis year. “l’m rrying so learn
as many languages as l can," he said, “lr's iiisr somerhing ofa personal goal.” since she EPLSG

is a good choice for srudenrs like Kensler, who wanr ro expand rheir linguisric capabilisies.

Srone, Kensler said, is very knowledgeable. “He's a person you can rrusr so know who he's

The srudy group has had an impacr on orinnelis composer science curriculum as well,

be a good replacemenr for pascal as she seconddevel compurer science course. This semesrer,
