Thinking
Twice

Ben Johannsen engages in
exploration of economics,
philosophy and the links

This past Sunday, before an audience of his
family, the Philosophy faculty, and senior Philos-
ophy majors, Ben Johannsen received Grinnell's
inagural Worley prize, a new award for the most
outstanding Philosophy major, named for Prue
fessor John H, Worley.

)ohannsen isn’t just a Philosophy major. He
double majors in Philosophy and Economies.
"two majors that seemingly have nothing to do
with each other," He’s grateful he was able to
pursue such bipolar intellectualism at Grinnell.

To johannsen, however, Philosophy and Econ
nomics actually do relate. While at Grinnell,
Johnannsen has devoted himself to studying the
intersections between these two areas of thought,
which he feels are too often neglected.

“Many disciplines have a lot to learn from
many other disciplines, and these two specifically
are often ignored by each other,’I he said. “I feel
that there’s enough that is ignored that is impor‘
tant that it needs to be examined, challenged,
considered, reconsidered."

Johannsen believes that the power of coca
nomics could be better wielded if economists
more fully understood the contributions of phlr
losophy to economic principles.

“Basic philosophy about the role of govern
ment, the unfettered market, even the faith in the
downwardesloping demand curve: these things
are ideologically arrived at. oftentimes, econo-
mists neglect eruly considering what’s being done
as they’re conducting that work," he said.

Recently, he’s expressed this interest in inter-
section through his Philosophy senior thesis, on
“Critical Theory in Keynesian Capitalism," and
his Economies MAP with Professor Bateman,
which foeused on the inﬂuence of philosophie
thought on monetar‘ism in the carly1980s.

Raised in Muscatine, lowaA Johannsen has
lived in Iowa all his life and wanted to leave the
state for college. For better or worse, however, he
"found that there was a lot at Grinnell that wasn't
like anything 1 had expo-
rienecd growing up."

After graduation he’s
planning to vacation in
England and Ireland,
and afterwards will head
to Washington, DC. to
work for the Federal Reserve, an opportunity to
use his ideas about applying philosophy to econ
nomics.

Johannsen has obtained a two-year position
working as a research assistant in the division of
Monetary Affairs, where he’ll aid economists in
their research and help compose the “blue book"

fondest memories of his
Glinncll experience. “Golf is in some ways a re»

“It's different from school in so many ways.
The rigors of Grinncll are in some ways coun-

really grateful that] had that opportunity."
