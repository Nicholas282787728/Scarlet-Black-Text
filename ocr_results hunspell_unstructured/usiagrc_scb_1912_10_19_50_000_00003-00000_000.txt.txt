Arnold, at hall-back tor the Fresh-
men, is one oi the rastest men on the
ﬁeld. He is said lo have a retard oi
10 ﬂat in ille centuri- dash.

El en with Carter and Lingenielter,
two oi their best men, out oi the line-
up, the Freshmen proved more than a
hand-iull [or the Varsity, and the ﬁrst
team men were forced to extend [hem-
selves to the limit to gain even the
semblance or a score,

“PM." Witters did some great work
~at end on the second team, He is
one oi the best tacklers ward Field has
seen in a long time.

“ulna" Frey is in Very poor physical
condi on, and may not be alile to gel:
into the game ior several weeks.

All we need now is a pair at tackles,
a half-back or two, and an end. With
these, we might stand a our chance at
winning ii-oin Amos next Saturday.
This is not intended as a "knock,” but
ii it puts a little [right into some at
the men, this ink will not hare been
wasted.

however, Arnold has ﬁlled the position

_ very acceptably.
