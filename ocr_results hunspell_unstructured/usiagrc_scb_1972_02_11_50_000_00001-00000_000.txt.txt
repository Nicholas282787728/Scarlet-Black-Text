 

The Grinnell
Scarlet and Black Wampum

Members of the Conceined Black
Students (CBS), two libiaiiaiis and
Dean Walker met yesterday in Bur-
Iing to discuss the Black library.

The Black library, a grouping of
books from the African/Alma
American Studies books in the lie
brary’s regular collection, was es-
tablished as part ol the agreement
after CBS occupied Burling library

, lar one morning last semester and
.presented the college with a list
of ten demands.

As it now exists, the Black lib-
rary is some fifty books and bib-
liographies on three shelves Just
inside and to the right of the front
entrance to Burling library,

CBS members asked for the
meeting with the library staff and
Mr, Walker because, according to
Russell McGregor oi CBS, they are
“very disappointed with the Black
library as it is now . . . which is
nine cubic feet of shelf space with
some thirty odd books on the
shelves."

The oroginal idea for the Black
library, Mcoregor said, was of “a
room, a separate collection oi all
books and literature regarding black
life." It would be a collection com-
parable to the Twentieth Century
Room and the Gl‘innell Room.

No decision to expand the Black Iii
brary was made at the meeting yes,
terday afternoon, which was also air
tended by African and Afro-Ameri-
can Studies program chairman Vire
ginius Thornton, student Coordina-
tor Bob Meyer, and tour white stu-
dents invited by Russell MC Gre-
gor,

Henry Alden, head librarian, told
the 5513 that the library staff had
fulfilled the agreement of last
semester which stipulated that ”the
most important and current books in
(the African and Afro-American Stu-
dies) colleclion would be kept in an
open reserve section or the library."
In an interview with the SBLB Wed-

Schwen

by Terry Wall and Curt Gorrell

Congressman Fred Schwengel, Re-
publican representative from Iowa's
lst Congressional District, spokedt
a PPPE-sponsored gathering in the
South Lounge Thursday alternoon
and surprised a small but attentive
group or students and laculty with
his outspoken views on issues rang
ing lrom J. Edgar Hoover to Vietr
nam.

In his introductory remarks, Rep.
Schwengei Called the Vietnam cone
flict "one of the most tragic d9,
velopments in the history of my
country. ll this teaches us nothing
else it will forever remind us that
you cannot solve problems that are
political, social, and economic W
like Vietnam -- with a gun."

Congressman Schwengel had called
on the President to withdraw all
troops and terminate all military
activity, including bombing, by Jan»
uary 1972, and has now supported
similar measures to end American
military involvement by June 1,
1972.

While in favor of an end to Ameri-
can military involvement, Rep. Schr
wengel, who has twice made trips
to Vietnam, expressed a unique
view on postrwar policy. Schwengel
said he was ashamed of the failure
of his church (Baptist) to live up
to its reponslbility and that he
would support and/or lead a Na
tional Council of Churches fund drive
to “go to Vietnam and help them
rebuild their temples, rarestabllsh
their oWn Culture and help themimr
prove it. That's one of the best
delenses against Communism be
cause Communism and Buddhism
would never live together.”

On the question ol amnesty, Rep.
Schwengel cited past precedent and

nesday, Russell McGregor and Mr.
Thornton outlined their proposal for
the Black library, hich was or

lered in rough term to the library
staff and Mr. Walker yesterday,

They would like to gather all the
library’s holdings in the black slur
dies area and put them in one loca-
tion in the basement olthe library--
probably the area including and near
the present Offices of Deans Wall
and Walker (which will be moved
to White house soon).

”We feel that the black artifacts
which we do have here: books,
magazines, periodicals, pictures,
and other tiems should be displayr
ed properly,and made available to
all students,” Thornton said.

He felt that this might “attract
manuscripts and rare newspapers
from various parts of the black
world to Grinnell . . . Students Who
are doing specialized research into
black community actioo could be
persuaded to deposit their research
findings in the Black library."

Thornton explained that different
rooms in the present ollice areas
can be used to house the different
collections of Black studies books
now in the library 7- periodicals,
African materials, and Afror
American materials, ior example.

Larger open areas can be used lor
display, and smaller private rooms
could be used for listening to mate-
rials recorded oh records and tape,
and tar viewing slides or micro-
film.

Costs may be an important con-
sideration in whether or not the Cole
lege undertakes this proposed re-
organization and expansion at the
or

Audiurvlsual material would have
to be acquired, and there would be a
substantial expense even to recatar
loging the books which would go into
the Black library, according to Mr.
Alden.

Further meetins are being planned.

a plan, similarto that DfSenator Taft

country in order to avoid military
service, would, upon their return,

type oi activity for a year or two."
In an interview, the $3113 asked
Schwengel how his constituents _,
generally regarded as conservative
“Bible belters" -- felt about his
open—minded views on Vietnam and
China policy. The Congressman
claimed that talking about Vietnam
to his hawkish constituents changed
many minds. And on China he

billion worth of grain over there to
help them with their starvation, you

attitude” Of course they will,"
Earlier in the day, Schwengel had
made public his intention to seek
rerelection for a ninth term as
representative of the southeastern
Iowa lst district, which, through
re—opportionment, will include Ben-
ton and Poweshiek counties in the
1972 elections. Early in the dues
tionranswer session, Schwengel rer
sponded to charges (of possible
Democratic opponent Ed Mez-
vlnsky), that he was abusing the
iranking privilege. Schwengel said
that, upon request, he had indeed
mailed newsletters to residents of
Poweslliek and Benton counties, even
though those counties were not now
in his district The Congressman
explained that this was common
practice ,, “Culver's doing the
same thing“ 77 and that the con-
tents nf the mailing were “absolute-
ly nonrpartisan.”

In the field of domestic politics.
while he acknowledged that Sen.

Muskie is the irontrunner for the
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion, Rep, Schwengel lelt that Sena-
tor Humphrey would be the most
ditticult candidate [or Nixon to beat.
Asked if he believed that Vice-
President Agnew would hurt the Re-
publican ticket in Iowa, Schwengel
replied irankly H . Yes,
especially in the lst district . . .

was equally candid about 77 year
old J. Edgar hoover» “l have said
and l have sent word back to J._
Edgar himseli that he ought to
voluntarily resign and make it easy
on the President.”

Rep. Schwengel, whose district is

comprised oi a large number oi
larming iamilies, said that his con-
stituents at lirst had been opposed
to the appointment at Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz, who has been
criticized lor his links to corporate
farming, or agribusiness, interests.
But, said Schwengel, “he’s not ree
sponding like Democrats said. He's
doing more lor small tarmers than
any man we've had . . lgota
request lor Eutz to be the 4th ol
July speaker in Mt. Pleasant, ol all
things.”

Congressman Schwengel to be quite

that his Option olA»B-C/erase would
replace the present credit/fail sys
tem, and not be used in addition to
it. A student could elect one course
on a credit/erase basis, which could
not be in his mayor tield.

Mr. Morris proposes an A, A7, E,

words, no student would ever re-
celve a C; he would receiveacredit

Culver Quits
Senate Race

will Seek
Re-election

In a move that shocked Iowa Demo-

crats and surprised political ana-
lysts across the state, Congressman
John Culver announced Wednesday
that he would not Seek the U. S.
Senate seat held by two~term in-
cumoent Jack Miller. Culver, who
spoke at Grinnell last September,
made the announcement in a press
release to his 2nd District consti-
tuents, saying that had decided inv
stead to run for a fifth term in the
House of Representatives.

almost everyone had been expect-
ing Culver to launch his official
campaign later this month. He has
been ”testing the waters” through-
out the state since early last sum,
mer and most reporters considered
his candidacy a very iormidable
challenge to Senator Miller. The
sides were lining up lor one of the
lew Senate races in the country
where a liberal Democrat was op-
posing a conservative Republican.

in his announcement Culver gave
no indication why he decided to
iorego the state—wide campaign. All
indications were that the Culver
stall was gearing up tor a very
strong and well-organized eiiort.
Speculation is that Culver found it
difficult to leave his 2nd district

Congressional seat for which he is
aImost assured reelection. In a
telephone interview with the 5515,
a Culver staff member Said that
healing Jack Miller would take “a
Herculean effort”, but that the or-
ganization had been very optimistic
about chances for victory. The Con-
gressman’s stail was disappointed
by the decision which they said was
made privately by the Congressman
in the past several days. Because
almost all Democrats expected Cul»
ver to run, the decision presently
leaves the party without a candidate
for the Senate and probably assures
Senator Miller another six-year
term.

Among those now being considered
as possible candidates for the Demo-
cratic nomination for the Senate are
Richard Clark, former administra-
tlve assistant to Culver; William
Gannon, former minority leader in
the Iowa House; and Nicholas John-
son, Federal Communications Com—
missioner whose term expires next
year.

Back When I Knew Him...

Phi Alpha Delta, an honorary legal
fraternity of the Duke University
School cl Law, may be luckier than
it thinks. Not only does it listamong
its associates a former Duke law
student by the name of Richard M.
Nixon, but also William S. Vandere
ipool, in, Professor and chairman
of the Department of Communica-
tions here.

Nixon attended Duke’s law school
before World War II, about seven
years beiore Vanderpool, but Van—
derpool remembers well the time
Nixon returned to Duke in '47 or
'48 to give a speech before the
fraternity to which they both be
longed.

Subversion and Socializing

“He was a Congressman at that
time," Vanderpool recalls, “and
this was the heyday point at the
concern over the Communist party.
llis speech was about Communist
subversion in the United States.”
Vanderpool was at that time Vice
