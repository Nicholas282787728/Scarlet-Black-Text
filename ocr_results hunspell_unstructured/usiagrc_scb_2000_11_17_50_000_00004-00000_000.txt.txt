like most people at
Grinnell, I want to care
about something. I
tried caring about
school, but that
stopped working out
around Last week. '

I considered joining
some sort of activist
group so that 1 could
care about old growth
wood or countries with
funny names or why it
is bad that my
Sweatshirt was made in
the aforementioned
countries. However, the
meetings for these
groups generally
occurred during my nap
time. I needed
something that took
less time, something
that I didn't have to
(are that much about.

So I Conside d
getling a signi cant
other. And although
boyrriends and nap
times tan coexist,
signiﬁcant others come
with a host of other
problems. For inslance,
you have to pretend
like you are listening to
everything they say.
Also, it you have a
signiﬁcant other,
everyone hates you.
Yes, including the
signiﬁcant other,

Then 1 thoughtI
needed something
quieter, something
smaller, and something
that would not argue
when I asked it to wear
a collar. 1 would adopt
and care for a pet!
started hanging out
with the orange cat
that lives near hurling
What I learned is that
cats can pretty much
take care of themselves.
I needed something
helpless, lost and
confused.

1 found a stray
prospie that same day.
He was on Haiiies Third
and he was looking for
Norris. Prospies, unlike
cats, can’t find their
own rood, can't protect
themselves against
squirrels, and can't
derecare in designated
areas. I could care
about the poor boy.
Unfortunately, he was
pretty boring. I brought
him to central campus,
pushed him away from
my side and said, "Go!
Go! Vou are free now!"
He looked more
confused than usual
and wandered off to
Carleton.

1 needed something
less time-consuming
than a cause,
something quieter than
a boyfriend, something
more needy than a cat,
and something more
interesting than a
prosie. So 1 got a plant

A: My brorlicralso

this, I can admit my fault; and I will, whenever they

Scary Movie

F: The Gcnm spoorMovie is a genre itself, with
noble roars (Bkzmg Saddles, AirpbrmU and a check

A: Again, Fred lays the generalities on
you, whilc'l spout particulars about the him
in question. Everyone knows the Shawn

Keenan ivory and Damon. And yet, ihey
keep trying. This spoofs ﬁlms (like the

Saving Gmrz

F: OK, neither of as has seen

fellow Rimlin'l'est Squaddcr, Shana
Barchas, who raved abaur ihn one.
She said: “saving Grace ralces place in a little Irish
fishing town. i . craca, a wealthy homemaker and
avid gardener in her sixties, is threatened with losing

probably also recommend you stick around Harris
