Allrhassildor Horiglltou's speech at
the File 'ui Dinner, London, has made
a had irnprcssron on Europe, particu-
larly on France. ilr. lloughton laid
down the propos tion that the contirr
nation of American financial aid to
Europe would depend upon the evir
deuce of the intention of Europe to
maintain peace and to strive for a re-
llil'th. 0n the surface this looks like
sound, wholesome advice, hut let rrs
look at it through European eyes.
Europeans point out that these loans
are made to Europe on extremely inr
\‘itiiig terms (as high as nine pcr
cent) and that the lrrrrrrnctions are
not wholly unselfish on Americas
part. iloreover, hefcro and litter the
Cixll il'ar, during the period of rain
road construction. Eur-ope (especially
England) loaned, immensc sums to
America tor its development. 0n the
matter of Dencu, Europe wonders why
America. should be so sell-righteorm
wiry we should adopt the "llolierr
thdlrrtliou” attitude. They wonder
why we do not take the mote out or
our own eves before asking them to
take the herun out of theirs. They
point out that we preach peace and
at the srrnrc time send an immense
war fleet to Australia and the Philip
pines, to the great indignation of Ja-
pan, Also. that we have dcenlr
wounded .lapan (unnecessarily) in
our method of excluding the Japanese
from the United states. They remem-
her, too, that we refused to rein the
Leaguc of Nations (the most effective
agency for peace in the norm) and do
not even cooperate with it re near-c
ily. They remind rrs that \\e put up
a high tariff \\'frl|~\lneccesaril_\'

ican llrhor~lhus prolnhrtrng Euro-
penu goods from entering Amer-r a

they are alarmed and made suspicious
in the plan to make Defense Day an
annual affair. They point out, too,
that the United States is regarded
with almost as mrrch rear and suspic-
ion hy Central and South American
countries as are the European coun-
tries hy each other. All these facts
make them wonder about American
consistency and even her good faith.

America must iearll that peace can
only come through (lo—operation, that
it is as much our obligation as it is
Europe's. We cannot withdraw from
world affairs without disaster to our
selves, even if we would. Any large
war in Europe means unr- for us.
This has been proved. Isolation is
impossi le, our only safe policy is to
help Europe by acts as well as words.
The Dawes Plan, [or eV'imple, is do-
ing vastly rrrore than \ 11 any amount
of good advice which we ourselves do
not follow. Advice which, under the
circumstances, Europe (with some
reason) reg s as gratuitous.

The bad ciiects of this speech are
particularly noticeable in France.
France justly feels that her conduct
of the last year has been a generous
and peaceful one, and now she feels
that America still con dcrs her mili-
tarrstic. Her indignation is hoth deep
and widespread.

Tire election of General Hindenhurg
has not had the bad effects in France
that were feared. The recent munici-
pal elections show that the Liberal
group (the present ministry) has made
distinct gains. The prospect of a rer
trlrn ot Poincare and Miller-and is less
likely therefore than was at fir-st
feared. The return ot Poincare and
Miller-and would mean a more intense
national policy and less disposition to
conciliation. The French are to be
congratulated on their poise and good
sense. Encouraging too was the vote
of the French university students in
favor of admitting the German stur
dents to the International Federation
ol‘ Students. This is one more sign
that nations are forgetting the hatreds
or" the war and heginning to work to«
getllcr.

The election of Hindenhurg by 21.
very small majority is largely due to
the attitude OI the Allies~their tulle
uro to evacuate the Cologne :ll'en.
Since 1918 public Opinion in Germany
has been divided. The Republicans
have maintained that cooperation \\ith
the rest of Europe would result in it
square deal for Germany. The Na—
tiollalists on the other hand have
preached obstruction. The Allies have
unfortunately strengthened the Na—
tiollilli. and math: moderate Germans
loul: foolish by refusing to evacuate
the Cologne area. This was all the
more unwise since Germany had ac»
ccptcd and was royally carrying out
the Dawes Plan. Thc excuse ofrercd

has that Germany had not disarmcd
fast enough, but as the Manchester
Guardian points out, no onc took t
charge so ously, and the British For-
eign of co did not even draw up spe-
cific charges.

in the long run, the future or Eur-
ope depends on whether Germany \ ll
abandon the Honenzollern traditions
and accept those of democracy and in-
ternational cooperation. if she adopts
the latter, a new Europe will develop
in which peace and a United States of
Europe will he possible. it sire does
not, we will go back to the old Bal-
ance or Power in Europe with a war-
every fifteen or twenty or twentyJive
years. The future of peace, therefore,
depends on whether Germany can be
won for democracy in the next twcur
ty or twentyrfive year-s. whether that
can he done not only depends upon
the wisdom and good sense of the Ger~
mans themselves but also upon the
wisdom and the justice with which
Germany is treated hy the Allies.‘

Dean Inge's (Saint Paul's Cathedral,
London) visit to the United States has
aroused great interest. He is proh-

 

ahly the best known ecclesiastic in
England, certainly ho is one of the
greatest intellectual forces there. Two
or his pronouncements are of particu—
ldr interest: “In 1918,” he
"there was a yer-v real fear shared by
the golerlimellts ol' Eur-ope that the
wru- might he followed by a general
break-up of the social order. As I see
it, the danger is nearly passed.” This
new confidence on the part of the
Dean is due partly to conditions he
finds existing in the United States—
the erect diffusion of wealth behind
which, sustaining and guaranteeing it,
is the spirit of democracy, The Dean
is also quoted as liming said that “the
future of religion rests upon the dos
ceptance and aid or scientific study
and experience as applied to spiritual
things.” We call this to the attention
of Mr. Wm. J. B n!
