New Era for Youth

By Howard B. Horn

 

turning point in American politics. One of the changes that

occurred on that sunny winter day was detn'mcntal to neither
the Democrats nor the Republicans. The change marked the coming of
ageia new voice for a group of people Ihztt had long been \vllhout
tnuch voice in Washington, especially since the late 1960’s. And
Washington was all abuzz about it. The youth had arrived.

It was all inauguration commentators Bryant Gumbel and Dan
Rather could talk abouL Of the almost one dozen official inaugural
balls in Washington on January 20, the one that captured the interest
of these experienced newscasters
was not the New England Ball. Lhe
CalifomiaBaIl. or even tlte Arkanr
sas Ball. Instead. they wereexcited
about the MTV Inaugural Ball. a
ball to commemorate the record

number of voters in the 18-24 age MTV sent a mes-
bracket. Voters just like you.

MTV had been encouraging _

through their “Choose or Lose" States in gene rat .
news segments and their“Rockthe

Vote" public service announcements. Its efforts helped bring out
voters age 18-2A in record numbers. By Inauguration Day. it was time
to celebrate their efforts.

The MTV Inaugural Ball did not become the next Woodstock or
LiverAid. With the exception of the special appearance by two
members ofREM, none of the acts had records in Billboard’s top 50.
The ball featured En Vogue who also provided backing vocals for First
Brother Roger Clinton. Soul Asylum who did a cover of Fleetwood
Mac's "Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.“ Boyz II Men singing
their recordrbreaking single ‘The End of the Road.” 10000 Maniacs.
who were joined on stage by REM‘s Michael Stype. hall of U2 and half

had backing vocals provided by a high school choir. Although there
were sevetal interesting performances. the event was hardly the best
that MTV or youth culture could produce.

Een though the Inaugural Ball lacked substance, MTV sent a
message to Washington and the United States in general. It is now
1993. Theyouth ofAmerica have power. Their voices and culture can
no longer be ignored.

Ward Confused... Again

To the Editor:

I’m so confused.

Some of you may remember last
semester sometime when someone
stole my collection of very valuable
baubles(oratleastveryeool baubles).
Today they came back. I’m so con-
fused. If you remember. what was
taken was a bunch of baubles of little
or no street value,acouplco’ whistles.
and a twenty dollar bill which was
pinned to the wall. I could accept the
theft of the money as greed. but the
meft of the baubles made no sense
whatsoever. Today Ireccivcd a brown
manilla envelope containing all my
baubles wrapped up in tow sheets of
tissue paper to protect them. Also
included wereanametag(Natl-ISC),
aphoto ofme and a friend and a $20
bill. lam so confused. On the enve-
lope said merely “Nat Ward. (To
bolster your misplaced faith in hue
manity—)." I am so confused. III
was in a movie I sould start looking
for a butcher knife weilding psycho
wth my haircut. But I’m not, so I’m
just confused. Some people on my
floor think I’ve got a secret admirer
(but then why did they take the $20).
