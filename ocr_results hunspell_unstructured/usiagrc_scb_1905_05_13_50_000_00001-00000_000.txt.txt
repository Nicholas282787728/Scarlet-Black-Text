' THE COE GAME,

Grinnell Wins in the Eighth by a
Fortunate Combination of
Circumstances.

The score (4-2) dosen’t tell the com-
plete tale of Grinuell's victory Over
Coe yesterday entire home grounds.

Coe iresh irom her struggle at Ames
Thursday when she let the ”aggies”
out by only the narrowest margin,
appeared in tile Grinnell ranks yester‘
day and proceeded to take charge of
aoairs in these precincts. Everything
went wrong with the home bunch
during the early part, of the game and
this, connected with the fact that One
did her best hitting during the ﬁrst
innings,is sufﬁcient to actiount for her
lead of two scores up till the 7th

square. Things at. this stage of the

game ' looked rather dubious for the
home team and a shut out would not
have been a surprise. Baylor who did
the pitching for the visitors, was very
selhsh in allowing hits and it was not
until Smithson‘s singie in the 7th
iollowed by Wilder’s two tagger which
pushed Smithson over the home plate,
that things assumed a brighter aspect.
Barber who worked on the slab for
locals reiused to give the visitors
another chance todo anything serious.

it was in the eighth that the balloon
went up and reinsed to descend until
three more scores were accredited to
the scarlet and black. Slow holding
and three successive passed balls
account for the three runs Grinnell
scored in the eighth.

The Score:

GIKINNELL.

A SKETCH 0F SCHILLER.

In recognition of the 100tliannivei‘s-
Etry of the death of the great VVeirnitr
poet, yesterday’s chapel service, \yiLh
Protessor nurnet in char-ge,was devote
ed maconsideratiun of the life and
work of Schiller. The anniversary
has been recently commemorated in
several universities and colleges of
America as well as everywhere in Ger
many, in many places several days
being given over to the purpose of
honoring the man who Stands as the
best beloved of German poc ts as
Goethe stands as the greatest.

Schiller was from first to last the
apostle of liberty and his ’works, em-
bodying his distaste for restraint,
made not asmrtll contribution to the
growth oiasimilar spirit among the
German people. From his ﬁrst work
[0 his last his words speak freedom—
absolute and universal freedom. “The
Robbersl’sets forth the poet's attitude
toward despotism: No man is good
enough to rule his brother absolutely.
Schiller was still chilling under the
restraints of discipline When l’i’illinm
Tcll was produced as his lical contri
bution to the world’s classic driirnii.

And Schiller knew despotism ﬁrst
hand. As an army surgeon at eight
dollars per month he had felt the
rancor of oppression. As an observer
of events he had synipztthi‘Led with a.
fellow literary man whom a (lulte had
tryannicriily imprisoned.

It was alter Schiller‘s acquaintance
with oocthc had ripened into the
closest Of friendship that the genius
of the former bore its fullest fruit.
His early tastes as reﬂected in his
themes Were of the Wild and lurid
type. It required the soitening inﬂur
ence of this close friendship to guide
his eiforts toward Subjects more
worthy.

’Oir Wi bur H. Schr g has been
appointed ’to supervise the organizing
of the Y. M. C. A. in the Medical De-
partment olthe University oiChicago.

in Yesterday's Matchesionly one
Court in Shape.

The iowa College tennis players
met delcat yesterday in both doubles
and singles at the hands of their old

opponents from Allies. The games

on the whole, though emphatically
won by the visiting players, furnished
some good exhibitions oi the real
sport and Girnpcll has every reason
to be satisﬁed with the showing made
by her men.

The tournament began at twothirty
in order that it might not detract
from the interest in the May Lunch-
eon which was to hold iorth during

the two best tennis hours. It was

lortunate that the men took an early
start for the hard rains had spoiled
every court butcne and the dinerent
matches had to be played, temp or
speaking, in Indian ﬁle. First'to
pear were Blatherwick and Stan

in singles. After a hard ion .t on
Stanton took the ﬁrst set" so. In the
second a rally by Blatlierwlck brought
the Grinnell man up to even terms
but the third set went to Stanton

with :1 rushr West's match With

Cessna, which followed, had a similar
result, the former loosing two sets and
winning one. The scores were: 6-4,
3-6, 6-3.

In the doubles three sets in live were
to constitute a. victory. Blatherwick
and West were arrayed against Stair
ton.and Cessna. Two 5 e t 5 went
promptly to the visitors and the third
was won by Glinneli. The score in
the linal set suggests the story of it.
Ames took itquickly and with it the
honors orthe day, M, 0.2, 4-6, and
(571 are the ﬁgures.
