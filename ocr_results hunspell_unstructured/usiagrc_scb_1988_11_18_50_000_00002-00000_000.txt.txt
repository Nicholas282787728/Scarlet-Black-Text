pushes complete

divestiture frOm
South Africa

by Stephen Hardwick

With $1000 of histown
money, Dave Cooke '82 has
started "The Endowment for Di-
vestiture and Social Change."
The purpose of the fund is to en-
courage the Grinnell College
Board of Trustees to divest come
pletety from South Africa. "I
would like to contribute to this
school," Cooke said, "but it‘s
hard to feel good about that . . .
with this school's continued in—
vestment in companies that do
business with South Africa." The
fund is modeled after a similar
endowment at Harvard. Cooke's
fund currently contains approxi-
mately $1,500. .

The fund could become
available to the college in two
ways. First, the college could
divest-completely from compa-
nies that do business in South
Africa before the year 2000. The
other way the college could re,
ceive the money is for apartheid
to end in South Africa before the
year 2000 and for the college to
adopt "principles recognizing so-
cially responsible investment." If

trustees and representatives of
Students to End Apartheid.

Drake emphasized that the
"trustees feel their primary oblia
gation is to the financial well—
being of the college." He added
that several alumni have threat-
ened to withdraw their ﬁnancial
suppon iflhc college divested.

Cooke expressed a different
view of the role of the college.
"I would like to see Grinnell as a
leader on social issues. Right
now I just don’t think it is, and I
don't see any reason why it can't
be. It‘s almost embarrassing. . ,
. A progressive, liberal arts col-
lege doesn't already have an in-
vestment plan that reflects the
values it is trying to instill in its
students."

Students to End Apartheid
greeted Cooke's idea with a luke-
warm reaction. The organization
was lobbying the Lrustees for the
South African scholarships.
Carol Pilgrim, of SEA said, "In
getting that proposal passed we
wanted to show the student

 

 

”I would like to see Grinnell as a leader art
social issues. Right now I just don’t think it is,
and I don't see any reason why it can’t be."

neither condition is met, the
money will go to the United Ne-
gro College Fund.

Cooke's endowment will
go to the college only if the col»
lege "divests completely." He
said the recent promise to divest
all trusteerconlrollcd investments
is inadequate. The move ”should
appease people for the next five
years," Cooke said.

Cooke, a graduate student
in physics at the University of
Chicago, ﬁrst proposed the fund
in a letter to the editor in the
Spring 1988 edition of the Grim
net! Magazine. He received six
or seven responses from that let
ter.

President George Drake has
said that Cooke's offer had no ef»
feet on the recent trustee decision
to divest the LrustcevconLrollcd
portion of the endowment come
pletely. Most of the trustees did
not team of Cooke’s plan until it
was mentioned at the Oct. 21

commitment to work with the
Lrustees. The proposal showed
that type of commitment." The
organization felt it would hurt its
position with the trustees if it
raised money for Cooke's fund.
The organization preferred to
work with the trustees using the
1985 resolution as a base instead
of making threats.

The account for the fund is
held at the South Shore Bank in
Chicago. Cooke has direct cone
trol of the funds, however the ac-
count is in the name of the en-
dowment and Lhe bank has a
statement of purpose. For the
money to be released, Cooke and
three other alumni who helped
start the fund must approve the
transaction. Cooke described this
process as "informal." After ap-
proval by Cooke and his col-
leagues, an officer at the bank
must agree that the release is in
accordance with Cooke's Slach
ment of purpose.

Students favor rock music‘and
comic films in SGA survey

by Meredith Levy

Early this fall. the survey
committee conducted a mail sur-
vey to examine Grinnell students'
opinions on concerts and films
offered on campus and on their
attitudes toward Student Govem-
ment Association. Of the one-
third of the student body sampled.
the survey committee received
responses from twenty percent of
the total student population. The
respondents were fairly evenly
distributed amongst the four
classes, and an even number of
men and women was surveyed.
Of Lhc 247 students surveyed,
211 live on campus, while 46
live off-campus. The following
summary of results can be further
investigated by obtaining a copy
of the detailed statistics from the

survey committee.

The overall results of the
students' opinions of the concerts
offered on campus show that rock
rates highest as the type of music
preferred, followed closely by
reggae and blues. The survey re-
vealed that almost three»fourths
of the student body had attended
at least one concert this semester
(before the issuing of the survey).
The officampus students, who
represented the group with the
lowest attendance, favored blues.
reggae, and pop, Their opinion
had less inﬂuence on the overall
pick of the most popular type of
concert. To improve the attenr
dance of off—campus students In
addition to meeting the wants of
the majority of people, the sur»

vey committee advised the con-
cert committee to increase the
number of reggae and blues con-
cens. '

The completed surveys for
ﬁlms illustrate similar results to
the concerts in that off campus
students have a lower rate of at-
Iendance, perhaps due to isolation
from campus, or maybe due to
the choice in films, (or in con»
certs). Overall, 95 percent of the
student body has seen at least one
film on campus this semester.
The majority of people, including
off campus students, selected
comedy as their favorite type of
movie; movies released in the
last year and adventure films
trailed closely behind. Students
claimed selection of films or
conflicting events as the most
popular justification for lack of
attendance. Generally, the ﬁlms
have succeeded in drawing large
audiences. Showing of comedies,
current films, and adventure ﬁlms
would insure the popularity of
films on campus.

Lastly, the survey
committee analyzed the student
opinion of the SGA. The ques
tions in the survey investigated
the degree of the students‘ in
volvemcnt in SGA, and also in-
cluded questions determining the
students' attitude conceming as
pects of this government. The
survey asked questions on the ef-
fectiveness of the Senators, on
the response of SGA to the stu-
dents wants, and others; Fifty-
four percent of those surveyed
gave a good rating to SGA, six-
teen percent had nequal opinions,
and twenty-five percent did not
know Overall, the SGA seems
to satisfy the Grinnell student
body. The survey committee cnr
couraged SGA to stimulate an
increase in student-participation
