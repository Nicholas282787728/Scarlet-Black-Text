Theobald, English Proﬁ, .
Goes To Bat For Comics

By Lynn Aeheriir'riii
John Theobald, English instructor-
at Grinnell College recently re-
vealed his fondness for comic
strips when he used Li’l Abner as
an analogy tor Dostoievshy’s
“Sacred Simpleton" iii a college
class.

Mr. Theobald regularly follows
about a dozen different strips, but

'hls fovarites are Blondie and Lil

Abner.

“Blondie," he said, “is popular
with everyone, but it has a spe-
cial appeal to mar ied comic fans,
Blontlle's home is essentially a
lllatrial‘chy," (where the woman
is boss).

“In the office Dogwood is Subs
ject to the boss. hilt whenever the
boss dares enter Blondie's home.
he invariably comes out on the
short end of the score.”

Having lived in the orient and
in England until ten years ago,
Mr. Theobald pointed out that
Blondie deftly illustrated the es-

sential difference between Ameri-
can and European makeup.

“In America," he said. ”ewe
noinic tyranny does not ntfect
home li[e Hrrc is a true picture
of the American home, the keys
stone of American democracy.”

“Abner," he continued. “is coin-
pletely stupid, honest, loyal to
family and law. iiivulnerable with
respect to his petrified head. Ali-

of onc American ideal. He is com—
pletcly happy-go-lucky.”

“In Li’l Abner we see a wide
range of American character de—
picted with skill and dash. In a
crowd scene. you will discovcr
that the artist has paid as metic-
ulous attention to each figure of
lthc background as he has to the
main characters. I think Al Capp
is a genius."

Mr. Theobald went on to say
that Capp’s work was very simi-
lar to that of the nineteenth cent—
ury French artist. Daumicr. In a

 

ncr is tho cxti-ome Simplificationl

irunning satire of Parisian lite.
Dauiiiier made candid shots with
his charcoal and easel of the corri-
nion people of that century.
“Capp's work also reminds inc
of Hog‘at‘th's, in eightceiith cene
tury England," Thcobald said.
"Hogal‘tli's worlr was largely
composed of coarse, car-thy. ext
trcniely lianh portraits of the life
of his era. or course. iieitherHo-
gar-th noi- Dauniici- adopted the
method of today‘s comic strip ar-
tists in using a series or pictures
to present a continued story."
Mr. Theobald also follows
“They'll Do IL Every Time", Ted
Asliby's “Ned Brant", and "Invis-
ihlc Starlet O'Neill,” although he
thinhs Scar-let is “an animated
Sti'lprteﬂsc," “Bringing Up Eatli-
icr” is also on his prefer-red list,
because it illustrates his theory
on matriarchy. He thoroughly dis-
likes “Superman" iiowever, be—
cause it is a naive boastfulness
expressed in load prosc.n
