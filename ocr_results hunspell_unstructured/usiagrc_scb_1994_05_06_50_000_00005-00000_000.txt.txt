J ewish—Catholic statement warns educators against Holocaust revisionism

- Synagogue Council ofAmerica and National Conference of Catholic Bishops warn against Holocaust deniers

‘ Synagogue Council OfAmericu
N a sharply-worded state
I ment, Catholic and Jewish
leaders have condemned so-
called Holocaustrevisionists who
try “to camouﬂage their message of
hatred and antisemitism under a ve-

' neer of scholarly terminology,"
( The Joint Statementon Dealr
’ ing With Holocaust Revisionism
was issued by the lnterreligious

Affairs Committee of the Syna-
gogue CouncilofAmerica(SCA)
and the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops' Committee for
Ecumenical and Interreligious
Affairs (BCEIAA). The state-
ment points out that the Holo-
caust revisionists in fact seek “to
deny the crimes of the Nazis,
particularly the attempt to exter-
minate the Jewish people . tWe
condemn theseprejudiced efforts and
the racial hatred they would incite."

“In this guise of holocaust
revisionism,” the joint statement
continues. “the deniers of the
evils perpetrated by Nazism
against so many peoples and
groups in Europe sought to reha-
bilitate the tattered image oi Na-
tional Socialism (Nazism)," with
some initial success “in unsus-
pecting academic symposia that
took their claims to scholarly ina
tegrity at face value."

A Tap Into the Rest Of the World

Living on our two blocks of campus, we are so absorbed in our own activities
that we sometimes forget that there are other college campuses out there that have
similar problems and lifestyles.

In an effort to branch out off of the Grinnell campus, the Scarlet & Black will
be providing selections from the National Student News Service (NSNS) based
in San Francisco and run by editors of other college newspapers all over the
nation. All that is featured in the “Off The Wire” from now on will come from
NSNS and other news services.

We at the 5&8 would like to know your opinion of “Off The Wire.” Please
' send a note to Box T—l or vax [SANDB] and tell us what you think.

Holocaust deniers have adopted
a new tactic, placing advertiser
ments in college newspapers.
Again hiding their true intent
under more respectable guise,
such as so-called committees for
‘open debate’ on the Holocaust,
the unsolicited ads deny the real-
ity of the gas chambers and of
Nazi genocide."

“The deniers then argue that the
ﬁrst amendment should be read to
impel university and college publi-
cations to publish whatever material
they may choose to provide"

The religious leaders condemn
such arguments as “a perversion of
the First Amendment" and urge that
“all educational institutions and their

publications, whether ofﬁcial or stu-

horrifying realities of the Holocaust"

The declaration was devele
oped in the course oftwiceAyearly
meetings. begun in 1987, between
the Synagogue Council and the
Bishops’ Conference, The meek
ings cover a wide range of issues
of common concern. The joint
consultations are headed by
Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, Presi-
dent of the Synagogue Council
of America, and Cardinal John
O‘Connor of New York, Episco-
pal Moderator for Catholic-Jew-
ish relations for the US Catho-
lic Bishops.
