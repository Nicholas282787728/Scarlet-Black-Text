The Student Council and the

Dame Nature threw several
mysterious herbs into the local
weather brewing pot. The result
went to the student body—a one-
day vacation from class yesterr
day on the warmest mid-Novem-
ber day in history. under the
guise of an "Honor Day."

The ‘Honor Day label was
put on by the student council
which felt that some recognition
should be made to the football
team, although the win over Coe
did not warrant a victory day.

Highlights of the recess included
Studentrinspil'ed ground breaks
ing ceremonies for the new gym-
nasium, a Studentrfaculty volley-
ball game and an afternoon of
roller-skating. ‘

The decision to have an “Hou-
or Day” was reached by a meet-
ing of the student Council Sun-
day morning. Formal approval
was given the project when Dr.
Henry s, Conard, clean of the
faculty. was contacted by tele
phone in Red Oak, la.

The first spadeful of dirt for
gymnasium 'ConSLruction was dug
by Jerry Grant, president of the
Men’s Honor ‘G.’ Grant was
handed the shovel by Kent

dent, with the entire ceremony‘
held under the sponsorship of the

The ground breaking ceremony
was preceded by a pep meeting

Alden Sees Mrs. Pryor’s Play As
Personal Triumph, Grinnell Gain

By Henry Alden

Last night a large and
demonstrative audience of
lirst nighters at the Uni-
versity of Iowa City saw
the world premiere of Sara
Sherman Pryors play,
“MlssiSSippi” The occasion
was doubly exciting for the
many Griniiellians who
made the trip to Iowa City
to see for the first time on
any stage this folk play of
the river and to join in
honoring its authon

If Mrs. Pryor showed
some traces of embarrass-
ment at the closc of the
play in the unfamiliar role
of an “author" making- a
personal appcaraucc, the
play itself proved that she
is perfectly at home in
writing for the tlieatie.

This saga of the river folk

who follow irresistibly the

cycle of flood, rehabilita-

tion, and ’flood and who
would rather die near the

river than live away from it, is
remarkable for the wide range of
human drama that it einbraccs—
from the humor of lazy Molly
and her "shiftless" husband and
the satiric comedy of the radio
broadcast of interviews with flood
victims to the pathos of Dan and
Stella’s romance and the tragedy
of Mom and Pop, The atmosphere
of the river people is authentic-
ally captured by the accurate (li-
alect and the inclusion of actual
folk songs, The scenes in which
Ippy, the river man, appears show
some of the epic sweep of frontier
folk legend.

Under the skilled direction of
the author and of Mr, Mabie, the
Experimental Theatre of the state
University gave a memorable per-

sets show a cross-section of the
Mississippi River shack, both in-
side and out, upstairs and down.
For the first scene of the second
act, entitled “The Flood,” the low-
er half of the stage is blacked out
to represent the whirling waters,
and the action takes place in the
loft. Equally striking is the set—

Briggeman's Job
Given +0 Funk
In Revision

“Slightly Nautical," college
musical show, received its
Sixth postponement this
week, according to Kent
Hampton, student council presi—
dent.

Thc new date was given by
Hampton as the week before
spring vacation.

Ineligibility of cast members
was named as the direct cause
for the musical productions sixth
date delay.

Briggeman Resigns,

Catherine mink, Cleveland soph-
omore, will steer the production,
following the resignation of
Joseph Briggeman, Hampton said.

she has been Vicerpresident of
the Derelict club, musical organi-
zation in charge of the show
Briggeman‘s letter of resignation
stated that lack of time to de-
vote to the production forced him
to withdraw.

Patterned After Harvard.

Originated last year by Ray
Nelson, Anthony Vrsnek, and
Mark Moody, "slightly Nautical"
was patterned after the Harvard
Hasty Pudding show. It was orig-
inally sponsored by the Friars,
out the student council took over
in March. The navy play has had
rough sailing, however.

Casting difficulties plus financial
trouble and lack of open dates
has resulted in six postponements
of the show.

““19 know that another post-

ponement will bring doubts to the
minds of some students that the
show will ever be produced,"
Hampton said,

Executive directors of the show
in addition to Miss Funk are:
Jack Ti-ucsdale, business man-
ager; Dorothy Tarleton, dance
director; Josephine Smith, music
director; Kay Mills, acting super-
visor; and Allen Arney, orchestra
director.
