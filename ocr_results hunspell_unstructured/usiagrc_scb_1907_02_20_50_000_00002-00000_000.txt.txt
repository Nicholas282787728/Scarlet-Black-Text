Vote Now.

Judging by the results or the
Semester Fee balloting it can never
again be lusinualed that Iowa Col-
lege does nDL recognize [lie need of
the altruistic spirib. We are informed
by the committee in charge that the
larger number of votes opposing the
proposition are from people who very
evidently are against it ior the sake
of those whom they think unable to
pay the six dollar tax. Such a feeling
is surely commendable as is me one
shown by many who might with
justice plead inability to pay, ior they
havens a rule shown magnauimity in
the mattcrand been willing to give
up [or the good or the many.

The importance or voting on the
matter one way or tho other cannot
be made too impressive. The time
has been extended till 5 o‘clock p. in.
and every one should cast a ballot.

We are in receipt or a very good
communication on the matter or
poster stealing which has become an
211mb common practice or late. The
article was unsigned, however, and
cannot be published unlessthe author
makes himselt or herself known to
the management. The SCARLET asp
BLACK expects to stand responsible
ior all matter printed in its columns
and this precaution is necessary as a
protection against an abuse at the
rights oi the student body to n voice
through that medium. We shall be
pleased to keep the article and pub-
llsh it when the author isrnade known,
though the name need not be made
public.

The inllowing from a country ex-
change proves that college inliuences
are oiten felt in unlocked rnr places:

“Alter the last social many people
saidwnid you ever see a better behalu
ed crowd? it seemed as it it was
some college airair,‘ When things are
that way people have a good time."

Last rear 3 Grinnell song, composed
