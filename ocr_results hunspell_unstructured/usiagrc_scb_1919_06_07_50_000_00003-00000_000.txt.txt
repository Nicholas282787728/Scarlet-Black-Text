ENHY MDHBENTHAU 18
IN'TEHESIINE PERSON

nunencemenl: Speaker nus lizul
Varied Career ~ Was Envoy To
Turkey During War.

(From the Grinnell Herald).
”Hem-y,” she said to her husband, “I
. sure those women are in trouble."
The hushand had been uneasy ovcr
eni himself, and although he had a
sy day ahead or him, he said, “Let‘s
. see." This short speech very well
nstrates the character and lire—pun
so at Henry liorgenthan, urAmbas-
dol' to Turkey.

In November, 1916, Mr. lilorgcnthau
rived in Constantinople as America's
hessador to that nation. .His
'enty»six nionths work there just
evious to our entrance into the war,
needed to him the title “the Ambas—
dor." By this title he is known to
gh and low oi niany nations in Can-
ntiiiople.
Mr. Morgeuthaii has arisen, mostly
his own endeavors. to he one at
w York's greatest ﬁnancial lungs.
t let us not dwell‘ on such weighty
hjects as wealth, because human
enacteristics, especially in Mr. Mor—
nthaii's case. are far more interest-
3.
Above. all else, lilr. Morgenthau is a
moorat. By joining tomes with
illiani G. McAdam and William F.
inhs, he had much to do with Mr.
ils'oli‘s nomination for the presi-
.ey'at Baltimore. .
Education has always been one of
r. Morgenthairs greatest interests.
is probably accounts tor the tact
at the students of Robert College
-d the college for Girls, in Constanti»
me, are always referred to as his
hlldren."
He never pretends to be what he is
t, and yet he never allows anyone to
Home him at less than he is. Pic<
re a small man, gray haired and
glitly paid, with a head set slightly
rward on strictly military shoulders,
en eyes, a perpetual smile, and a
use—cronped beard—and you have the
.. al, brisk and delightml gentleman,
no Ambassador."
grinnell college has been very thre-
. te‘in securing h'meakér with such -
personality and a man or national
. ortance to deliver the college Coin:
neement address on June 24.
