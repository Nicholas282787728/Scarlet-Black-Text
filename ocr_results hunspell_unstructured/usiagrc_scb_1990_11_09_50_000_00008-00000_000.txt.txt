Kubrick's Futuristic
Clockwork Orange

Malcolm McDowell Stars

in Dank and Kaleidoscopic
Fable of Ultra-Violence,
Droogs and Beethoven

By Danelle Baker

It is a race through bone-white
and Technicolor, a duel between
violence and remorse, the re—
sounding void between institution-
alization and chaos. Itis Clockwork
Orange. A dank and kaleidoscopic
thriller, Clockwork Orange is both
enraging and engaging, leaving an
aftertasre thh the finality of an
explanation poinL

British actor Malcolm
McDowell plays Alex, the ruthless
Droogan leader lumed government
guinea pig. l-le initiates ‘hasty bits
of ulLra-violence" with his clan of
milk-drinking, prominently jock-
strapped Droogs, “Wilding“ with
mindless abandon. He Is seized by
the police. and after 'an incarr
ceration of two years marked by
insincere Bible study and claiming
thatheonly knows mathe“wantsto
be good." Alex is released to thc

government [or experimeniaiion.
He is to be cleansed of violent ten»

 

dencies, a socmpath turned Sa-L

maritan. yet the surreal world diat
he once shook to distortion holds
no mercy.

The sinisterintroductton to both
Alex and the film itselfyarc decep-
tiyc,’leaying the viewer dazed with

a hateful mix of anarchy and gang
rape. Alex. though by far the ugli-
est character of Clockwork 0r-
tinge, is the most real in a curious
aboulface of roles. He Is the son,
rapist, martyr and hero of the film,
and the vulnerable observer rides
with each paradox. There is a
smooth conversion from the
wretched young fiend "up to some
nastiness.”tothesoftenedboyrchild
singing in astranger's bathtub. He
isboth LhevicLim and Ihevictimizcd,
and the awareness of this enters
multidimensionally.

Clockwork Orange is n weighty
film, dense with contemporary
issues. The film is studded with
the presence of the media and
political controversy, yet ever-
presentsexuality, both in art and in
action, gives a surreal tone. The
cold formality of Alex’s prison
is the polar opposite to his haunt,
the Milk Bur, where bloodlessly
pale female forms are strewn
about in more Ihan compromising
posItions. The conu-ast )5 much
like Alex, a lover of Beethoven
and a rapist, and a hint to the
watery depths of Clockwork 0r-
ange, where Judgment should not
‘vcntttrc. Beyond the hideous lies
the intrigue.

Robert J ohnson‘s Newly-Released
Hollow, Haunting Delta Blues

 

By Bill Hoeman

 

Stephen Davis describedRobert
Johnson as “the most crucial blues
musician who ever lived.” He has
inﬂuenced artists as diverse as
SOnnyBoy Williamson,StevieRay
Vaughan and Mick Jagger. The
few bootleg recordings one can
find of Johnson were prized pos-
sessions for their deep tone. Eric
Clapton called his music the “most
soulful music I have ever heard."

Butwho is Robenlohnson? This
all-so—crucial ﬁgure of Ihe country
folk blues period eluded everyone
until the past few years, when
Johnson’sworkswererediscovered,
and his bluesman's life docu-
mented.

All of this becomes uniquely
important because the entire body
of Johnson‘s recorded work has
been recently released on CD, as
part of an effort to make the early
blues of Johnson, Howlin' Wolf,
Son House and others more acces-
sible to modern listeners.

The songs recorded are unique
in every way. Johnson‘s hollow.
percussive guiiar style is a perfect
complement to his darkling, nasal
voice, which is the embodiment of
the blucsman’s life: lonely, inde-

pendent and taboo to outsiders.

Johnson’s recorded work in-
cludes someof Ihe mostinfluentiztl
songs for modem musicians. The
Everly Brothers, Muddy Waters and
John Lee Hooker plugged in their
primitivcelcctrit: guitarsand played
harder versions of J ohnson's music
in DeLmil and New Orleans. His
inﬂuence is felt everywhere.

The life of Johnson is equally
impressive, and it seems Ihat evc
eryone has heard the legend. Born
‘in Robinsonville, Miss, he became
an aspiring bluesman, only to find
himself derided for his lack of tal-
ent. No one saw Johnson for the
nextyear,buthesoonafteremergetl,
with a new style, a more urgent
voice and a taste for booze and
women. People muttered that
Johnson had waited by a dark Mis-
sissippi Crossroad and had Samn
time his guitar, sealing a pact Ihat
gaveJohnson unlimited suecessand
gave Salan his soul.

Johnson'srecordingsspanmany
areas of early blues. There are
violent love Songs like “30720
Blues," and “Me and the Devil
Blues," where he sings, “Me and
the Devil was walking sideby side/
I’m going to beat my woman until
I get satisﬁed." There are songs of

pttnning sexual imagery like
“Terraplane Blues" where John-
son dcscribes a woman in terms of

But Johnson's life can be
summed up in thC opening lines to
his most urgent song, “Hellhound
on My Trail:” “I've got to keep
movin'lBluesfallin’ down likehail/
With a Hellhound on my trail.”
