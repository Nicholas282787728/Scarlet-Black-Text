to these rumors. El'llldle)', Kasper,

The senior fire has been lining up
in practice with Captain Martin at

Davis and hay, forwards. Just how
strong this combination will prove in
the opening game cannot be foretold,

appearance in practice work this week.
On the other band, the Yeal'lings, in
case none are ineligible, will probably
offer opposition with Worth at center,
Cochran and McElroy, forwards, Brind-

also other promising candidates who
look good enough to land a permanent
