EYES WIDE OPEN

Time for gyrttocratie SGA

Tomoi-roii',thetittcenth,isthe last
day to declare yourself a candidate
(or tlie President of Student GOVCII’IV
inent or the Vice-PresidenI/President
ofAeademIc Affairs. Two questions
plagueitsallatthtspoint. Firstofall.
if the VicerPresidcnl has so much
responsibtlity in terms ofacademics,
then why should the PAA not also be
done by the President? And since the
President ofSGA has hours of seemr

- inglypointlessmeetingstoaiteiidand
mountainsofpapenvorktodo,should
this sortofbanal appointment setting
be done by somconc of vice-presi-
dential status? This only works under
the assumption that the hierarchy
should begin With what is most im-
portant. That is what we mean when
we say ”hierarchy,” isn't it?

Ifwechangethehierarchicalposi-

. tion of the two offices, then my sec-
ondproblem will besolved, which is:
Why is it that wimmin (my spelling,
live with it) almost never run for the
office of President? I was the only
one to attempt it in my four years.
And I don’t think that counts. If the
office of President is so important,
then why aren’t the wimmin inter-

Shelly West

ested? Iproposethatwecitlierswtlch
the order ofpower, or redistribute the
power entirely.

After all, it’s not as if Grinnell
College is lacking in female leaders,
The growing Black Women's Sup-
port Group attests to that. The strong
and youngwtmmin in PAFAattest to
that. The fact that almost the entire
SGA cabinet is made up of wimmin
attests to that. The only other men on
Cabinet are the Treasurers. It is very
Significant also that both of the Trcar
surers are white males. If the control
of the student body treasury isn’t
power, please tell me what is. Last
year they were two white males. Last
year we had an Asian»American
womott forV.P. andawhitemalefor
President. This year we seem to have
fallen along Similar lines. I don't
know about the rest of you, but I
voted for the three-legged eat. Some-
thing different please.

Where are the wimmin when we
need them most? Are you deciding

COMMON SENSE
Leftist Kristallnacht has arrived

Gracing the coverofa recent issue
of The New Republic is a picture of
David Duke, the Louisiana populist
who is running for president. Inside
we findtheusual pietiesaboutDuke’s
“thinly veiled" racism and the danger
he poses to our society. Nowhere is
it granted that Duke does have a firm
grasp of the ugly and sad facts that
face many whites in liberated
America.

We are in the midst of a leftist
Kristallriachl, the victims, this time,
being dead men—or dead, white,
European men. Christopher Colum-
bus is savagely attackedas textbooks
which praise him are ejected from
school curricula (in that sense Co»
lumbusismsetingthefatethatPatrick
Henry met some time ago).

The schools are awash in
“multiculturist” sewage. Students are
told that the western canon is irre-
deemably marred by racism, sexism,
homophobia, gynophobia, etc, that it
has “got to go,” in the Rev. Jackson’s
eloquentwords, and that the works of
those literary giants Frantz Fanon and
Rigoberta Menchu must replace it.
And indeed Hamlet is being sup-
planted byJ. Rigaberta Manchu (the
story of an oppressed Gautemalan
woman who comes to adopt femi-
nism and Marxismiwhich, by the
way, are purely western doctrines.)

Anyone who dares to speak in
defense of the western works is
branded as a “social Fascist.“ When
Carol Iannone, a notorious defender
ofthecanon, triedto getajob with the
NationalEndowmentfortheI-Iumani-

Mike Washburn

ties, she was Borked. Not surpris-
ingly,therearenotmanypeoplewith
the courage to defend it. Amongpolt
ticians, David Duke is nearly alone in
doing so. He is also alone in his frank
opposition to liberal immigration poli»
cies, a source of anxiety to many
white Americans

As Chinese, Mexicans, Haitians,
and Jamaicans pour into this country
at the rate of nearly a million a year.
whites begin to ask grave questions
aboutthe future. Will the southwestr

em states absorb enough Mexicans
that the Mexicans can vote to secede,
provoking another Civil War? Will
thequarrels overschoolcurriculathat
we are seeing today escalate into a
full-blown Kulturkampf‘.7 Will
America become another South Af-
riea, where a tiny white minority is
threatened with extermination?
Also helping Duke are the “antir
AIDS" freaks. Loudly they blame
“homophobia” in our society and
government for the spread of the vi4
rus. But, as we are never told, AIDS
is conu'acted mainly through sodomy.

yesterday.

I woke up at about ten yesterday
because someone was pounding
loudly on my door. Groggily, I stage
gered out of bed and peered outside.

“What the hell." I snapped, pleas»
antly trying to hide my annoyance
behind some light. early-morning
banter.

One of die firstryears from my
floor was standing there. He looked
awfiilisortoflike a fifthrycar senior
who's just found out that he could
have giaduated on time if he’d only
taken a semester of bowling.

“Laura, this is terriblel," he
babbled, nearly incoherent. His hair

Laura Moran

was disheveled and he looked a little
wild around the eyes. “Have you seen
my roommate?”

“Not for a while,"I answered with
surprise, trying to think back. “Why?"

“He’s disappeared! Gonel,“ gib-
bered Alan. “He was just sitting in
the lounge, dozing off after his nine
o‘clock, and then I went to breakfast
and when I came back he was gone! "

“What’s so weird about mat?" I

They all poisoned themselves with

Tyson did, and what he will go to jail
for, was harm directed not at himself,

analysis, stupid. But for Mike Tyson
