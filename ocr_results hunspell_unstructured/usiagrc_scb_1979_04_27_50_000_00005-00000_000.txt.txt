Chinese cooking and the sentence that wouldn’t die

Let them eat cake: The ad-
ministration has blessed us with
yet another thoughtful and
illuminating policy statement.
Chinese cooking is too messy, it
says, and preparation of such iood
is not permitted in Gn'nnell House.

Word has it that a faculty
member requested permission to
hold a class in Grinnell House. The
class would include a genuine
Chinese meal. Our ambitious
faculty member was told by a
member of the administration that
Chinese cooking was too messy.

Terri Tiddle

Request denied.

YOU MAY WONDER how this
administrator knew that Chinese
cooking would only slop up Grin
nell House; so did our professor.
Accordingly, he put that very
question to our liberal-minded
administrator.

Administrators are no dummies.
This one called forth a wealth of
empirical data to prove his point.
He responded that when he \vatv
ches his wife prepare Chinese food
he notices that it creates a mess.

WHO COULD ARGUE with that

poweriul justification of ethno
centricity? Well, our professor
wasn't very impressed (they can
be so stubborn, these [acuity
members). Eventually, good food
won out over a messy kitchen. Next
they'll be letting RUSSIAN classes
have meals in Grinnell House. The
Communist Threat has finally hit
home. Remember, you read it here
ﬁrst.

Many of us were amused by the
lead sentence in the lead article of
the April 13 see. That was the one

describing campus thefts as “an
unsolvable problem with no easy
solutions," One student (Let's give
the kid some credit, It was Rich
Egan. I was there when he said it.)
called it “the dumbest sentence
ever written.” I agreed with Rich.
but little did i know that in the
following week the 8&3 would out
do iisell by printing the dumbest
editorial ever written. The topic of
the editorial was the dumbest
sentence ever written.

The Grinnell (‘ollege
Republicans have announced a
campus-wide search ior the Barry
Goldwater Chair. which is missing
from its traditional place in the Ed
Gilmour Social Studies Common
Room (formerly the PPPE (‘uucus
Room).

’l’llF. RUMOR IS that the chair
may not have lelt the third floor of
Carnegie and may indeed be in the
hands oi an economist. Barry
would take the chair back it he
knew this to he the case He almost
look the chair back when he
learned lhal the name of the
Caucus Room was changed to the

Only alter the intervention oi
