Laundry should not equal stress

by Howard Horn

Now that we' re all in col lege, we
have to take on new responsibilities.
Oncof the easiest responsibilities we
have is doing the laundry. lt‘sexpen»
sive but simple. The problem is,
there never seetns to beenough wash-
ers and dryers available to do laun-
dry. Every machineis full,whetherit
is in use or not. There’s always that
one washer with clothes in it that
havebeen sitting aroundsincelimmy
Carter was president. The simple
task of washing clothes has become
very frustrating.

Some people are bold enough to
take action into their own hands. If
they needa machine and the machine
is full and shut off they will take the
clothes out. Is this fair? Then again,
is it fair to leave clothes in a machine
for a long period of time? -

If we all are reasonable people
(which I think most of us are) we can
come to a solution. I have thought
about the subject and talked to many
people. After listening to all the
complaints, I have devised a plan. It
is fair, and ifit is universally adopted
throughout the campus, most of the
conﬂict over laundry ethics can be
resolved. IcallitThe SocialContract
for Doing Laundry.

Firstlet‘sremember that theother
people doing laundry are students
like yourself. Like you, they only
want to get their clothes clean as
quickly and conveniently as possible
sothattheycan dootherthings. Pleas
try to show some respect to them and
their property.

Never take clothes that are still
wet out of the dryer. Also, never put
someone else’s laundry on the ﬂoor.
There can be no crimes more sinful
than these.

If there are no machines availr
able. wait. Chances are the clothes
belong to a student who will be back

If it is a busy day, take no more

time. Other people have things to do
