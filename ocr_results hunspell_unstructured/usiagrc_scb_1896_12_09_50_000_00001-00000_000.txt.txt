The attendance at the meeting
of the society last Saturday even-
ing was small. owing to the ala-
sence of several members. The
program in fact exlempo-
raneous, because two of the ab-
sent ones were on tile program

Witmer attempted to stimn-ior
rize the news of tlle week, in which
he fairly succeeded although in
the opinion of tne critic some of
his items were not tvell chosen for
a concise summary.

Messrs. Marsll, Crabbe, Smith
and Peck appeared cxtemporan
eously on the lollowing subjects
respectively: “What Americans
Read;" “Class Football Games.”
--TlreAmericaiijiiigo;" “Athrig-
_itlal Poem."

The debate ontllesul)ject. “The
pension policy of tlle republican
party',” called forth many volun»
teers, and was perltaps the best
feature oftlie program. The reg
ular speakers wcre Jackson and
Graves [or tlle afﬁrmative, Tellier
and Lincoln for tlle negative.

The musical numbers presented
by Misses Manning and Stickles
added a pleasing variety to the

was

program.

Grlnnell Institute

The Grirfriell Institute held its
regular weekly session last Satur-
day evening.

Dennison opened the , program
with a well-written and exhaustive
paper on the “Chicago Strike.”
The paper showed a great deal of
investigation and intimate know»
ledge o: the facts in the case. It
was one of the best numbers pre-
sented to the society this year.

A selection from Barrie’s “A
Window iti Tllrums," was read by
Shadbolt, and Peterson followed
'with an interesting essay on
“Richard Harding Davis." ascrib-
ing to that gentleman and his
works a prominent place in Amer-
ican literature.

The extemporalleous work oi
the evening was above the aver--
age. spaulding gave his ideas on
"Basket Ball" and Huff advanced
several theories in regard to tire

 

best way of settling the much dIS'
cussed “Cabinet Question,”

A short review of the ”Cuban
Situation" was given by Crawford
follower] by Stipp who presented
some "Aspects or the Recent
Campaign" ill his usual interest:
ing manner.

At the request of the debaters
the regular debate was postponed
until the next meeting and Hart
closed the program with a two
minute talk on "Public Opinion "

In the bustiless meeting two
candidates w re elected to merrir
bership in the society.

Student Volunteer Meeting.

Mr. C. T. Studd. one of the
strongest men representing the
student volunteer movement, will
speak to the students Thursday
evening. at tllc college chapel, at
seven o'clock. Mr, Studd is a
graduate of Cambridge, where he
was “stroke” on the English crew.

This past stttnnler Mr, Studd
rendered sttcll splendid services
at the Knoxville and Northtield
summer schools that he was inc
duced by some irieiitis to return
to Atncricathis fall and visit sonle

of the leading college centers ol‘

the country. He has been out in
Nebraska, attending a convention
there, and is on Ills return to Chic
cago. It is a rare privilege to any
institution to have Mr. Studd. and
we may consider ourselves very
fortunate in having an opportune
ity of hearing such a man.

Mr. Stiidd does not represent
any organization, but simply
comes to this country at the anl'
tation of a few friends who have
volunteered to pay his expenses.
in order that the great spiritual
impulse of his word and life may
come to the colleges of thrs coun—
try.

Tile other meetings for Thurs-
day evening will be postponed
and we trust that every student
will take this opportunity ct hc‘ar-
trig Mi. Studd.

Sophomores, 14; Juniors. 0.

Sattiiday‘s game between the
sophomores and juniors was one
of the hardest fought games that
has been played on Athletic ﬁeld
this year and brought to light a
number of nieti, who. wiili a little
coaching. would make valuable
acquisitions to the regular team.

Individually the sophomores
were superior to their opponents,
outplaying them iii nearly every
position.‘ Especially noticeable
was the woik of Crabbe and Mey
ers in their play against the op
posing guards. who from their ex
perience should have made the
center of the line invultlerable;
but they were opened up time and
again, allowing Peirce to go
through for good gains. \

At the ends Fisher and Mores
nlade many ﬁtletnckles and broke
up the intérferencc on every play,
At quarterback Brown and Mule
Ian were quick and reliable, mak-
ing only three tumbles in the en-
tire game. Spairldiiig behind
splendid interference never failed
to gain, several times dodging all
tackles until he reached tllc full-
back.

Of the juniors Haitles, Beyer
and Armstrong did the best work,
their defensive play preventing
the sophomores flom running up
a larger score than they did. ‘

The two fullrbacks bore the
brunt of the playing, doing most
at the advancing of the ball and
takirig'the bulk of the work on
defenstve Peirce backed up the
line in ﬁne style completely stopr
ping the attempts at line’bucking.
Both punted well and afforded
good interference for their halves.

Both teams were good in their
team play and formed their inter.
ferellce quickly and with good efc

fect.
The line up was as follows:

College during thesame year, and
a great many were classmates, and
the occasion was the means of
bringing about a sort of a class re-
union. The time was very pleas»
