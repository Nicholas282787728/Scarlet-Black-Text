Investigation by
, Impeachment

We, as newspeople, are reeling under the constant stream of
surprise developments in the Watergate investigation.

Before a thoughtful analysis of one development can be comples
ted, another completely unexpected event will make our work obs
solete -» before it ever leaves our typewriters

Wednesday’s White House revelation that two of the disputed
Presidential tapes had never existed was, in the words of his-
torian Joseph Wall, “just one more preposterous act in the whole
drama.”

Reaction throughout this area was stunned disbelief. And once
again, cries for impeachment were heard, rising again towards
and perhaps beyond the peak already reached.

And with these cries, it becomes evident that a short lesson in
Constitutional history and law may be in order

Unfortunately, many have become sloppy in their language, and
have begun to use “impeach" and "remove” interchangeably.
The words are not synonomous.

Impeachment is, basically, a vote by the United States House of
Representatives that a high government official be indicted for high
crimes or misdemeanors. It does not remove that official from
office. I

Rather, lit puts the official on trial before the Senate. where he is
either found guilty and removed from office, or acquitted.

If a President is on trial, the Senate hears the case with the Chief
Justice of the United States presiding.

Until quite recently, those considering impeachment were, in the
words of Congressman Ed Mezvinsky, thinking the unthinkable.
Now, it has become evident that impeachment proceedings may
be the only way to uncover the truth behind the mass of scandals
and corruption called Watergate. The “loss” of two crucial White
House tapes is only the latest piece of the puzzle which forces such
a conclusion.

Under the American system ofjustice, President Richard Nixon
must be considered innocent of high crimes and misdemeanors
hntil he is impeached by the House of Representatives and con-
,victed by the Senate. ‘

Senator Dick Clark said recently that, “Confidence in govern»
ment is a fragile item. It takes a long time to build, but it can be
destroyed relatively quickly. America cannot afford that. We need
the strength of our people to back us up when we act, on both dom-
esti’c and international fronts. The only way we can get that strene
gth is by trusting the people and givingth'em totally frank and honest
government.”

> We agree. The only way the truth will come out, and confidence
will be restored, is through an impeachment trial, which will allow
no more dissembling and no further evasion of justice.

National Impeachment Call

fEd. uote»-The editorial staff of the Grinnell Scarlet and Black
has endorsed the following national student editorial written by
the editors of the Amherst Student. It is reprinted here with the
caution that events since it was written October 22 have rendered
parts of it meaningless.)

Constitutional government in the United States may have been
suspended at 8:00 p.m. last Saturdaynight. Richard Nixon now rules
by fiat and force, He is no longer a legitimate leader.
, With callous disregard for' his oath of office and the intents of
congress and the Judiciary, the President first refused to abide
by a court order to produce Watergate documents. He then forced
the' resignation of the Attorney General and fired his Deputy
and the Watergate Special Prosecutor when they refused to condone
his conduct. Moreover, the President abolished the officeof Special
Prosecutor and dispatched the FBI to seal off their records.
These decisive and unprecedented actions represent the tactics
of a military coup. They are anathema to a rational democratic
policy.

Even before these steps were taken, public Confidence in the Nixon
Administration’s ability to govern was at one of its all~time lows.
Now this support will deteriorate still further. The mandate of
1972 has been buried in a legacy of illegality, hypocrisy and deceit
, When elected officials violate the sacred trust placed in them by
the people, the Constitution provides means for them to be impeached
and, if convicted, removed from office. These procedures are very
difficult to implement and are seldom used. But if ours were a
parliamentary system of government, the Nixon Administration
would have fallen months ago.

In the past, Mr. Nixon has cloaked his actions in a veil of legals
ity, but now he has bared his intentions to foresake rule by law.
The President must be impeached. No amount of legal double,
talk or political timidity can obscure this fact. The question of
his past culpability is almost moot. He is willing to maintain the
Watergate coverrup at any cost,

There is real question whether the Congress and the Judiciary
can force Richard Nixon to deal With them Within the confines of
the law. ‘But our actions, for the moment, must be based on this
premise. Members of the academic commilnity have a special
responsibility, They must articulate the principles which are at
stake. They must impress upon Congressmen and other national
leaders the gravity of the current situation and their duties under
the Constitution. Most importantly, they must communicate the

. strength of their convictions to the publifFafrlaf'gt-E and join With
' others in a nationwide struggle for the preservation of democratic
rule,

The methdos of response are numerous. Now more than ever, we
must write our Congressmen, The balance of mail over the next
few days will be crucial, Massive public expression of fliSSEnerIlO
matter what form it takes-us equally important.

The weeks ahead could represent either the redemption of Ameri-
can democracy or the prologue to its collapse. We remain silent at
our own peril.

McKibben: Tallest Stand

To the Editor:

I am running a Wrifedn campaign
for mayor of Grinnell against a
five-term i’ncumbent. Ithink [have
much to offer the city government,
which now commits itself to the
problems of the town as little as
possible, and too late.

I have several concrete proposals
designed to make a start on the
problems of this town; one of which
is housing. I propose to take alarge
portion of this community's bonding
capacity, or the amount of revenue
which we can safely derive from
issued bonds, to build lowerent housV
ing. I further favor a revision of
the building code to upgrade the
many substandard rental units In this
town.

I urge all of you to write in “Andy
McKibben” for mayor this Nov—
ember 6. All student may vote, and
no registration is requiredifanyone
has questions, comments, or any»
thing else to say to me, please call
me at 6-4061

distributed recently to a number of
student leaders. It is being reprinted
here at the request of its authors,
who wish their names withheld.)
T0 the Editors‘

Please take the time to read this. ,
If you don’t have the time now, put
it away and read it later. This lete
ter has two aspects. It is both a
confession of our guilt and a con-
demnation of others. In a recent
issue of the S & B, J. C. Woods
facitibusly accused our studentbody
0f ”ORAL SEX,”

SINGLE, a recently formed group
of students seriouslyconcerned with
this problem, realize that we have
been guilty of this charge. We hope
the following comments will pro-
voke fellow students to undertake
constructive action aimed at “norm
mallzlng” our liberal education at
Grinnell. Many feel that our educar
tion should be intensive both aca—
demically and socially.

We Claim that we want intimate
heterosexual interpersonal rela-
tionships. What prevents it then?
Certainly Grinnell students are caps
able of achieving almost any real-
lstic goal they set for themselves.
Single feels that this goal is not
unrealistic. One frequently hears
the argument that there is not en-
ough time to cultivate an intimate
emotional relationship. The acade-
mic pressure prohibits it. What

is the source of the acade-
mic pressure? It obviously origi—
nates internally. Stop and consider
how much of your time is spent of
unproductive activity. Instead of
talking about the paper you have to
start thinking about writing, go wr-
ite it, Instead of bitching to your
roommate that your desire for an
intimate relationship is not being
fulfilled, think of how you could at—
tempt to fulfill it.

Another observation/we Grinnellr
ians generally have a very high im—
age of ourselves. Some of us were
academic leaders, and others were
class presidents. Some have always
been able to pick and choose who
would fulfill their desires. We expect
others to come to us! After all,
we are important. It seems that
on one hand we desire opportunities
for developing intimate personal re-
lationships, but on the other hand,
we reject most possibilities be-
cause we think, “If I wait, someone
better may come along.” Is this
behavior self defeating”

If you have read this far, we thank
you for pulling up with our “preachr
ing” tone and once again urge you tn
take an active part in social selfr
determination.

The above have only been our bbr
servations, suggestions and ideas.

Normalized Grinnell Living

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

The worst of the newsprint crisis is over, at least for the Scarlet
and Black. But, we still have to make decisions almost hourly about
what will or will not be included in each issue.

We would like to hear from our readers _, as many of our readers

- as possible —- about what features they want to see in the Scarlet and

Black,‘ and what they feel should be omitted. ,

Although comments may be about anything in the paper, we are
particularly interested In your reaction to the following, either currr ,
ently included in the Scarlet and Black or under discussion for future

inclusion:
--Television program schedules
--Concert information
"Record reviews
--Book reviews
--A monthly magazine supplement

--Increased coverage of local news outside the campus
--Syndicated columns (like Ralph Nader)
Please take a minute to drop us a note. We can’t please everybody,

but we keep trying.

Crater: Disgusted With faculty

To the Editors,

The honorable Facultyofthis scho-
larly institution, through some Mo»
tive having seen fit, in its reiec-
tion of the Wall proposal, to contra—
dict every liberal Principle; to com-
promise the Respect, essential to
Education, Uf both Knowledge and
Reason; and hence sorely to dis
credit, not merely themselves, but
our very College as well, have
surely secured of at least one 507
rry Student the appropriate Disgust.

The overwhelming desire for a
Secret ballot proved well Justified;
for an opposing vdte could never
have been observed, but with Colin
tempt for the Narrow-Mindedness,
Cowardice, and unprincipled Expe-
dlency it must imply
This altruistic and wholly admire
able Proposal by Professor Wall
clearly meant nnthing more Radi-
cal, than simply entertaining the
question of student participation in
Decisions regarding their expensive
Education The Committee formed
would have surely done nothingmore
Revolutionary, than seek Answers,
and in turn Educate the College
community of its Findings. Its de-
clslons would FarcenDAction, cdmr

This poem sums up my feelings on

Time has brought you,
This College Should be praised.

Costs have sought you,
They have taught you,
Grinnell College wants board raised.
Eat hearty!
