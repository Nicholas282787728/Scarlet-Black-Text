ANNUAL REPORTS.
At last

Thursday evening reports

the men's meeting

were
given by the retiring ofﬁcers and

chairmen, The reports showed

the Assocration in as prosperous
a condition as has been its state
tor at least one college generation.
While the membership has re-
mained about the same as last
year, the reportsshoived adccided
increase in the attendance at the
weekly prayer meetings and the
Bible and mission classes. It the
ﬁnancial reports may be taken as
a thermometer there is reason to
be satisﬁed with the condition.
The report given by the treasurer
is a follows:

the report of the lecture course
committee,which follows. While
the balance is in our favor. yet it
is a matter of regret that the
course ot this year has not paid
for itself. The reasons given for
its not doing so were: it) greater
expenses than usual outside oi
that for talent. (2) An uu-
tortunate opening number. (3)
No tailure ot a number to appear
as was a favorable occnrnnce tlle
previous year. (At) Decrease in
cash sales, and (5) decrease in
the number of season tickets sold.
which makes it clear that the
lecture course is losing its popu-
larity, at least tor this year, [Are
sumably due to the fact that
numerous other entertainments
are drawing the interest of the
public.
