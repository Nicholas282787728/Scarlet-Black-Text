Talents range from singing to composmg

Singers, musicians strike notes of diversity

By Ncetn Sirur
andJustiIIe Doherty

Despite the relatively small size
of the music department at
Grinnell, there is no dearth of
musical talent within the student
body of the college. Naturally,
student: interests are not confined
to any one area of music, and there
is a wide variety of concerts and
impromptu performances, ranging
from folk and gospel to jazz and
classical.

The ”Grinnell Singers" and the
Grinnell College Chorus are
perhaps the two most structured
musical groups here. The Singers
perform mostly madrigals and
vocal chamber music, while the
Chorus concentrates more on
music written for large choruses,

SUE Farrier, who is considered
.one of the better singers on cam»

the West Tennessee chorus,

Since then, Wilson's singing
experiences have been at Grinnell,
ahd she feels that she has received
a great deal of encouragement
from Mr. James Fudge, a
professor in the music department,
“who has given me a lot oi op
portunities to sing.” Wilson has
sung in opera workshops since her
freshman year and also sang
“Porgy and Bess” with Leonard
Burkes in Herrick Chapel during
Parent’s Weekend.

DESPITE these at:-
complishments, Wilson still feels
that she is in an “exploratory
stage” and wants to “master
singing." She likes singing in
public because “it’s always real
special to me to feel the respon-
siveness of the audience, the
feeling other people appreciate

“Singing gives you an intimacy

with people in which they can

spill out how they’re

reacting to the music. ”

it is “a very ﬂuid group that
changes every semester.” He is
primarily an organ player,
although he currently plays bass
recorder and keyboards for the
Collegium.

pus, is a member of both groups.
Farrier has been in church and
school choirs since fifth grade and
periormed before middleesized
audiences in high school. Ac-
cording to Farrier, there is "more
opportunity to do solos, duets,
trips. etc. here than at a large
college, and the atmosphere in the
music department is friendly, but
professional.”

Although Farrier has not
seriously considered a career in

what you are doing and want you to
‘know it.” Wilson added that
she would "never limit herself to
any one genre of music because
there's so much to learn about it."

Besides opera and contemporary
music, Wilson also sings gospel
with the Young, Gifted and Black

Choir. Her family has “always
been really active in singing” and

she feels that her talent is “a sort
of hereditary thing that comes
down."

“It’s always real special to me to
feel the responsiveness of the
audience, the feeling other
people appreciate what you’re
doing and want you to lenow it.”

music, she makes time lor chorps
because she “loves to sing.” She
feels that her voice is more (on,
ducive to classical music, but also
enjoys soft rock, and would
welcome an opportunity to test her
talent in that area Farrier
rehearses for approxullalelv Slx
hours per week with the Slligels
and the Chorus, but does nol have
to put in much extra time learning
the music, since she has a good
memory.

"AHEN Rose Wilson. a

ciology major, also sings in the
Grinnell Chorus. She is a soprano
and has sung in public since her
senior year in high school. Wilson
has also had formal voice training
at Memphis State University
before coming to Grinnell. She has
been in church choirs as well as in

GREG Richardson, who sings
with the Grinnell Chorus, was also
a member of the Young, Gifted
and Black Choir until recently.
Although Richardson believes that
the gospel singers are “a very good
group,” he quit becausc he felt
“that everyone was not dedicated
enough ” lie was disillusioned with
the choir when (on one occasion)
“only three people showed up at
rehearsal.” ticha son, a fresh-
man from H sburg, Penn
sylvania, sang in a couple of rock
groups and In school and church
Choirs before comma to Grinnell.

John Burrows is a member of the
Collegium Musicum. which ls an
organization of small perlormance
groups at vocal, instrumental, and
mixed music. Playing mostly
Baroque music, Burrows feels that

Grinnell has some drawbacks n
that “the music department is
small, and there is no one to really
teach organ." However, he makes
the point that at a larger school he
“may not have had access to a high
quality 'organ like the one in
Herrick." He also realizes that as a
non-music major, he would not
have had as many opportunities to
give recitals. Burrows has a major
recital coming up a week from
today in Herrick Chapel.

Singer and guitarist Peter Young
has developed his art mostly on his
own. Aside from a year and a half
of guitar lessons, he has had
practi ally no formal training,
acqui ng most of his knowledge
from friends and experience.
Before coming to Grinnell,
Young's performing experience
was restricted to a few benefit
concerts in the Chicago area. His
forte is popular folk music and he
performs with the Scarleteers and
Tanagers as well as semi-regularly
at the Longhorn.

YOUNG feels that there is a “lot
of opportunity to play at informal
getrtogethers as well as at
organized concerts on campus. He
notes that “there is an incredible
number of people with different
tastes who play here,” adding that
“Grinnell can be a very exciting
place for musicians to be.”

Performing at the Longhorn
allows “communication with the
townspeople on a level you don't
usually get as a student.” singing
gives you an intimacy with people
in which they can spill out how
they’re reacting to the music.“

SINCE he’s been at Grinnell,
Young has seen his tastes
widening Recently he has taken up

classical guitar.which he describes _

as both
frustrating . ,

While known for his popular folk
sound, Young confesses/‘1 enjoy a
lot of off-beat people. such as Jerry
Jeff Walker and John Prine. It’s
kind of fun to turn people on to
singers they might not have heard

otherwise." . t .

' CONCERNING the future,
Young says a music career in»
trigues him and promises that
“I’ll keep playing. it I get lucky. of
course, I’ll go on, but i realize the
competition involved and am very
realich about it.“ For now, Young
is pleased that Grinnell has given
him "thousands of opportunltles to
play.”

Considered one of the most
outstanding musicians on campus,
Kevin Zoemig concentrates on

Zoernig has studied piano since he
was five years old and has
mastered it well enough to give 16
lessons weekly to college studenb.

CURRENTLY, Zoerning is the
musical director of the upcoming
theater production, Peer Gynt.
He has composed a complete
musical score for the play. He is
also part of a jazz ensemble.

A music major, Zoemig plans to
“have a career in some area of
music.” He hopes it will be in
composing. Along with his ex;
perience with “Peer Gynt," he has
had the opportunity to compose
and play classical, jazz and rock
pieces.

HE feels that although the music
department here is fine, ”it is not
designed for music majors per se,”
and he regrets the lack of come

Zoernig has also been studying
piano tuning and repairing and
hopes to restore an old, dilapidated
Steiner piano which was given to
him by the college.

BLAIR Martin plays Vibraphone

perlorming experience before
coming to Grinnell, He has played
mallets since he was eight years
old. Along with playing in a jazz
band, he has periormed in the
United States band, which is a
group of college and high school
students that represent the U.S. in
different parts oi the world. .

He enjoys the jazz band and feels
that “Mr. Jensen is a fine con-
ductor who adds a lot of en-
thusiasm to the group.” Martin
likes playing to both large and
small audiences and improvising
on stage.

ALSO a music major, Martin
believes that by being at Grinnell,
he is able to have more ops
portunities to perform, but is
concerned that there is no one on
the faculty here who can instruct
him in his instrument.

talented student was presented
