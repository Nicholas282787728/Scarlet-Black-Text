1a is not so widely known
ar'nong the students as it should
be, that on next Friday and Sat
urday the State Tennis Tourna-
ment will be held in Grinnell.
Teams from S. U. 1., Cornell and
Penn will be present, and the cone
test for ﬁrst place promises to be
exceedingly inteiesting. S. U. I.
has recently held a handicap
tennis tournament in which over
seventy men took part, while the
“Cornellian” in a recent editorial
speaks highly oi the ability ot the
men who are to represent Cornell.
Not so much is known of Penn‘s
representatives, but asthey won
ﬁrst place in singles last year and
came uncomfortably close to win-
ning the doubles, they may be re-
garded as dangerous competitors
this year. Hard work has been
done on our own home courts
whenever the weather permitted,
and every effort 15 being made to
turn out a winning team. For the
last two or three years Grinnell
has secured either one or both the
championships and it is hoped
that it can keep up this good
record. The preliminaries ofthe
tournament will be played Friday.
and the ﬁnals Saturday morning.
All the matches promise to be
close and interesting, and it is to
be hoped that the players may re-
ceive the support of good attend-
ance on the part of the students.

THE ATTITUDE which was taken
by the students in regard to the
honor system at the mass meet-
ing held last Tuesday evening, is
highly commendable. l-lardly
anyone had anthiugto say against
the theory of the system, but laid
all their charges to the practical
working of it. Since this was the
case, it was interesting to hear
from those who have been in
college since the adoption of the
honor system. The opinion of
such ones that under the
system there had been less dis-
honesty in examinations titan
there had been previously and al-
though the student council had
had but few cases come before it.
yet the system had worked admire
ably as a preventative. The
amendments to the constitution
which were presented by the
council, are destined to strengthen
the system and make it more
ettective. The principal ohjccr of
the meetingwas to let the students

the past two years express their
opinions in regard to the system.
as well as to learn what the atti»
tude of the older students was in
respect to it. When all the
students come to feel that the
sentiment of the student body is
distinctly opposed to dishonesty
in examinations, there will be but
few cases to be dealt with.

Calocagaihia welcomed asguests
Friday afternoon the members of
the Ellis and E. B. B. socteties.
who were invited to hear Mrs.
Gates talk to the girls, Opening
the program Christine Kendrick
played a waltz by Heller, and as
an encore, Narcissus by Nevin.
Both were very much enjoyed.
Mrs. Gates read and enlarged up
on some extracts from Hamlin
ion Mabie's great lecture “Literr
attire as a Personal Resource,” A
few of the thoughts were: A lim-
ited number dfbookslive through
the ages, but the great majority
perish in a few years. The mase
tcr peices live on as an eternal ins
spiration to men. Many great
men as Geothe have been awaits
ened to new life by literature
Constant companionship with a
book is necessary to get an inspir
ration from it. Great men and
women never grow old. as Glade
stone, and Lowell who called llime
self “Incurably young.” Homer
is one of the great antiseptics of
life. and literature. The only
thing large enough to cover the
Odyssey is thesky. Americans
are lacking in depths of life
Most of its live in one room when
we should live in a palace. Thus
wt: narrow ourselves down to the
commonplace. Idealism will nev-
er be destroyed so long as there

are fair faces and holy lives. Cal-
ocagathia and their friends are
very grateful to Mrs. Gates for
her inspiring talk and wish that
they might hear her nime olten
Next Friday the program will be
a mock trial.
