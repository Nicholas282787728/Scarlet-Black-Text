BE FAIR WITH YOURSELF

Almost every Grinucll student has read ar-
ticlcs lamenting the average college ginduatc’s
lack of knowledge of the world today. College, to
fit hiln properly for his place ill life, should fill
that transitory period between the protection of
the home and the rigors of earning As long as it
permits llinl no discrimination this IS not possible.

Grinllcll students are faced with the probabil»
ity of making it less possible for Grinllell college
to properly fill that transitory period here. The
student should retain, individually, the right to
purchase what he desires and reject that for which
he does not care to spend his money. Responsibilr
it)‘ on this score, little tllougll it may be, helps to
fit him fol is later life.

Ill addition to that, heads of student organiz-
ations can scarcely be harmed by a venture in
business. Sooner or later they are going to run
into a world where there are no gllﬂt‘ﬂnleesillo
“gravy.” That is just what circulation is to a
student publication if it is prearranged so that no
effort is required to obtain it.

From a business standpoint it would be a good
thing for The Scarlet and Black to seek subscripr
tions by placing the payment on the college bill.
But The Scarlet and Black sees no rcason for
' - 'llg itself on students who do not want it. And
it proud of being able to stand independently
on its own feet without subsidntioll. The Cyclone,
it has bccn shown by figures in today’s paper, alld
those welcome challenging, can stand alone and put
out just as good a publication without forcing its
self on ally student who docs not care to take it.

If it is fair to make the student buy a Cyclone,
it is just as fair to make him buy a certain number
of hot dogs at a football game, to make him pay
for dances, or to purchase a homecoming program.
One of the women loading ill the campaign to but
the Cyclone on the college bill confessed yesterday
that she would “kick like the dickcns” if an of-
fort wcrc made to compel students to pay a dance
fee.

It may not strike you this time. You may blly
a Cyclone anyway. But don’t forget that ally rc-
dllction which comes to you that way. is being
taken ollt of the pockets of those who do not want
what you are forcing thclll to buy. Sooner or later
it will strike home for you and your finances will
be paying for what someone else wants. The stu-
dent should be required to buy only what he
actually needs. VOTE AGAINST COMPULSORY
SUBSCRIPTION TO TILE CYCLONE.

)lally studcnts, on the verge of: Thursday’s
\‘otc regarding compulsory yearbooks, seem to
havc tllc impression that the Cyclone cannot cone
tinllc without subsidation. The source of this llllr
pl‘cssion, is immaterial. but the fact remains that
the C 'clonc is HOT on the verge of bankruptcy.

Consider the figure, ill the matter. Already
272 books have been cilller sold or promised acr
cording to Fillmore Gwynlle-Vaughall’s estimate.
Allowing for 28 frcc books to staff lllclnbers, it
would require 300 to be printed. Costs ill putting
these out. are divided into thrcc classes—printing,
engraving, and miscellaneous.

Tllc printing contract is set at $1600 for GOO
books. \Vith only half as many books being print-
cd, it s not fair to expect :l 50 per cent reduction.
But 3-) per cent certainly can he expected and that
would put printing costs at $1010, Engraving
costs may be estimated at $800, which is $84 more
than they were last year. Miscellaneous may rca-
sonnbly be set at $200, also more than in 1930-31.

should it, ill a period when more students than cvcr
before are trying to get through college on a mini-
lnum cost, force itself on those who do not wish to
buy!

That the Cyclone did not pay last ycar is no
secret. But it was not bccausc it could not have
done so under the contracts and expenscs. It lost
money only because of a misunderstanding of what
tilkcn by thc Cyclone management to ho all order
for it large number of books. This resulted in a
surplus of more than 100 books. Subsidatiou of
the, yearbook provides no excuse for making it
compulsory. VOTE AGAINST COMPULSORY
SUBSCRIPTION TO THE CYCLONE. \

CONSISTENCY?

Grillncll spirit: Manufacturing jobs to keep
students in college and then forcing them to buy
yearbooks which they neither llcod llor desirc
simply because a majority of studcnts may ‘votc in
that way. .

Grinllcll college this year is providing more
men with employment than over before. Ninclyr
four men are now listed on collcge hoard jobs as
compared with 86 last year. Comparative figures
on women employed were not available today, but
it seems safe to assume that proportion of in
crcasc would be about the samc. The fact that
the office of the (lean of men soncs as a central
clearing house on jobs given out makes possible
the sccurillg of figures on men clnploycd.

Tho Scarlet and Black today car . '| story
from the officc of Sllcltou L. Boatty. ill which the
dean says that. need for nil-they clllploylllpilt coll-
tiuues. He seeks odd jobs for about 15 man who
are almost entirely dcpclldcut upon thcsc for in-
cidental expenses.

A C. no is certainly to be classed as inci-
ilclltal cllsc.
Cyclone uill lilakc it cvcll more difficult for our
ploycd inch to conserve tllcir luiuls by going with
out articles for which they have no urgent need.

7G;—
PUBLICITY J USTIFIED

The Scarlet and Black h
issue to bring out both sides of the question of
including the purchase of a. yearbook in the collcgc
hill. Tllc news story on the election is unbiased and
editorial opinion is given on both sides of the ques-
tioll, with a preponderance of material opposing
such a more since it appcars to the editor that
there are many reasons why it should not pass.
Incidentally, this same view will hold whenever
an effort is made to compel the studcnt to pun
Chase an object for which he may have no use.

Many things have been disclosed ill today’s
Scarlet and Black which wcrc not disclosed in the
meeting of the Student council Sunday. Chief

among these are the figurcs which show that the

Cyclone, lm‘thout selling any books in addition to
“lose already sold or promised, would better than
break even. Publicity on this matter can do no
harm.

It is not hard to understand that somc stu-
dent i-eprcsclltativcs nliigllt havo felt that the inat-
tcr was self evident, and did not desire to see a
vote postponed until aftcr figures had bccn inr
l‘estigated and placed before the students. That
they crrcd is now obvious. There w . incthillg
nlorc to he brought out. If this offal) scrvcs to
prevent rushing future discussions to student votc
wthout securing dcfillitc figures on thc matter, it
will have been valuable.

IF' THIS BE POLITICS

It is only fair to warn students that men and
women interested ill putting tllc Cyclone on the
scmestcl- fee will how all organized group operatr
lug ill dormitories and quadrangle wllcn the cloc-
tion is held Thursday night. chrcscutativcs will
be on hand to allsll'cr all questions by giving- the
plan a favorable uspeot if that is possiblc.

Naturally, this increases thc pos bility of
passage of the scmcstcr fcc arrallgcmcllt, Possibly
that is the reason that a slchcstion that vote be
held ill all allecollcgc convocation .did not moot
with approval of those rcprcscntntivcs. They foal:
cd open and unbiased discussion.

Students who are open minded on the (pics
tion will do Well to use thc arguments on both sides
published in today ’s Scarlet and Black as a guide.
The editorial in favor of the plan was written by
students who favor its passage and should include
all arguments on that sidc. Yet it noticeably avoids
certain issues. Ask men and \\ omen favoring the
plan about these tomorrow night.

Dean of Men’s Office Helps
With Student Aid Appeals

Total aid at Grlnucll college this
year has been extended to include a
larger number of applicants than
heretofore by the establishment of a
central clearing house connection
through the office of Shelton L.
Beatty, dean,of men, Various depart
ments retain the individual problem
of giving‘out positions, however.

Ninetyrfour men have regular col-
lege board jobs, so full bosrd and
44 hslr boom. Fifty-one men are on
the substitute and odd jobs lists.
Eighteen men are earning their room
in town homes. and 12 are given cm-
ployment in stores, homes, and busi-
ness houses.

“Although the need [or employ—
ment has been acute,“ said Mr. Bent-
ty today, “the town and college co-
operating have been able to take care
of every urgent need at present,
though need for further employment
continues. and jobs ere needed bud-
1y for incidental expenses of some 15
men who are almost. entirely depend-
ent upon such resources."
