In the late fall of 1959 the
second edition of the Gl‘innell
Review was distributed (or the
first time this year to its sub—
scription holders on campus.

There are many things that

First then, i would like to
compliment the staii, and
particularly, i suppose, Miss
Ellison, on the quality oi the
publication irom a purely
technical standpoint. They
have produced a review oi

taken ior granted layout at
the magazine.

The innovation
art along with stories. poetry
and critical and scholarly ar-
ticles is cspccially noteworthy.
Miss Fetersllie’s woodcuts are
not only accomplishments in
themselves but do much to add
a certain sophistication to the
publication.

Turning now to the writing
itself, I have chosen two con-
tributions which seemed \vor-
