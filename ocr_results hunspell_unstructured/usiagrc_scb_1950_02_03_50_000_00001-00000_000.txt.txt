Leaders Review Student Frog—ress

 

'tevens Explodes ‘Sky Pie’ Myth

As Peisner Stresses Cooperation

 

“When cooperation exists, it
gets little attention; when it
does not exist, it stands out like
a sore thumb,” said Earl Peis—
her, student council president,
in convocation yesterday morn-
ing.

Peisner gave a joke sprinkled
report of the Newton leadership
conference last weekend, touch-
ing six main highlights of the
discussions.

He preceded President Sam-,
uel N, Stevens on the program.
Dr. Stevens told the students
that there is no pie in the sky,
that there cannot be freedom
Without discipline, and that there
cannot begood institutional life
Without responsibility. By pie
in the sky he was referring to
idealized hope of things to be
obtained without working for
them.

In his report on the confer-
ence, Peisner touched these
main points:

1. Plans to lower the cost of
the Cyclone to the students

2. Recommendations concern-
ing the policy of the Slim

3. Recommendations for set-
ting up a student educational
policies committee

5. Proposals for a change in
the student council constitution
to provide a new director of
social affairs

6. Need for $3,324 more to
finance the four displaced stu-
dents now on the campus for
their four—years education

C of HP Discusses

Hall Election Revision

The C.ofH.P this week took
up the question of infringe-
ments on the dining-room rules.
It was noticed that an increas«
ing number of men were ap-
pearing for the evening meal
in jeans, and that many men
have recently neglected to put
on ties. The C. of H. P. feels
that people are getting more
and more careless about these
rules. and that a little cleaning
up would brighten things up.
You don’t have to be dressed
up in a dinner jacket, but at
least look presentable, council—
men suggest.

The C. of H. P. is also Con-
sidering a revision in the 9196s
tion of hall officers. Under the
projected change, sophomores
would become eligible in the
spring for the position of hall
vice president. No decisions on
the matter have as yet been
reached, but the new Change is
considered a possibility.

Dining Room Rules/

By Claude Noyes

Last week end, while we
humble ones were happily ca-
rousing at home, campus leaders
met in Newton to review the
events of the past semester, and
to further the motif of “huge
success" enunciated in the last
5 & B.

Convening Sunday morning,
the student leadership Confer-
ence listened to detailed reports
on four main topics of Grinnell
life, and then considered them
in succession as a committee of
the Whole. The whole conference
was guided by President of the
c. of H. P. Charles Harpole.

Stu Roeder. Chairman of
Gadabouts, discussed the real-4
ganization of student social ad—
‘ministration. He described the
present organization, and pro-
posed a centralization of auth—
ority. Suggested was a central
five—man Social Co—ordinating
Committee, with four members
to supervise each of the four
main aspects of social adminis-
tration. The fifth member would
be chairman of the group, and
co ordinat‘e the whole.

The question of publications
was analyzed by Dick Berkley.
He presented various technical
objections to the present form
of the s & B. He also suggested
that the Cyclone be subsidized
by the Board of Publications, if
money can be found.

Finances were discussed by
Nancy Wolfe. She laid emphasis
on the problem of finding mon-
ey for the Cyclone, and made it
clear that the problem is one
of alternate sacrifice, of choos-
ing activities to which money
must be refused.

Earl Peisner discussed aca—
demic problems, He suggested
that there be a committee of
students to present to the fac-
ulty the opinion of the st dents
on the one-hour versus the
threesl'iou!‘ exam system.

The conference adjourned late
Sunday evening with a game of
Charades.

Monday was spent in discuss—
ing the problem of paying the
way of DPs at present on cam-
pus, and in summarizing the
resolutions of the conference.
