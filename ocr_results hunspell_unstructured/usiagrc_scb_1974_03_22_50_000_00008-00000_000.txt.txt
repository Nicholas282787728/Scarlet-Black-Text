Indoor track ior this year tiiish-
ed Monday evening at the PEG,
as Grinnell placed iourth in a seven
team tield in the Grinnell ltlvitae

‘tional. Wartburg edged the William
Penn Track Club 47 to 45-1/2 to
take the meet. Next. at 29 points,

,was Central, iollowed by Gi-innell
23, Cornell 15, Simpson'la—l/z,
and Luther 6. It was the ﬁfth in—
door track meet in a season in

. which the Pioneers have never pl—
aced last, but have also nevcrtop-
‘ped the iield.

the distance events. Adistancemed»

Field events continue to hurt the
Pioneers. With‘nobody from Grin,

Loose Hall has won it all! The
men from Loose showed Younkers
a little South Campus finesse (that’s
about all there is of it) as they
rolled over them by a lopsided see
ore of 80—52. Faithful followers of
these regular articles may wonder
why Younkers was in the iinals in—
stead Of Dibble/Cowles who was
predicted to encounter the Loose
squad, Well, i gooted. I listened
to my heart instead oi my head,
a not all too uncommon phenomenv
on tor me There is no place ior
sentiment in responsiblejournalisni
So we'll make this artlcie as ire
responsible as possible, another
not all too uncommon phenomenon.
Younkers knocked off Langan/Smr
ith, the only team to ever deieat
Loose, ill the first round of the
playotts, 40730. Balanced scoring
marked the Younker team effort.
Dibble/Cowles edged naighbor Cl»
ark, 49-46, with three of the vic-
tors getting into double tigures, Gr-
eg Fallon’s magic iingers dropped
in 32 points as Off Campus ousted
Main/Mears, 57751. Three Loose
players scored more than 15 poi-
nts apiece in their easy romp over
a tired bunch of Profs, 75-33.

In the North and South Division
championship Younkers upset fave
ored D/C, 50-33, and regained a
semblance oi respect aiter their
pasting in the 1M iootball Champv
ionship game by D/C. Bob Arnold
led Younkers and all scorers with
20 points. In the showdown between

Fallon outscored his highrscoring
brother by 6 points.

Loose completely dominated Yo-
unkers in the title game. They con»
trolled the boards, they turned turn-
overs and bad shots, and were genr
erally unstoppable on ottense. By
the end oi the iirst hali Loose had
a commanding 22 point lead. The
highlight ior Younkers in the iirst
hall was when Keith Fawcett lost
his contact lensesl Loose eventually
triumphed by 28 points, 30-52. Loose
had tour men in double iigures, led

HIGH JUMP

by John Williams 21 points. There
were 44 tonls called duringthe game,
an untortunate reilection upon the
whole 1M basketball season this
year.

Thanks to Jim Bogart’s large ex-
penditures of time and energy the
1M basketball season was able to
be concluded despite the generally
bellicose characters oi the players,
it would be nice to conclude my ar-
ticle with a nice cliche like a fun
time was had by all, but that would
be lying.
