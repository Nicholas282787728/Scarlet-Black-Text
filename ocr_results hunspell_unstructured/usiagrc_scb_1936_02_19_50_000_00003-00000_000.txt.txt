Final Outcome to Dependl
on Saturday’s Games

As the final week in the men's.
intramural basketball season be-;
gins an analysis of the standings'
reveals that in one league the race
is becoming a free-for—all. while in
the other, the B, one team is stag-
ing a runaway.

However, when the standings of
‘each hall's teams in the respective
leagues are combined into one, it
becomes apparent that the result
will not be known until after the
final gun.

(hues, Langan Tied

The combined standings show
that two balls. Gates and Langsn,
are tied for the top berth, each
having annexed a total of five
wins and three defeats. Smith
and Clark follow with four victor.,
ies and four deefats to make 'stllli
another tie, while the remaining
two teams, Rawsoll and Dibble,
are tied for the basement with
three victories and five defeats.

With this state of affairs the
final results of’the intramural race
will not be known until Saturday.
In one of the matches Smith and‘
Langan meet, and should the
southenders w-in both games, the
final standing for that hall would
be six won and four lost, Langan, i
on the other hand. would finish the
season with an even break, five
wins and five losses. A split in
this series would result in Langan
finishing the season with six won;
and four lost, and Smith with a
.500 percent. record.

Gates Gould \vin

Continuing the ifing, should
Langan split Saturday morning, i
and Gates capture both tilts, then
Gates would take the race. In case
Langan wins both, then Gates can
achieve a tie by doing likewise A
double loss by Langan, on the
other hand, and a single victoryl
by Gates will give the trophy to'
Gates.

Another possible outcome of the
race would be a three—way tie be-
tween Gates, ‘Clark, and Smith.
Should Clark heat Dibble twice,

Gates and Rawson split even, and
Smith down Langan twice, the
standing of these teams would be
six victories and four defeats,
each.

Possibil' oi Three Way Tier

A three way he can also be El
ated through the following situa—
tion: Gates and Langan each
break even, and Clark win two
in that event the final
standings again would be six vic-
tories and four defeats each,

If Gates and Clark each break
even, and Smith wins two, then a
two-way tie- between Gates and

‘Smith would be created.

A second possibility for a two
way tie could be brought about as
follows: Langah would split even
with Smith. This would give Lan-
gsn a standing of six victornes and
four losses. Rawson would trip
Gates twice. This would give each
of these teams a five hundred rat-
ing. Clark would have to win
both tilts from the Dibble teams,
This would give a rating of six
victories and four losses, and put
Clerk in a tie with Langan for the
trophy.

Harold callaway, student coach.

‘The experience wc gained from
our defeat at Des Moines has
proved valuable to us,” Callaway
said. "We have been able to corn
,rect the riding to a great extent,
which was our greatest fault at
the first of the season."

The Grinnell squad has been
strengthened by the addi on of
Fergus Kenyon in the 135—pound
class. Kenyon has become eli
ble through the new ruling that
transfers from junior colleges may
participate in varsity sports after
one semester‘s residence at the
new school.
