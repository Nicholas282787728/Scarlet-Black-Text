as possible. in lheir opinion. rhc hcsl
inieresis oi ihc college deniaud lhal lhe
head oi lhe insriliilioii he not handicnpe
ped as Aciing Presidenl Main now is.
The majority oi lhe iricnds oi lhe col-
lege, we believe, will concur in ihisopiii-
ion. Allhough ihore is a widespread
belief that the outlook [or {he College at
lhe present linie is hiighler lhan Eva/hes
iore.and lhal ihe aciairs oi lhe college
are, perhaps, in beiler coiidilion ihaii al
any lime in ils previous hislory. yer ii is
generally believed ihala regularly inauge
ureled presidenl, iinhainperod by class
room work and iree lo devole his whole
attention lo lhe needs oi ilie college, will
be able in improve upon lhe preseiil sal-
isiaciory condiiions. .

ll is lhe belief of many lhal our hopes
in lhis direclion will soon be realized.
Whelher or nol ihis beliei has a sound
iouiidalion cannol be iold, biil ir is high,
ly improbable lhal any great lapse oi
lirne will occur bciore lhe seleclion is
made. The mCrClhoughl ihnliiwill no

occur soon, call iividly lo mind lhe iacl

and already has alluined a posillon lo
which'oihers have been aspiring ior
years. ,

Ihe ediicalional ideal ihal has been
se'l up ior ilie college, or ii nor ilie ideal
ilseli. lhe allainnieni loivard lhnl ideal is
higher lhan rlial oiaiiy olher college in

can only be undersiood by a iull lecogs
nilion oiwhal hasiusl been said. I: is
difﬁcult lo see how any college could
have a highcr educational Ideal than (he
one toward which Grinnell has been
sleadily growing.

The ideal ironi iho nioral slandpoinl,
\hough perhaps nol realized io ihe sanie
