MUSEH WHITES ABﬂllT
THIP THROUGH EGYPT

Maser and Mathews Teaching In
American School In
Cairo, Egypt.

A letter trom Earl Maser, '20, who
with Roderick Matthews, '20, is teach
mg the American University at Cairo,
Egypt,‘was received on the campus
yesterday it contains an interesting
account or the trip to Egypt The late
ter, in part, follows:

"it occurred to me last night that
6000 miles away, in Grlnnell, the an—
nual general reception was being held.
That thought carried me, in memory,
back to last year's general, and three
other generals, and society mixes,
torchlight parades, pep meetings, and
everything else that goes with the
opening of school at Grinnell.

In England Three Weeks

“it would tahe too long for me to
tell all about our trip over, so 1 shall
give ynu the barest skeleton of it, We
landed at Liverpool August 1, and
found that 17 days in England was
our good fortune During those 17
days i visited Stratford on Avon, 0x-
tord, London, and the English lake
district (Wordsworth‘s home). We
left Liverpool August 17, on the "Lan-
cashire" a Bibby line boat. it you
ever expect to travel first class on an
English boat, be sure to own a dress
suit or at least a dinner coat Every
Englishman of any standing at all
dresses for dinner. We went through
the straits of Gibraltar, spent two
days at Marseilles, past the volcano
Stromboli, down through the straits
between ltaly and Sicily, and arrived
at Port Said on August 31.

Our school Work begins October 5.
My schedule calls for 17 hours ot Eng—
lish and 3 hours at arithmetic. The
'first year we shall have 14 men on
the faculty—7 Americans and 7 nan
lives The student may choose be-
tween instruction in Arabic or Eng-
lish. This year only the tirst two
classes will be had, and enrollment is
limited to 150. Now we have only a
college of arts and science, but later.
expansion into a university with
schools of medicine, religion, law, etc
is planned, My belief is that this will
he a 'big institution some day and I
consider myself fortunate to he con
nected with it at the beginning.

1 have seen the pyramids and
sphinx and was duly impressed with
both. There is something fascinating
and inexplicable about the Sphinx. 1t
crouches there in the sand gazing
across the valley ot the Nile, into the
desert beyond, with eyes fixed on
something hundreds or miles to the
eastward, and one actually comes un.
der the impression that the thing is
alive, that it is patiently waiting for
something out there in the land or the
rising sun. Tradition says that Na~
Deleon‘s soldiers shot all the nose—
anyway, it is gone, The car is about
6 feet in length, so you can get an

idea of 1.11; Size.”

could get them to their homes in the
vicinity or Petrograd.

“lllaior Lyons had gone part way
toward Petlogrdd to arrange for
transpon ation on the Trans- Sibelian
load, but was called bzwk when it was
decided to send them by sea. It was
necessary for these children in order
to reach Petrograd, to go by the way
of Sim Francisco and the Panama

:Canal.

Siberiit Deslituto
"The people of Siberia are destitute
and most of them ignorant and illit-
erate. The cultured class of Russians

,are Lhe ones who have suffered the

most, for the soviet government has
taken away from them their homes
and possessions and they are incapa-
ble or supporting themselves.

"The Soviet government has appror
primed for state use all property,
practically stopping all manufacture
and industry. There is no gold or le
ver left in the country and paper
money is almost worthless.

"Siberia, with all its great possibil—
ities for agriculture and industry has
no outlook for development until a
stable government, is established, and
according to Major Lyons, it is imDOSA
sible tor anyone to predict what will
be the outcome oi: the unrest and dis-
order which now reigns in Russia and
Siberia.”

weeks and have had ample time to
plan a meeting with some suggestions
to start things moving.

The present freshman class is one
or the largest in the history of the
college. Well developed talent along
all lines has already been discovered.
We are expecting this class to do
some really notable things

Perhaps it the class got together on
a picnic or some social function where
their was no formality and persons
could come to know each other better
something could get started. There
are innumerable things that could be
worked out. Perhaps the “Howling
Hundred" would welcome a little coma
petition at the games. This is only
a suggestion or what the class might
think out tor themselves.‘

A FRESHMAN.

Why do we go to Chapel? Do we
go for the purpose or hearing what
the speaker has to say, or do we go
there to get our lessons? The Chapel
building is limited in seating capacity
this year and there are plenty or other

places on the campus where studying
can be done.

If one sits in the back row of the
chapel, almost any morning he can see
the students in front of him drawing
pictures of the chapel windows, writ—
ing letters, or getting their lessons
which they have not taken time to
prepare at the proper hour. One does
not only injure himselt by so doing.
but he distracts the attention of the
Dersons sitting around him. He can—
not read a book without turning the
leaves and that makes a noise, ale
though slight, still distracting.

Tuesday morning, when “Dad" Elli-
ott was giving his splcndid address,
not only those sitting near the back
of the room, but students in various
parts or the room, sat with their books
or notebooks open and their heads
bent over them. This does not show
respect to the speaker nor does it ben-

efit the student.

This is not the only disturbance
that is had in the chapel hour. Very
often, someone forgets his surround—
ings and, having thought of something
which he wishes to impart to his
neighbor, he proceeds to whisper, to
the annoyance of the others These

acts are nothing more than thought-
lessness on the part or the guilty, so
let us remind ourselves that the
chapel hour is the time to get some
help along our spiritual life, and to
learn things which We do not get
from books alone.
