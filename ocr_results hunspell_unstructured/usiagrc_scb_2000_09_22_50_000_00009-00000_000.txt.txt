Another abolition: advertising

President Lincoln gave his noted proclamav
tion 160 years ago, and we are still waiting to be
free. The movement to abolish the death penalty
in the United States' is growing, and' itseems only
a matter oftime (though it may be a long time)
before it is successful. But the cages around us
are many, and it will take more than a single hacks
saw to tear them apart.

The United States economy spends approxi-
m a t e 1 y
$100 billion
each year on
advertise-
ment. For
what?

7 To
convince us
to buy
things we
would not
buy other»
wise: that is
to say, to buy things we do not need. Irwe really
wanted something, we would not need propae
ganda to inform us of the fact. If we merely
needed information about the products we seek,
we would not need Michael Jordan to act as the
quality-control inspector by playing basketball
with cartoon characters, We would do just ﬁne,
indeed we would ﬁnd much better information,
by consulting relatively impartial, independent
sources like Consumer Reports , sources which,
if not for corporate advertising, would become
much more prevalent and better funded than they
are at present.

So long as corporate
advertisement is in our
midst, it remains a
barrier between us and

freedom.

7 To make us indifferent to quality, en-
thralled by fad: a company must compete with
others that make similar products. Now, it can
spend 1ts money either trying to improve the
quality ofthe products, or try1ng to control cone
sumers minds through advertising trying to
change consumers culture so that they will want
something not for its quality, but because
it is cool. in effect, a company purchases
our minds, and in exchange we pure
chase its products.

—To promote a culture ofconsume
erism: not only by urging us to con-
sume s eciﬁc products in speciﬁc
cases, ut on a massive scale
by diverting our hap iness
from the satisfying to t e ins
satiable.

, To desecrate our printed pages, our air,
out highways, our homes. 1n fact, to invade all
facets ofour lives with ugliness By its very na
ture, corporate advertisement must importune
upon us at the most inconvenient times, in the
most inconvenient places, in the most obtrusive
and obstreperous manner, precisely so that we
are forced to notice it, without means ofeseape.

_ To impose corporate control over every
facet ofour lives. virtually nothing remains pub-
lic, and almost nothing lies' 1n the sole domain
ofthe individual. Even National Public Radio' is
run on contributions made by corporate spon-
sors It takes little 1ma ination to realize that it is
at best an u hill batti for groups to act indev
pendently ofPtheir sponsors’ will. More often, the
groups make little effort to maintain indepen-

words from the abyss

dcncc, and they dehlae'ratel y do what will please
their contributors (the same principle is seen
quite clearly 1n pahrics) only those causes sup-
ported by capital can make their voices heard.
The public will plays no part in the process The
arts and the media (and our polit1cal system as
well, ofcourse) longago ceased to bedemocratic,
ifindeed they ever were. Our beloved free mar-
ket has swallowed them up and held them un.
digested in the stomach of its great corporate
beast. If a revolution in some ways resembles
regurgitation, is there any wonder why?
— To divert enormous sums of money
away from socially constructive ends, into
the toilets that have be-
come out televisions,
flushing into the
sewers of our “liv»
ing' rooms for six or eight minutes every half
hour,

For what reason, in short, does cor crate
America spend 1ts $100 billion a year, ut to
enslave us? So long as corporate advertisement
is in our midst, it remains a barrier between us
and freedom.

It may be true (we cannot know) that an
abolition ofadvettisement would, at least in the
short term, cause a few dollars to drop oﬁ’our
GDP But remember that $100 billion of that
GDP' is already a complete waste, spent produc-
ing nothing but our servitude and aesthetic oi»
lution And in exchange for this potential KISSr
we would regain control over our lives and
minds. Is it not a small price to pay? Or do we
sell our souls so cheaply?

Fight for Vilsack’s immigration drive

erik gable
est colum 1:

Ways to revitalize Iowa’s aging population
and sagging econom have been at the center of
much debate recent y. Governor Tom Vilsack
has proposed a reasonable solution: why not
embark on an ambitious program to encourage
immigration, bringing new workers and new life
back to a state that young people have been flee-
ing in droves?

Here in the liberal bastion of Grinnell Col-
lege, it sounds like a sensible idea. It ap ears,
however, that the majority oflowans feel differ-
ently. A recent poll sponsored

ythe Dr: Marrm Register ——-—_. _..__
So it appears that
opposition to
immigration is less a
matter of economic
fear than of good, old—

fashioned xenophobia.

foyuntl that fully 53 percent of
adults oppose encouraging1me
migrauon to the state.

The most common argu-
ment for limiting immigranon
is that immigrants supposedly
take jobs away from peo e
who are already here. Tiis
clearly cannot apply to Iowa,
where unemployment has been
hovering below two ercent
and whole employers rave to
scramble to ﬁnd enough workers to stay up and
running And fear oflos1ng jobs to immigiants
doesn’t even seem to be a factor' in lowans’ retiv
cence to let people in: only 38 percent of the
Regina’s respondents thought that immigrants
would take jobs away from Americans; 59 per
cent said that they would probably end up take
ing jobs that otherwise would go unﬁlled.p So it
appears that opposition to immigration is less a
matter ofeconomic fear than ofgood, old fashe
ioned xenophobia.

During the presidential caucuses last wine
ter, anti 1mmi ration groups like the Federation
for American ﬁn mmigration Reform tried to play
upon isolationist sentiments by running vchc»
merit ads in local newspapers. One such ad, ac
cording to Becky Bohrer of the Associated Press,
showed a picture ofa garbage dump with a su-
perimposed warning against immigration. An

other said that “quality of life is but a memory”
in Storm Lake, where hundreds of Latinos are
employed by a meat-packing plant The ads were
so offensive that man newspapers refused to run
them, and Vilsack enounced the sponsors as
“hate mongers

One need only look at the Van Wy ks and
Van Ersveldes dotting the phone books of
Grinnell and other Central Iowa communities
to know that Iowa, like the rest of the United
States, has always been a place of immigrants.
When newcomers are European, like the refugee
families from Bosnia that settled in Cedar Rap-
ids, they are welcomed with open arms. But ap-
parently when the' 1mmi rants are Latino and
Asian, t ey destroy our qual-
ity oflife

Recentefforts to make En-
glish the ofﬁcial state language
are part ofthis hostile attitude
toward non-White immie
grants. Fortunately. Governor
Vilsack strongly opposes such
lc islation and the lowa House

lg Representatives voted down
an 1311 lish only amendment
48—51 ast year.

Back in 1918, then-Gov-
ernor Harding actually out»
lawed s eaking any language other than English
in pubic He told citizens that rayers 1n En-
glish were the only kind God wou d understand,
and had a Lutheran minister jailed for delivering
part are sermon in Swedish. our executives have
come a long way since then, but we haven‘t been
so lucky with legislators: Grinnell’s representae
rive, Danny Carroll, was among the 43 votingto
deliver a slap in the face to immigrants with the
English-onl amendment.

What oes all this have to do with Grinnell
College? In his convocation address several weeks
ago, President Russell K. Osgood spoke brieﬂy
about the difficulty of attracting and retaining
minority professors' in a predominantly White
community People interested in increasing the
colleges diversity have begun to look beyond
Sixth Ave. and Park St. to the rest of Grinnell;
perhaps it is time to take a look at the rest of

Iowa as well.

storm Lake and Muscatine are currently
competing to be the rural location for a Center
for New Iowans, established by Iowa Workforce
Development. There’s no reason why, if more
such centers are opened, Grinnell shouldnt be a
candidate to receive one. The presence of the
college 1ves Grinnell a more accepting atmo»
sphere fir immigrants than other communities;
simultaneously, more immigrants living' 1n
Grinnell would make the college more attractive
to minority professors and administrators. The
two processes would feed off each other.

Another Center for New Iowans may be far
in the future but there are things we can do now
to help increase Iowas diversity on a statewide
level. Groups like the Diversity Coalition could
launch a campaign to convince legislators to sup»
port Vilsack’s drive for increased immigration
And there’s no reason why President Osgood and
the administration ofGrinnell College shouldn’t
io1n [licmt

We can lend our encouragement to Gover-
nor Vilsack in his efforts to revitalize Iowa
through immigration. Through letters, phone
calls, and personal visits, we can ask Dennis Black
and Danny Carroll to support the Vilsack plan,

And if that fails, we have the ultimate tool
in any democracy: the ballot box, in the 1998
elections, over 200 Grinnell College students
voted in the satellite polls on campus. Students
and staff represent a signiﬁcant portion of the
Poweshiek County electorate, and Danny Carroll
is up for re election this year. Ifhe wont sup
port immigration, then perhaps his opponent,
Democrat Bill Menner, will

The Diversity Coalition and like minded
Emu? have done a praiseworthy job offurtl‘iek
mg t e cause ofdiversity on the Grinnell Col-
lege campus. To make a real change in atmo»
sphere, however, we need to look not only be-
yond the college, but beyond the city ofGrinnell
itself. We should enthusiastically support Gov-
ernor Vilsack' in his drive to encoura e immigra»
tion, and use our energy to help diversify not
just our campus, but the town and state that we
live in.
