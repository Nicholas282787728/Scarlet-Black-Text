Men's Soccer Loses Close
Fair to Ranked Teams

By Doug Hodum

Last weekend, the men’s soccer
team was matched up against St.
Thomas of Minnesota and Colo-
rado College, two very good teams.
St, Thomas is ranked in the Mid-
west Region of the NCAA, and
Colorado is nationally ranked

Grinneli started the game ag-
gressively Saturday afternoon and
was winning the 50-50 balls,
However, they were unable to
convert their opportunities. St.
Thomas managed to capitalize on
one of their chances and went up 1-
0.

In the second half, St. Thomas
alsoplayed very aggressively,even
dirty at times. For the most pan.
Grinneli ignored therough piayand
attempted unsuccessfully to even
the score.

Grinneli has never beaten Colo»
rado College, so they took to the
field Sunday moming with the in-
tention of ending that curse. After
a shaky start, the team played su-
perbiyagainstthenationallyrranked
team. They allowed the high-
powered offenseonlyafewchances
while creating some of their own.
At the half, however, the game was
still scoreless.

Throughoutthcsecondhalfboth
teams wereloolo'ngto takethe lead,

but were continuously thwarted by
the other. Unfonunately, a mental
mistake in the Grinnell defense led
to a fastvbreak down the side by a
Colorado forward He let fly a
beautiful shotpastthedefensewhich
ricocheted off the far post into the
goal.

A short time later, another mis-
take resulted in a penalty shot
against Grinneli. With the pressure
on him, Howard Gardos, the Grin—
nell goalkeeper, made a beautiful
save to keep the game close at 170.

For the remaining 10 minutes,
Grinneli applied the pressure, but
CC simply denied every attempt.
Atone point, Grinneli hit the cross
bar, but that was as close as they
wouldcome. When the [inalwhistle
blew, Grinneli had won a moral
victory, but had lost the game.

On Tuesday, Grinneli had a
conference game against Coe.
Although the game was nor nearly
ofthecaliberofthewoekend games,
Grinneli came away with a 2-H
victory on goals by co-captains
StechairChild Ian Lorimerand by
freshman Sean Ramsey. The team
was above the generally dirty tac-
tics employcd by Coe and took the
game in the second half. Despite
being a bit tired and sluggish. they
managed to remain unbeaten in the
conference.
