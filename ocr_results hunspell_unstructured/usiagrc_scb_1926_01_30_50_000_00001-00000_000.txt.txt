Resolutiu Ctnllﬂtlftl’c which
Proposes st- to Action.

iliss Clara J. Andersen, director or
physical training for women, was one
of two delegates‘ appointed by Goverv
nor John Hainmill to represent lowa
at a national conference on outdoor
recreation, held in \V‘rlshlngton, Jami-
a.” 20 and 21. The other delegate
from this state was Mrs. E. F. Arnr
strong, of Fort Dodge, representing
the lowa Federation of Women's
Cluhs.

Over 200 representatives from all
parts of the country attended the cone
ierence. which took place in the as-
sembly room of the first United states
Chamber of commerce building. The
conference was first organized two
years ago at the request of President
Coolidge, who sounded the keynote of
the Washington assembly when he
said, "The prime objective for which
I feel we should strive is to endeavor
to make available for the average Am-
erican outdoor recreation with all that
it implie, and to preserve our fa-
cilities for outdoor recreation for our
children and our children’s children."
The president believes firmly in the
responsibility each state bears for the
well-heing of its citizens, with regard
to industrial recreation, water pol-
lution and the protection of beaches
and streams.

Di cuss Sports.

Fishing, swimming, boating and
other water sports are among the
most valuable which can be fost—
ered, the conference found, anrl the
send ion of many inland rivers is so
impaired by faulty methods of sewage
that these pastimes are impossible.
The Cedar River. which flows through
Waterloo, Cedar Rapids and other
Iowa towns,"was cited as an example
of this unpleasant fact in one speech
on the subject, Along the Atlantic
seaboard ocean liners discharge so
much oil that in many places the bath-
ing beaches are rendered useless. “

Attention was paid to the stimulae
tion of nature study and to other
phases of the educational side of rec-
reation. It developed during the con-
ference that public parks are not only
of esthetic interest and beauty, hut
they have a real educational value as
well. The resolutions committee, oz
which iiiss Andersen was a meinher,
sent recommendations to the gover-
nors of all the states, urging them to
appoint committees which would sur—
vey the work that has been done and
that which should be done. states
were urged to work out a program of
good roads and camps. The whole
spirit of the meeting was one of fewer
“keep off the grass" signs,

Cabinet Men Speak.

The conference was addressed by
Dwight F. Davis, secretary of war;
Hubert Work, secretary of the ins
terior; John Barton Payne, chairman
of the American Red Cross; Dr. Char-
les Adams. director of the Roosevelt
Wild Life experiment station; Dr. T.
s. Palmer, ot' the United States Bio-
logical survey; James Davis, secre-
tary of labor, and L. H. Weir, an ex-
pert on municipal and county park
systems. Miss Antler-sens comment
was that the conference was a "com.
prehensive thing." She believed that
it vitally affected the welfare of eve
any American,

while in Washington, Miss Antler»
sen also visited the senate and heard
one of that chambers daily harangues
on the world court.

By weight, speed and ability to
handle the ball, the Kansas Jaybawk-
ers opened their three day lowa in\ass
ion with a 36 to 19 win, Thursday
night, over the Pioneers.

Although the “Fhug” Allen team
lacked the finesse in passing and has-
ket shoting that has brought the aVlley
championship to the Kansans so fre-
quelltly, the defense was so rigid and
the attack sufficiently ~rong, to ad-
minister the worst defeat that Grin-
nell has suffered this year. Black's
squad seemed to be in a slump as
compared with the recent games with
the Oklahomans. .

The Kansans presented the nearest
to a “blacksmith" lineup that has
played here this year With the exe
ceptlon of Schmidt every man who
started the game was six foot in
height and beefy. The reserves who
went in near the cod oi the game in-

lime Edge From start

The westerners did not pile up their
commanding lead until late in the
second half, yet it was evident soon
after Gordon tipped in the first field
goal that the Kansans held the edge.
At half time the score was 13 to 6,
but the margin was increased to
eleven points when Gordon and
Schmidt scored in succession soon
after the start of the final period. Dar
lis, Dutiing and Lamb garnered bas-
kets at long intervals which were in-
terspersed with successful Jaybawk
attempts. However, the Pioneers had
begun to creep up when the final sun
went off.

[It Better Shape Tonight.

The Nebraska Cuinhllskel‘s invade
the Pioneer court tonight for the
fourth home game 01' the season. Al-
though the Scarlet and Black (1
blers have failed to annex a win to
date, Chances for El. victory tonight are
fairly bright. The Pioneers were far
off color Thursday and they are about
due to come through.

‘Vhile tile 2-l»l-l Cornhuskel‘ win at
Lincoln two weeks ago wits rather de-
cisive, coach Black's men were not in
the physical cnilditioll that they are
now, Moran, Niblo and Peterson were
on the injured list and Davis was in“
eligible.

in the ranks of coach Berg’s squad,
Snidha, forward, Eckstrom, center,_
and Brown, guard, stand out as the
main cogs ill the scoring machine. In
the Grillueli game at Lincoln, Smaha
run wild ill the Second half, tossing
the sphere through the hoop five times
from the field. Brown, 9. flashy
guard, connected for three field goals
the same evening.

The starting lineup for the Pioneers
tonight has not been announced but
it is likely that Peterson, Niblo, Mark,
Lamb and Chase will all see Service
before the final gun. Peterson played
a nice game against Kansas and eith—
er he or Nihlo Will probably start at
the guard position opposite Capt.
Wing.

Coach Black devoted much or the
afternoon practice yesterday to in-
structicn in working the ball down
the floor faster, and in breaking
through the defense of the opposition.
The sophomore guards, Peterson and
Mark, were given special attention in
accurate and fast passing.
