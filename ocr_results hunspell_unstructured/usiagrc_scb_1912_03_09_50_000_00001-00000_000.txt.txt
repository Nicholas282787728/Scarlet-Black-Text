Grinnell‘s 2 at Des Monies—
Both Contests Fiercely Fought.

Grinnell lost both debates last night.
with the decision standing 3 to 2 in la-
vor oi Drake, and -i to 1 in iavor
o! Ames. Both contests rrci-e oi high
order and were ﬁercely iought.

Drake won the triangular League
championship, detecting both Griirnell
and Amos.

The question was: “Resolved, That
an international Tribunal Having JI ..
isdiction Over all International D
putes Should be Established.”

In the debate hero against Ames,
Professor Jesse Macy acted as clia'
man, and started tiie iorensic ni
grinding soon alter eight. Taylor, the
ﬁrst aiiirnoative speaker, deﬁned the
question and presented the demand or
the afﬁrmative for a coirrt oi trained
judges union will be permanent and
which will decide questions according
to precedent. In rsing armament
and intrea g debts show that no»

diiiercncts at The Hui-tire, by private
arbitration, or by war. The H‘ no is
clumsy in operation, its judgments are
otten a compromise, and no terrntr
has confidence in it. The new corirt
will inspire conﬁdence m it \ ll be
permanent and will base its decisions
cn precedent.

Sent Out Teams Since 1908—
Movement Prosperirig Now.

A record in Grrnneii Gospel Tcaut‘
work is to be established this year by
sending out three teams during the
coming spring vacation. Heretoioro
one tearii pci- vac tion was as much
as oi-iiiiiell could get together, and
most oi the time only one team a year
was sent, but the interest has been in—
crcasing and it was thought feasible
to organize three teams. Negotiations
recently were opened with churches in
Gilmair, Eddy-ville, and Hiteiiiao to
plate teams there this spring. Eddy~
ville, as usual, responded very enthusie
astically. a team will go there. Giloiao
is also very much enthused over the
prospect llitcnian has not been
lreaid troin delinitely as yet, but Fred
Bale. who has the placing or the team
in charge, is sure that this town also
will tall inlo line,

Strong Leaders Secured.

The leaders lor- the teams will prob
ably he Harvey Young at Gilrirnn, Jay
Wilson at Etltlyiilie, and Clinton Har-
rison at Hitcnian, 'i‘iic teairis will be
organized iiillliediatcll'r and will begii
working up their speeches.

Griirncll‘s lit-st gospel team went out
in mud. under the leadership at George
'l‘iiloii. Five men visited Newell dur-
ing the Christians vacation that year.
During spring vacation in 1910, a tenth
led by Curt u'cils went to ldddvville.
where it created such an impression
that it team has been sent. to Eddyville
every time since Paul MatEachron,
liaiold Strong, "Cub” Hair. and John
i- airs iorined the team that year. Last
year, during the Easter vacation, Palii
ilatEachr-on headed a team composed
oi “Stout” Turner, James siutz, Paul
Barrett and iiarl Eslick, which also
went to Eddyvilie, Harvey Young,
