Acknowledging a parallel between
the situation surrounding this year's
rnarchup against the Rarnswithlastyeat's
in which the Pioneers could have
clinched a playoff berth but were upset,
Coach David Arseneaulr commented. “1
think the biggest difference was that were
able to use our experience this time
around. We were abirnisry, bur once we
got into the ﬂow of the gaine we really
played well. The 21.0 run was nothing
short of phenomenal."

The Pioneers were led by senior Ed
Brands. who netted 33 points despite
playing only 19 minutes. Junior Clayton
Kanohiro added l7points and foursreals,
while senior leff Boyle served up seven
assists. Senior Andtis Upitis led the
Pioneers with nine rebounds, while soph,

On Friday Grinnell closed out the
regular season with a thrilling 75.73 vic-
tory at Coe. The Pioneers led the gaine
by as many as 17 points, scaring the nets
in the first half with 43.5 percent threer
point shooting and owning a 12—point
halftime lead. However. the Kohawks
raged back in the second half and even-
tually led by four points before Grinnell

sealed the win on two free throws by
Brands with under a minute remaining

“Coe really turned up the intensity
in the second halfand probablydcscrved
to win." said Arseneaulr. “But when it
came doivn to crunch time. boyle really

distance that only he shoots from, then

whittled away at the large deficit by our.

iusr dug ourselves in too deep with our

earlier performance, but we played with

The Pioneers most certainly did
make a game out of it despite losing. 79-
66. Junior Amy Robinson racked up a
careerrhigh eight assists while Raymer
and Hallet comhined for 20 points and
16 rebounds

Dacey Waldron ended herrareer in

think of no better way to go out." Wal-

rlrne Grinnell scoring with 1113 career
points.

Next season will most certainly
prove to be anodaer rough one for the
Pioneers as they lose five seniors in Wal—
dton, Raymer. Hallett. Schoen and Katey
Munley. “It will talte a collective effort
to replace these five players, but I feel
that our personnel will be able to adapt.
I expect good things in the future," con»
cluded Wood. .
