The exact place Where student government meem

deﬁnite and concrete, to guard against misunderstanding.
The rule that there should be no majors or minors taken

ruling oi the faculty.

Aside trom the question of justiﬁmtion for this sort
of a rule, its source and manner of enforcement are at
odds “ith each other. it makes the League board a

The conllict betuccn Saturday classes and week-cud

nights, the argument being that: it is a. regular school

The college has never adjusted itseit the way it should
