Pioneer touchdown. Dale Lamb

Helped by a surprise first-round
victory in the first doubles slot, the
women's tennis team grabbed
fourth place in the conference meet
two weeks ago at Ripon. The squad
later dropped two dual matches to
finish the season with a 2-4 mark,

The finish in the conference
tournament, which Carleton
College won, was one notch higher
than last year's showing. The
Pioneers wereled by fourth singles
player Amy Frieden, whose second
place finish was the best of any
Grinnellian.

The upset of the meet belonged to
Grinnell's top doubles team,
Maggie McFadden and Karen

Philosophies
conflict on subs

by Toni Archbcrg

The closing moments of a 4371-1
rout of the Grinnell football team in
the cold and gloom of Rosenbloom
Field does not seem like a situation
that would inspire thought about
athletic philosophies. But the
Circumstance demonstrated nicely
the endless conﬂict of two ideas
that Grinnell coaches nlust wrestle
with’ the importance of niniiing
versus the importance of pai»
ticipating.

Wl|h several minutes left in
Saturday's Monmouth game, and
the contest securely in the
Scots‘ win column, one starts to
wonder if Pioneer substitutes
should bc put into the game.
Arguments pro and con are per
suasive. On one hand, allowing
subs to play might lead to an
embarrassing drubbing ot the
Pioneers that would not be good for
morale, And low morale isn't good
{or later performances. People
who say future results do not
matter are being unrealistic.

0n the other hand, allowing subs
into the contest gives them a furl,
rcwarding experience that they
deserve, considering the
dedication they show by coming to
practice everyday.

The sensibility of both pros and
cons causes differences of opinion.
Defensive Coach l\‘lo iiunl put his
suhs into the Monmouth game
Head coach Edd Bowers asked him
to take them out. Among players,
starting and reserve, some said
more people should have played,
Some said the substituting was
fine, Most hedged and qualified
before taking stands somewhere in
the middle.

Keeping the first string in the
Monmouth game was probably the
right. decision. Aside from the
merit of the argument menh'oned
earlier, which Bowers said was the

basis for his decision, there are
other Considerations The
Scots, in accordance with their
reputation, played a very physical
game. as indicated by the large
number of penalties assessed
against them Also, they are big
and heavy And they kept their
regulars in the game until the last
offensive possession The point is
that the Grinnell reserves. who are
a lot smaller and lighter. could
have been easily injured, not to
mention humiliated. The obligation
to play in a junior varsity contest
two days after the Monmouth
game is another reason [or keeping
the reserves healthy and rested on
the sidelines,

But that is the Monmouth game.
What about the remaining con»
tests, which are against less
physical opponents and have no JV
game following them? If a future
matchrup gets one-sided in favor oi
the opposition, the Grinnell
reserves should play. my7 First,
knowing that a score was run up
against the second string has to
take away some of the
demoralizing sting, at least for the
starters. Sccond. it subs are not
played when Grinnell is losing
badly, they probably “ill not get
significant amounts of playing
time again this season. They do not
get into close games and. frankly.
the chances are not great that the
Pioneers \\ill hand any of their
remaining opponents a sevcre
pounding of their own, riiially,
emphasis on participation seems to
be more Consistent with Grinnell’s
cherished, almost unique athletic
practices of not recruiting or
giving scholarships,

in the final analysis, the problem
is not deciding whether Winning or
participation is important to
Grinnell athletics. Rather, it is
deciding which is more important.

the Kohawks. The closest Grinnel
came to shifting the outcome was
at third doubles, where the contest
stretched to a tie-breaker.

Grinnell hosted Central
in the year's last outing. Meredith
Johnson and Jeanette Mulcahy
were the winners for Grinnell, as
Central Won, 872.

Although this year’s final record
was lower than that of last season,
coach Anna Wack said that
"winning is secondary to personal
development.“
