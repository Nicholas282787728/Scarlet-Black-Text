Media should be recompensed

The faculty should follow through on their rejection of practicum credit for campus media
positions and move for a consistent policy in this area. As was stated at the lightly attended
meeting this week, the idea behind practicum credit is to give an incentive to the interested but
relléctant student who can add the extracurricular activity to her/his workload and get a
cre l . ,

‘The discrepancies which exist between getting a credit for bowling, saying five lines in a
play, and working twenty hours a week for the campus media must be redressed. Possibly, the
media people should just be compensated for their time with higher salaries. A 100% increase
is not out of line. There hasn’t been an increase of the 3823's staff line—item in four years, A
100% increase would mean the S&B staffer would be paid about forty cents an hour on the
average.

If there is no practicum credit for media positions and if there are no salary increases, then
the only incentive left to students who are interested in the media is either ambition or blind
loyalty. Maybe that should be enough to go on at a place like Grinnell, but realistically it is not.
We don’t expect our actors and athletes to devote their valuable time to their activities without
some benefit.

_If there cannot be a credit balance, let us at least offer media people a money compensation,
Give the media an appropriate incentive to attract students. It’s only fair.

Mayer free-ﬂight bad idea

Okay, it’s personal pet peeve time and so you can take or leave this as you will, ‘ ,

With money in the Student Government budget getting as tight as it is these days, it was With
shock that I learned of the granting of $400 to fly Profrlssor Wayne Moyer back to Iowa for the
Relays. This $400 is onerthird of the total $1200 allotted by SGA for the Relays.

In my mind, it is an outrageous expenditure, a complete blunder and a bad precedent. I have
also learned that the the airplane ticket has already been purchased. What poltroonery!

That is $400 which could go into the Initiative Fund, or to the ailing Mini»grants program, or
to the Cambodian Relief Fund, or to some needy group that is fed from the general
budget...But no, instead the SGA allocated the money just so a professor can drink beer, yell a
lot, judge a perverse Gong Show, wear a silly hat, and get covered with egg yolks.

It is a terrible precedent to allot money of such a large amount to an individual to be used
strictly for this individual’s transportation convenience. And this is a non-academic pursuit,
unlike the Minirgrants program which gives money to people to do things that are academical-
ly related.

Now I like a little debauchery as much as the next guy, but the fit of sentimentalism which
no doubt prompted the SGA to allocate these funds is inappropriate. Sure Professor Meyer has
devoted long hours of his time to making‘the Relays a success, but that virtue should be it’s
own reward. He also earned the love and respect of students for his efforts, but this free-ﬂight
deal is just not right.

Professor Moyer should, in good conscience, refuse the money and/or the ticket. if he wants
to come to the Relays (and it would be lovely if he did show) then he should pay for it himself.
Let‘s use our none-y to broader purposes, purposes which illustrate expenditures made for

public benefit , not private indulgence.
