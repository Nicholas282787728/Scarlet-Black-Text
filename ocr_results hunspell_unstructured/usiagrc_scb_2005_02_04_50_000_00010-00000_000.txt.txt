An education
and an abortion?

To the Editor:

It appears that education is not Grinnell College's
only interest. On Febr. 2, 2005, a red Dodge Stratus with
“Grinnell College” on the door was used to shuttle stu-
dents {or an abortion appointment at Planned Parents
hood in lowa City.

How do I know? My husband and Iwere there! We
know abortion appointments when we see them. We
have been going to abonion facilities for many years in
an attempt to speak up for the despised children slated
for abortion. Planned Parenthood killed over 20 children
that day including the baby ofthe couple in the back seat
ofGrinncll’s vehicle.

I think it is time for STOPP [the SocietyTo Outlaw
Planned Parenthood] of Ioum, and Missionaries to the
Pro-born Iowa to give Grinnell College an educational
lesson about abortion on demandTlIcrc are two sides to
consider. We represent the baby’s interest,

Thanlt you,

iDamm Holman.

Campus Dems changes

Hello. We are the new leaders of Campus Democrats
and we think it's time for a change. In the last election
season, some students may have felt alienated by some of
the tactics used in our attempt to turn Iowa blue. Further-
more, at times Campus Dems appeared to have a negative
tons; last issue’s letter to the editor titled “SCIPE docs
what?” illustrates the divisiveness we will avoid.

This semester we plan to promote Democratic leg-
islntion, bring progressive spmkcrs to campus, develop
grassroots organizing and build our relationship with our
er progressive student groups as well as local Democrats,
among other activities.

M:u1y of us on this campus are still distraught over
the 2004 Election results, but we made the difference in
electing Tom Riclly to the State Senate.Tlus Democratic
gain split the Senate 50-50. We have the chance to stand
and help the raise the minimum wage, provide healrheate
to more Iowans, and pass mddiscrimination bills.

The group has new leaders with new ideas and new
goals. But most importantly, we have open minds. We
want and need your help. The only way to reform this
group as well as the Democratic Party is through you.
At 7:30 on Tuesday, February 8, Cllmpus Denis will be
having an open forum in the aptly nnmed Forum Cof-
feehouse to discuss last semester and our next stepsth‘lat
direction do you want Campus Dems to take?

Democracy in Iraq:
what about D.C.?

Last week, Iraqi citizens voted for representatives irl
their new National Assembly On January 30th, they or
etcised a fundamental right shared by citizens ordornoe
mcles around the world: voting for a representative to their
national lcgislaturctYet, in U16 shadow of the United States
Capitol, residents of Washington, DC. do not enjoy the
same rights as their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad.

District residents have no voeing representation in the
us. Congress . no senators and nobody in the House of
Representatives with a ﬂoor vote. This oolonial situation
attends beyond notation without representation. Scores of
DC. ruidents have been sent to Iraq its members of the
National Guard and regular armed forces. Three ofthesc
soldiers have died. D.C. residents are paying the ultimate
sacriﬁce semng our country, but they are denied a vote in
the legislature that sends them to Mr.

I: docsnt have to be this way. There art: numerous
bills pending in Congress that would give DC, residents
Vomlg representation. If you believe in making the
United States a crue democracy, Contact your senators and
representatives and tell them to support ﬁill Voting repre-
scntation 11c, When you do, you'Ll be exercising a right
that will soon be enjoyed more in Baghdad than in our
own national capital.
