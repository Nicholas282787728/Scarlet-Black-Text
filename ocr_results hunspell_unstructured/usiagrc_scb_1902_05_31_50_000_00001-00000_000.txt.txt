ass of an individual star that in-
duced victory to give the benedic-
tion to Drake’s warriors,but it was
the combined efforts of a team of
stars who covered themselves with
glory and gathered up the largest
total of points ever won at a state
meet with one exception. The
meet was a success in every way.
It was run ot‘f in the shortest space
of time in which a state meet was
ever held. The postponement

from Friday reduced the number
or spectators somewhat, but it is
safe to say that fully three thous»
and people occupied the grand
stand and quarter stretch.

The
track and day were perfect. There
was scarcely any wind and the
track had the appearance ot a
smooth and shining pavement. It
was at once evident that fast time
would be made in all the events,
which was veriﬁed by the smash-
ing of seven state records, Three
of these went to Drakeithe half
mile run, iormerly 2 min. 3 3.5
seconds. now 2:00 2 5; the hammer
throw. formerly 132 ft, 8 in.. now
139 ft. 1% in :the 120 yard hurdles.
formerly 16 2.5 seconds. now l6
i-sseconde. Two tell to Iowa, the
discus throw increasing trorn in
it. 5 in,, to ii3 it. 2 in., and the
half mile relay having the old
mark of i min. 35 seconds re-
duced to l min. 34 2 ssec. Simp»
son carried oil the pole vault
record, raising it from to ft. 8 in.
to II it.

Drake’s men were in Fine iettle.
All the events were most bitterly
contested and some of the ﬁnishes
were heart breaking. yet her men
never gave evidence ot being “all
in."

Never before was there such an
aggregation or stars together in a
competition at astate meet. Grin~
nell’s men did all that was ex
pected ofthem. As is well known,
Lyman's and Conger's disabilities
made big holes in the team;
the hopes of Welker’s reinstate-
ment were unrealized, and to cap
the climax, Haines and Spaulding
were unable to compete. thus de-

 

priving the Grinnell track team
of ﬁve point \\’lnl’lCl'S. Witll such
a handicap the showing made was
creditable.

The totals or scores may be
changed somewhat, later, as pro
tests have been ﬁled against Young
and Pell 0t Drake, Jacobs of Ames
and Fisk of Grinncll. It all the
protests are allowed by the games
committee Drake will still have
the victory by a sate margin. but
Pell who now holds the individual
record in points, having 14% to
his credit, will be forced to pass_
that honor on to Bair who will
have 13 to his credit. Grinnell's
captain more than realized the
hopes of his friends. Set a yard
in the loo. he all but breasted the
tape even with Young. He won
third in the broad jump, third in
the high hurdles and took ﬁrst in
the low hurdles in 26 in; seconds,
nearly equalling the state record.
Had he been pushed he would
have broken the record easily.

Lee oi Simpson did plucky
work in the pole vault. beating
out both Pell and Chapman. The
usual spills occurred in both bi»
cycle events, but fortunately no
one was badly hurt.

Grinnell’s relay team was un-
tortunate, drawing 6th place trom
the pole and iorcing the men to
run on the outside of the turns.
adding over 20 yards to the entire
course covered. Some provision
ought to be made by placing the
men according to their distance
trom the pole.

The games committee at its
business meeting Wednesday
evening voted to throw out the
hop. step and jump and both bi-
cycle races altd substitute the 2
mile run and a mile relay.
