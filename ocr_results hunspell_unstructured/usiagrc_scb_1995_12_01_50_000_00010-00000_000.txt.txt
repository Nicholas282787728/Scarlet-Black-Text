man. SeniorStephanieHitztalerhad
two goals this season, qualify for the
NCAA Division 111 national meet
and perform better than she did at
the 1994 nationals,

It was a rocky path to meet the
challenge as Hitztalet sustained a
back injury midway through the sea«
son. The iniury took her off the road
and forced her to do all her (mining
in the pool. “It is extremely difficult
to get your heart rate up and keep it
high while doing a pool workout,”
explained Coach Freeman. “Consid
eringthat,Stephanie’s achievements
are remarkable.“

During her rehabilitation Hitz—
taler had to forego running at the
MidwestConfetencechampionships.
“It was very hard on Steph," noted
Freeman. “She wanted dearly to
defend her league championship.”
After placing second twice during
her first two seasons, the Colorado
nativewontheindividualloop crown
in 1994 and ivas a favorite this fall.

After being out of competition
for fourweeks, Hitztalerran her first
race at the DiVision 111 Central Re»
gion meet. Incredibly, she was the
last person to qualify for nationals
out of the region. “We knew that
another week would really help
Steph's chances at nationals, and
the results really showed that,"coln-
mented Coach Freeman.

At the national meet in Lair
Crosse,Wis..Hitztalerimproved her
position from the 1994 results by
over 20 places. She finished 54th in

of Alemerica status. With that
time she also setanew personal—best
mark. ”Sreph was extra motivated
because hersister, patents and a num—
ber of cross country runners were
there to watch," said Freeman.

“What Steph did the final
month of the season is truly amaz<
ing. It was a story book ending to a
great career,” noted Freeman, Hitz»
taler is the first Grinnell woman to
run at the national meet twice.

“We are truly going to miss
Steph next year. Since the moment
she arrived on campus she has been
the model of consistency in terms of
training and dedicarion. It is grati.
fying to see her finish her career on
a high,” concluded Coach Freeman.
