Price Defends Revenue Sharing

by Jim Alt,

I960 Grinnell Phi Beta Kappa
graduate John R. Price, jr.,a
special assistant to President
Nixon and member of the Do-
mestic Council, spoke on “To:
ward a National GrowthPol-
icy" Friday nightin the Forum
south lounge. Price,a Grinnell
trustee who was in town for
that group’s Spring meeting,
was sponsored by the PPPE.

In his remarks, Price pro~
moted proposals to rectify
“the imbalance in opportuni-
ties between rural and urban
America, which lead to other
problems." Heading the Ad-
ministration's list of propoV
sale, Price said, are certain
features of the President's
controversial revenue sharing
plan.

Price emphasized national
migration patterns in which
“people from Middle America
are spilling out to both
coasts." He described the tyr
pical migrant to large cities
as the "opportunity seeker"
who is pursuinghigher income
than he can earn in rural
America. The Administration
hopes to stem or reverse this
flow of migration by subsidi-
zing development of "points of
actual and potential growth
which might ultimately be an
alternative settlement point"
for urban migrants.

Price said that the proposed
revenue sharing plan allows

Trustees Declare Grinnell A Work! College’

The Trustees oflowa College
(Grinnell) officially declared
this institution to be a ”world
college” in a vote Sunday.

Moine West, head of the Ad
Hoc Committee for a World
College, presented the trus-
tees with a petition signed by
about 425 students and faculty
urging the declaration.

The resolution passed by the
trustees says in part: “That
among the purposes of Grin-
nell College is the conviction
that it should be a ‘world colt
lege’ dedicated to lransnatr
ional cooperation and world
law."

The resolution recognized
that “we live inanage ofgrowV
ing world interdependence",
that “the college has yet to
commit its full potential in
contributing to the work of
achieving world peace and hui
man welfare," and that "unr
precedented efforts are need-
ed to free mankind from the
scourge of war and to apply
man’s energies and knowledge
for the good of the world com-
munity."

The resolution furthercalled
“upon the members of the
Grinnell community to pledge
their best efforts to theeslab’

lishment of peace and to the
wise use of all possible re»
sources for the betterment of
mankind."

Four concrete actions were
recommended as part of the
resolution: that the United
Nations flag be ﬂown daily
beside the us. flag, that gr-
oups be encouraged to raise
money for the United Nations
Special Fund, that the college
join with a college in another
country in a “transnational
bond", and that a coordinating
group be formed for all or-
ganizations andactivities conr
nected with world peace.

The Ad Hoc Committee is
working on all four of these
points now. The college land-
scape committee has been
informed of the flagresolution
and is expected to dml with
the matter. Apparently, a new
flagpole will be built With col-
lege money. Money for the
U.N. will be raised through
such projects as a SAGA fast,
etc., expected to start next
fall.

The collegealready has some
ties with colleges in India and
Africa. Hopefully, these will
be expanded to encompass the

world college concept, includ-
ing exchanges of students and
faculty.

The new coordinating group
would work with the Foreign
Students Board, the Interna-
tional Studies Committee, the
United Nations Association in
the community, and would
conduct the educational and
fund-raising programs conr
nected with the world college
program.

West commented that the
most momentous part of the
resolution is that the trustees
of the college have for the
first time committed the coin
lege as an institution toa posi-
tive program for worldpeace.

The thrust for the program
came from Bill Wickersham,
a representative of the United
World Federalists, who spoke
on campus in January.

West said the main objection
to the program among studs
ents was caused by a lack of
faim in the U.N. and its ef~
forts to date in the area of
world peace. However, he em-
phasized that an organization
such as the U.N. is the place
to begin if world peace is
ever to become a reality.

communities with populations
between 20,000 and 250,000 to
receive funds from both rural
and urban developmentmoney,
thus favoring them and en—
couraging their development.
In theory, these communities
will invest their funds in pro*
jects designed to attract new
industry and population. The
new industries will move to
semi~rural locations because
of savings offered them by the
small citiesandmadepossible
by federal money.

Price then described a new
program ofstatewide develop-
ment plans which would give
the governor of each state
power to coordinate local dev-
elopment plans within his
state, and called the present
setup "a mess." He alsosupr
ported a proposal for national
land useplanninginwhicheach
state would control growrhar~
ound its key areas under fed
eral financing and guidelines.
He saidthattheprogramwould
include controlling ”environr
mentally important factors."

In the question'andranswer
session following his formal
remarks, Price was called
upon to defend the Administra-

tion's positionsandproposals.
In response to a question on
whether the Administration is
doing anything to slow down
population growth, Price cited
a Commission on Population
Growth study which found a
trend since 1967 toward den
clining fertility rates in wo-
men. If the trend continues,
he said, replacement cycle
(zero population growth)would
be reached in about 25 years.
He also said that the federal
government gives Planned Pa-
renthood $150 million an-
nually.

Other questions which Price
fielded, largely with the aidof
superior knowledge about the
President’s specific plans and
an undying optimism, covered
equity of plans for distribut-
ing federal funds, probability
of success in affectingmigra-
tion patterns, relievinglmme-
diate problems oflarge cities,
and whether state and local
governments will spend fed
eral money fairly. Price pre-
sented a rosy view of the fut-
ure, and at least one student
remarked upon leaving, ”I
only wish Icouldbelieve that's
how it will really work."

Art Show Has New Approaches

by Ellen Schiferl

Still life as subject matter
drifts in and out of vogue. The
exhibit now in Schaffer Gal-
lery displays some new ap
proaches to it.

As with the familiar wine
bottles and fruit baskets of
still lives in the past, theartr
ists use ordinary subjectmatn
terva typewriter, tea bags,
or a pair of shoes. Some of
die artists have clung to the
table setting as their focus
and have tried to approach it
from a more modern view-
point. This is evident in the
works of Kesl, Deem, Lechn
ary, and Suttman. With the
possible exception of Kesl,
these works are the leastsuc~
cessful.

Other paintings are little
more than contemporary real-
ism. Among these are
Jacquettes "Chrome Chair”,
unique only in the angles chon
sen for the point of view, and
Thompson’s "Water Drops."

The most provocative works
are those which defy labeling.
These include the grotesque
pig’s head that is not fright-
ening or disgusting, butalmost
delightful. Snowden's “Yellow
Pipes" have a bold assert
iveness and despite their sim-
plicity (or possible because
of it), they leave an impresr
sion. While the basic compo-
sition is similar to some
works of minimal art, the use

JEWELERS SlNCE I87l

of a recognizable object helps
susmin the viewer's interest
and gives him something to
relate to.

Finally, William's "Untib
led" is an intriguing swarm
of color and texture. It is one
of the few contemporaryworks
I have seen that is bothunique
and successful. its complex of
wriggling forms invitesa sex~
ual interpretation, but the
painting is also enjoyable on
a strictly compositional level.
Its ambiguity enhances in-
terest because it provides the
eye with a playground while
the mind works with the
meaning.
