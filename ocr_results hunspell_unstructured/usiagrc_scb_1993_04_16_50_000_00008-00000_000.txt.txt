One of the main objectives of the
Shanse Monks’ world tour. which
brought them to Grinnell this week,
is to spread awareness of the current
situation in Tibet.

“At present, travelers who go to
Tibet on their own know about the
delicate situation in Tibet," said
Tsering. ”And the different govem-
merits around the world also know
what is happening. But for commer-
cial reasons the governments don’t
inform the public aboutit. So,on this
tour. we want to make people aware
of what is happening."
