Heaven Can

Wait:

lighthearted comedy

by Howard A. Gardos
In 1978, Warren Beatty
decided to make a rerun of the
1944 film Here Comes Mr.
Jordan, so he co-wrotc, co-
dirccted, and starred in Heaven
Cart Wait. The film went on to
be a huge ﬁnancial and critical
success, receiving to Academy
Award nominations and causing
Time magazine to label Beatty
“Mr. Hollywood". However,
through all the hype, Heaven Cart
Watt is simply a lighthearted
comedy, which fluctuates
between being cute and being
stupid
Beatty plays a professional
athlete who is prematurely mken
to heaven by a rookie angel,
played by codiroctor Buck Henry,
who sees Beatty entering a life
threatening situation and decides
to take his soul to heaven in
order to keep him from suffering
the pain of his death. Henry,
however, is wrong to remove
Beatty so early He still has a
life ahead of him, but once Henry
steps i itc- tio tuttget has a body
to live it in. So he is given the
body of a rich, corrupt man who

has just been killed by his
equally corrupt wife (Dyan
Cannon) and private secretary
(Charles Grodin). To make
Bcatty‘s new life more difﬁcult,
his wife and secretary are still
plotting to murder him; and then
there is Julie Christie, his new
love interest. Also ﬂoating
around in all this confusion is
Beatty's former trainer (Jack
Warden), who is trying to train
Bcatty to get in shape for the
Super Bowl.

It’s a fun movie, silly and
pointless. Realty and Christie are
a cute couple. Buck Henry plays
a cute incompetent angel trying
to make up for his mistake. Jack
Warden has a lot of interesting
facial expressions as Beatty tries
to convince him that he’s still
the same person, even though
he‘s in the body of someone else
(he still looks like Beatty to the
audience). [leave/i Cart Wail
may not be a cinematic, earth-
shaking masterpiece, but it is an
enjoyable lightheaned comedy.

Hope and Glory: WWII
through a child's eyes

by Daniel Bliss

John Boorman's 1987 ﬁlm,
Hope and Glory, is a major
achievement. it is an
autobiographical account of
World War ll through his eightr
year-old eyes, and while not
forgetting the very real danger
Britain was in, Boorman has
somehow turned it into a
comedy.

The film is set in a lower
middle-Class, 19305 London
suburb of semi-detached houses.
It is a dour life that these
moderately poor people live, and
showing the film through the
amoral eyes of a child, Bill
Rohan, demonstrates the
excitement of the war, as well as
the day-torday fear everyone
endured. There are scenes olBill
and his friends playing with
shrapnel, or on bombsites,
intermingled with the sight of
people during an air raid running
for their dear lives to a shelter.

Bill’s elder sister, Dawn, is
played by Sammi Davis, who
played the blonde teenage
prostitute in Mona Lisa. Her
part touches upon another issue
of wartime, that of the thousands
of American and Canadian
soldiers in Britain, waiting for

their orders to invade France.
Dawn falls for a Canadian (Jean»
Marc Barr), and while there is
some truth in the English
wartime jibe, "Ovensexed, ever-
paid and over here,” Boorman
also has a good point in that
some English girls wanted easy
sex, too.

Two further events in the
film are especially interesting.
One is when the Rohuns' house
bums down (although not due to
a bomb) and they escape to the
tranquillity ofBill's grandfather‘s
villa on the Thames. It is a
release for the family who, apart
from suffering from the strain of
the frequent air raids, would like
to live far away from the small
houses of the city if they could
afford it, The other is the
accidental bombing of the school,
celebrated by the Children who no
longer have to endure the
brutality of the headmaster’s
Victorian values. For many in
Britain the war proved in the long
run to be a major release from the
dinosaur of Victoriana.

Arsenic

and Old
Lace

Arsenic and Old Lace is a
1944 classic moving picture
play. Based on Joseph
Kesserling's Broadway play of
the same name, the film stars
three of the original cast:
Josephine Hull, Jean Adair. and
John Alexander. Hull and Adair
reprise their roles as two
Brooklyn spinsters who are kind
as can be, except for one thing:
their favorite diversion is dosing
old men with arsenici Actually,
they use a rather lztSty mixture of
a teaspoon of arsenic, a half
teaspoon of Strychnine, and a
pinch of cyanide to a gallon of
elderberry wine.

The two older women take
care of their nephew, Teddy
(Alexander), who thinks himself
Teddy Rooseveltr Raymond
Massey plays Nephew Jonathan,
who like Aunt Abby and Aunt
Martha (Adair and Hull), has 12
murders to his credit. Cary Grant
plays Nephew Mortimer, a New
York drama critic, who falls in
love with the girl next door.

All that follows is, if not one
of director Frank Capra's best
films, at least one of his most
amusing.

Innerspace

by Mayrlee Chai

Innerspace is billed as a
comedy-fantasy, which is a neat
label for a messy story line.
Now listen carefully“

Dennis Quaid plays a macho
test pilot who is shrunkialong
with his “submersible pod"
vehiclcito the size of a blood
corpuscle so that he can be
injected into a rabbit. But when
industrial spies try to sabotage
the experiment, he is injected
instead into an unsuspecting
grocerystore clerk, Martin Short,
for safe-keeping. while ﬂoating
around inside Short’s head, Quaid
must persuade Short to listen to
him, to search for a special
computer chip that will bring
him back to normal size, and to
do it quickly since Quaid will run
out of oxygen in no time flat.

Actually, lnnerspace is not as
bad as it sounds. The special
effects are top-notch. and it
you’ve ever wanted to see blood
streams, a beating human heart,
and other organs from the inside
out, this is the movie for you.

Short, of Saturday Night Live
fame, gives his funniest
performance to date as the Highly
clerk on the verge of a nervous
breakdown. Unfortunately,
Quaid, in this pro-Big Eary
outing, displays all the charisma
of a Neanderthal. Meg Ryan
(D,0.A., The Preridio), as
Qual s “journalist" girlfriend,
is, well, perky.

Even if you don’t have time
to see the whole movie, do try to
catch the last 20 minutes, as
endings this dumb must be seen
to be believed.

Das Boot deserves a

VIeWI n g
by Matt Macho

I know it‘s hard to believe,
but a foreign film is playing at
Grinnell. it‘s called Dar Boot.
and it‘s a German film about a
World War II Urboat crew. As
such, it has many of the
traditional war film/sub hunt el-
ements, including suspenseful
chase scenes and exciting
torpedoing sequences. But this
film has much more to it, which
perhaps explains why it won far
too many international film
awards to list here.

To begin with, the film
presents a unique opportunity for
American audiences in that it
shows the war at sea from the
perspective of the German "wolf
pack," not the Allied ships that
were their prey. it also does an
excellent job of conveying the
cramped conditions of German
submarines (which were usually
about 20 percent smaller than
their American counterparts, with
more room devoted to torpedoes).
The crews had to sleep in shifts

among the stores of food, each
man lying in the sweat of the
man who slept on the cot before
him.

The film makes a strong, and
yet not cliched, statement about
war. The submarine crew goes
through hell, completing an
impossible mission after months
at sea, sneaking into an Allied
harbor, sinking several ships, and
then returning home alive for a
victory celebration, only to be
massach by Allied planes during
the award ceremony.

Dar Boot combines realism
and drama successfully and
wrings many impressive
performances from its cast. I can
only hope that the Films
Committee is showing the
subtitled, and not the
monstrously dubbed, version. in
either case, Dar Boat deserves a
viewing,

Streetwise cuts to the

core

by Brian Strause

Ever scour a diny sink, but
finally realize the stains just
shine a little brighter? Similarly,
the regular rains in Seattle have
failed to wash the gutters cleanr
instead of slipping down the
drain, the homeless are only
challenged by one more element
of their surroundings,
consequently sharpening their
sense of how to survive.
Streetwise investigates the
underbelly of Seattle, taking a
sobering look at what it takes [0s
live on the street. This
documentary focuses on two alley
urchins who have barely hit
puberty, Erin and Dewayne Erin
mattcrrofrfactly talks of how she
was turning tricks before her first
period. Morn calls it just “a
phase." Gee, it's hard to imagine
why she ever left home.
Dewayne scavenges, cons, and
begs. His friends affectionately
refer to him as “Rat." The two
form a kind of team.
Unfortunately, it’s going to take

The 3
CINEMA

a lot more than this alliance to
beat the street.

Director~eameraman Martin
Bell has created a slick piece of
filmrdocumenting, a slice of life
that most of us would rather not
see, let alone take a bite of.
Expertly shot, Streetwise cuts to
the core of the urban nightmare,
leaving reality, at times. a little
too real. The documentary is the
perfect medium for this subject,
as the story is told in an
unadulterated context by the
people who live it.

For an aftcrrmovie snack, Rat
suggests you call your favorite
local pizza proprietor and order an
exotic combination, perhaps the
delectable duo of anchovies and
pineapple. Fail to pick up the
pic at the requested time, then
about an hour later scour the
establishment's dumpster for
your order. Come on, take a
bite.
