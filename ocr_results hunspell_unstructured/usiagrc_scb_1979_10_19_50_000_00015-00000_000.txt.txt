Protests theft of history papers

To the editor: This past week, I had
to do a paper for Chlnese history.
Alter meeting with my professor, 1
went to the library to get the book
which he said I needed for my
research, Although it should have
been there, it wasn't on the shelves or
checked out. The library staff con
ducted a Search for it, but it didn't
turn up. Presumably it was taken
from the library without being check-

ed out, i.e,, stolen, So I drove to Iowa
City and got a COPY, wrote the paper,
typed it, and handed it in to Mr.
Hsieh's box. My paper and four others
were stolen from his mailbox and '
haven‘t materialized yet. I'm for»

purely by accident, still have my

Recently there has been an alarming in-
crease of parochialism in academic depart-
ments at Grinnell. Certain faculty department
members seem to feel that only those who have
extensively studied in those departments are
competent to comment about matters concern-
ing those departments.

But a liberal arts education is supposed to
create well-rounded individuals~people who
can comment intelligently though not expertly
on quite a variety of topics. A liberal arts

the student body we wouldn’t have a , .

On departmental parochialism and liberal arts 1,

of a liberal arts education, is absurd. Grinnell’s
5&8 is produced not for professional jours
nalists, but for the Grinnell community. Grins
nell’s theater productions are also put on for
Grinnell audiences. To bar those publics from
responding to these products is unfair

Grinnell students are intelligent adults who -
can understand and analyze many diverse
forms of expression They need not limit their ‘
comments to a particular area of interest. '

Indeed they must not be limited to specific

education should make individuals less limited
in their outlooks than they otherwise might be.

No one, one might say, is competent to com-
ment on the 8&3 unless that person has more
training and expertise than the 5&3 editors. No
one, one might say, is competent to comment
on a theatre production unless that person has
more training and expertise than members of
the theater department. No one, in other words,
can comment on anything he or she hasn’t at
least majored in.

areas, Free thought and criticism are essential '
components of liberal arts. Any professor or;
student who feels otherwise should not be at
Grinnell, but rather in 'a professional field or '
more fragmented school. Parochialism and '
liberal arts do not mix well.

Students and faculty should be encouraged to
freely express intelligent, thought-out opinions "
without fear of snide, elitist recriminations by’ , ‘
“experts” in the various fields Only such en-
couragement will create the atmosphere thatt
essential to healthy, liberal arts college.
