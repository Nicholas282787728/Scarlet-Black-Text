Mark Mathabane
the subject of “American
Apanhcid."
Mathabane is the author of
Krt/ﬁr Boy: The True Story ofa
Black Youth’s Coming quge in

book is unique in offering a

of the black ghetto of Alexandra
(near Johannesburg) in which he
grew up.

Mathabane's family lived in

Wﬁl’l)’, at times forced to

scavenge for food at a nearby
dump and drink cattle blood to
stay alive The family also
suffered from recurring raids,
beatings, and interrogations at the
hands of the South African po»
lice. Mathabane came close to
suicide at age 10.

Malhabane taught himself to
read English, a subject not taught
in black schools at the time. He
sought an education despite
bureaucratic barriers posed by the
government and the opposition of
his own father, who protested
Mathabane’s refusal to follow
tribal ways.

The sport of tennis provided a
ticket out of the ghetto.
Mathabanc was fortunate enough
to leam the game with the help
of his grandmother‘s white
employers. He was allowed to
play in certain white tour-
naments. and was noticed by Stan
Smith and Arthur Ashe, who
helped to get him a scholarship at
an American college. He came to
America in 1978, graduated from
college and attended the
Columbia School of Journalism,
and currently resides in New
York.
