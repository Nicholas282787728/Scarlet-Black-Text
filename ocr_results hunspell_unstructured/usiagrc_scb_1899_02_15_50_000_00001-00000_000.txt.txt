The Lecture Friday Evening.

The last lecture of this season's
Y, M. C. A, Lecture Course will
be given next Friday evening at
the Conoregat‘ional church. by Dr.
Frank Bristol. Dr. Bristol is a
youngman, but his fame as an era
toris alreadynational. A little over
ayedr ago he was called from a
pastorate in Chicago, to tliai of
the church which President Mcr
Kinley attends, at Washington, D
C. His brilliant, scholarly and
ﬁnished addresses have givenhim
the highest rank, and not only in
the pulpit but on the platform as
well. His eloqdence combined
with his polished diction remind
many of those who hear him of
Wendell Phillips.

His subject tor Friday evening
is “Brains." This lecture is sure
to plcaseevery one who hears it,

Dr. Bristol's delivery is rapid.
his words ﬂow like a torrent. yet
the thought is perfectly clear and
convincing. He commands the
closest attention from the beginr
ning. The lecture contains scienr
tiﬁc tact. practical suggestion, wit.
humor, pathos and inspiring words
oi patriotism. It is throughout a
strong, vigorous and eloquent plea
for the better education of Amer
ican citizens in questions and mat
ters pertaining to them as memr
bers of the body politic; a plea
for more ot the rig/ii kind of
“Bialns” Dr. Bristol is really
the only great orator on the course
and we are more than safe in say
ing that no one will ever regret
having heard thrs remarkable ad

dress.

Chrestomathlan.

The program was given almost
entirely by new members and
shoued that there is no lack of
good material for future society
work.

joncs opened the program with
an original story, in which he lc»
lated "TheAdventuics of William
Nelson." It was‘not ﬁnished how
ever, and the society hopes to hear-
the remainder sometime in the

 

iuture. A book review by Wylie
was interesting as showing the re’-
lation ot England to her colonies
in Atrica, endliig wnh a few com.
ments on the book as a whole and
Olive Shrclder as a wi'ilcr. Miss
Nellie Clarke favored the society
with a vocal solo, also responding
to an encore. Both selections
were well rendered and thorough-
ly enjoyed by all present,

Heald appeared for the ﬁrst
time before the society nitli a well
written paper on the “Ruskin Co-
operative Suciety.” Externpora-
neuus work was done by Thiei,
Cruikshank and Grier. on examin-
ation markings. etc. The debate
was on the question as to whether
the press should have legal I'cslriCr
iron or not. Mr. McKeag arguing
for no lestriction while Mr. Mcr
Martin proved to the satisfaction
of the president that the press
should-not be without restriction
it only to a limited extent. Mr,
McKeag contended that limita-
tion would discourage all literary
attempt, and that it could not be
entorccd. l-Iis opponent brought
out the fact that the press is lim-
ited by our present laws. which
provide tor the punishment oi
libel. ] E. Parker volunteered
for the negative.

Grinnell Institute.

The Giinncll Institute turned
iltit en nirissc to one of the most
unique meetings of the year The
society- had adjourned its meeting
one week belore on condition that
the Juniors in return for the favor
should give the complete program
the following meeting. The Jun»
iors undertook the responsibility
\villi a zeal which it would be well
if Institute membeis would imi-
tate oncea neck Much time and
thought u ere spent upon the prep»
aration and some innovations up-
on the ustial custom were pre-
settled.

The program was opened by
Stevens, who read a \vellrpl'eparcd
paper entitled, “Notes on the Ru-
banatRcvivul." Hepavcashoii
slreich of Mr. Fitzgeiald, the
translator, and dwelt at some
length on the revival of interest
in Eastern thought and handled
the whole with tamilrarity which
showed thorough preparation.

 

Whitley followed With an ora-I

tion on thc Philippines and tircir
relation to the new position which
the United States is to assume
among the powers of the world.
Miss Atkinson favored the Insti-
tutc with a hell rendered vocal
solo, tor which she was compelled
to respond to an encore.

The cxtemporaneous work of
the evening, given by Crandall.
Waterman and Engelke, was at
once unique and entertaining and
afforded the .audlence considel'a»
ble amusement. Before the dc»
bate the Junior male quartet fav»
ored the society and was heartily
received. The debate was upon
the subjecti‘ﬁcsolved, That lye
ing is never justiﬁable," and was
tvell supported on both sides, Fris
his and Parish supporting the
afﬁrmative and Engelke and Burr
low the negative. After the crit-
ic'srepcrt, by Haliey, the decision
was rendered in favor of the neg-
atlve.

The most prominent feature of
the meeting was the manifest in-
terest of all present and the numr
ber of members and visitors in air
tendance. A like amount of in
terest displayed each week would
go far toward building up society
work in Grlnnell to its former glo-
rious position and would soon
placc Grinnell students where we
could hold otir heads as high over
our liteJnry work as we can over
our athletic Victories,

'Proicssor Noble’s Book.

It IS gratifying to students and
friends of the college to note the
iavorablc reception with which
Prof. Noble's book, “Studies in
Ametican theialure." is meeting.
We take pleasure in printing set/r
eral of the many newspaper comr
ments which have come to him
from various parts of the Country:

"Professor Noble has prepared
a book for schools that may well
be read and studied by many who
have passed far beyond their own
school period. It combines in an
ingenious way the concrete study
of American literature with analy-
sis of literary iorni and the cle-
ments of literary criticism, In a
minor and intidental sense, the
book is a cyclopaedia of American
authors and a compcnd of literary
information. Whatever may be
