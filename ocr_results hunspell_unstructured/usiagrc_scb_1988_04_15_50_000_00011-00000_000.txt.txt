In two doubleheaders this past
week, the Grinnell women’s soft-
ball team proved that it is here to
play ball this spring.

By allowing two traditionally
strong teams no more than a four
run advantage in any game,
against two foes who often invoke
the lD-run rule, the Lady Pioneers
demonstrated their potential.

Against Monmouth, the defen-
ding Midwest Conference cham-
pion and the iavorites to repeat.
the score was 6-5 until the ﬁnal inn-
ing wh‘er’i’the Scots pulled away tor
a 975 victory. Monmouth took the
second game, 72.

the University oi the Fox Cities,
but lost a close match to Lake
Forest, “The team has really come

guys.” In addition to Bridges, the
team consists oi returning let-
termen Ed Minear, Rich Pearce.

against Grand View College on
Monday, Come cheer them on at

Gilbert stated. “Considering we
committed nine errors and had our
ly four hits, we kept it very close,"

Coming into the linal inning
against Knox, the Pioneers were
down 9-4, but rallied with two outs
to score ioui- runs and linished just
short. on, in the second game,
Knox kept an even pace for a 672
win,

“in these games. it was obvious
what we need to do to win: commit
lewer errors and generate more

hits. We're playing at a very coma.

petitive level, but we’can perform
better," Gilbert commented,
Gilbert praised the “hot double
bill bats" of Diana Lewis. Mary
Allenberg, Gini Frazer, Judy

Thorn. and Erin Davison, who
combined lor Grinnell’s hits.

in addition. Gilbert lauded the
battery mates. Freshman pitcher
Allenberg is throwing well and cone
tinues to improve while freshman

ting, tagged out several runners at
home plate.

better," Gilbert said, adding,
“We‘ve proven ourselves that we
can be competitive in every
game-’1 . .. it

Scrummers Crumble
to Newton and LG.

The Grinnell Griffins opened the
spring rugby season with two mat»
ches this past Saturday. Although
they lost both games, the team
played well overall against two
highouality opponents:-

The lirst game pitted the Grillins
against Newton. Newton was
already three games into their
season and their experience was
obvious. The first half was all
Newton. but the Griffins were
stingy with the points and were on-
ly down by to points at the hall.
Newton began the second hall,
dominating the action and control]-
ing the ball, but again the Grittins
were stingy, allowing just two tries
and a penalty kick. Towards the
end ol the game the Grillins came
to life and broke onto the
scoreboard, thanks to the heads-up
play ol Jim Sadler. Sadler’s try
woke up the sellout crowd and
boosted the confidence of the rest
of the team. Grinnell would score
one more time when Vince Furrey
lound the try zone, Unlortunately,

the Grinnell rally ran out oi time.
Besides the play ol Sadler and Fur-
rey, the Griffins' scrum played ex-
tremely well against a larger
scrum.

The second game saw the Gril-
lins lace lowa City. Iowa City
jumped oil to a fast start and realr
ly set the mood lor the rest of the
game, Grinnell’s only points came
from a Dave Gerard penalty kick.
However, the Grillins again were
tough on deiense, and except for
some mental mistakes, played
really well against a well»
experienced team. The game
would have been closer had the
releree not insisted on calling tools
on the most obscure rules while lgr
noring major infractions. But
these things will happen

The rest ol the team. rm sure,
joins me in thanking those oi you
who braved the cold to root us on.
And we hope to see you this Satur-
day when we take on Cornell Col-

On the Schneid

by Eric D. Schneider

Last Monday, the Kansas
Jayhawks won the NCAA basket-
ball tournament to become the
champions of all of college basket-
ball. Immediately alter the buzzer
sounded at the Kemper Arena, the
celebration began The streets ol
iL-awrenco were jammed with
honking cars. The main campus
drag, Jayhawk Boulevard, was
engulled in a sea oi humanity.
students were hugging, dumping
‘beer and whipped Cream on each
lother. and basically yelling their
' heads oil. Kansas frat boys partied
as though this was the zenith ol
ltheir eiristeiice The scene was
l reminiscent oi the celebrations at
the end of World Was 1!, except the
Nazis were a much meaner enemy
than the Oklahoma Sooners All at
this emotional excitement was lor
"12 student-athletes."

The next day classes were
cancelled so that the whole school
could attend a congratulatory pep
rally at the lootball stadium, Over
30.000 student lanatics piled into
the stadium, more than usually at»
tend a Kansas lootball game. The
rally consisted of each player
mumbling trite cliches like. “We
love to be champs and we love
you,” to the wild applause ol the
gathered masses. The rally lasted
one hour, and tor most Kansas
students the rest at the day was
spent resting under the glow ol the
championship sunshine.

The education at a major state
university in the United States was
stopped because a basketball
game was won. On that day the
glories of Milt Newton superseded
the theories oi lssac Newton, The
actions or Danny Manning were re-
counted more than the actions of
Danny Webster, And Larry Brown
was placed on the same genius
pedestal as Einstein, Edison, and
Galileo. God lorbid ii any Kansas
student wanted to learn on the day
alter winning the national col-
legiate basketball championships,

This kind of idolatrous elevation
ol athletes could never happen at
an academic institution like Grin
nell College. If the basketball team
‘won the NCAA DiVision-iii cham-
pionships, no one would know.
School is on break during the tour
nament, and the results of
Division!“ games are usually
relegated to the agate type on the
sports page, Once break ended,
there probably wouldn't be a pep
rally tor the returning champions.
More Grinnell students would
rather go to a protest against the
brutal killings of gerbils in

 

Madagascar than attend any event
extolling athletics. The Grinnell
College administration would
rather cancel classes it a prolessor
won the Nobel Peace Prize, Or if
the endowment reached $500
million. or if the average incoming
ireshman class averaged 1550 on
the SAT. A spontaneous Celebra
tion by Grinnell students would oc
cur if there were a $5,000 reduction
in tuition. 0r ifthe school year ends
ed In March Or if Grinnell College
moved its campus to Malibu.
California.

In Grinnell's own little way, the
successes of the Pioneers are
recognized by the campus com-
munity. At Grinnell, the
humongous pep rally is replaced
with individual acknowledgment
by those Close to the Pioneer
athlete. The Grinnell athlete will
never be put on a pedestal or
garner the same fawning admiral
tion that a higrtime athlete gets on
his campus. The overblown reac-
tion oi Kansas University towards
the Success of their basketball
team demonstrates the overblown
glorification of big-time college
athletics. For most Kansas
students. the only time one sees an
athlete is on television, or perhaps
an athlete is seen speeding around
campus in his new Fiero. The
sightings oi athletes are recounted
with the same enthusiasm that an
orinthologist would tell at spotting
a red-tufted Cockatoo, The athletes
at Kansas are not students. they
are legends, and 30.000 people piled
into the football stadium to catch a
glimpse ol meir legends.

Grinnell College has no sporting
legends, only sporting students,
Grinnell students know that their
athletes are as much studenm as
athletes and can be seen in the
same places as all other students.
The difference between an athlete
and a student at Grinnell is merely
the Choice of extracurricular ac-
tivities. Thus there is no need to ex»
tol one Set of students over another
set. Athletic achievements are on-
ly one small part oi the ac-
complishments or a college, To
cancel classes in order to laud the
basketball team obviously
highlights the success of athletics,
but in doing so any non-athletic ac
Complishments are diminished.
Grinnell College is a campus of
Students and student-athletes,
thus, when Grinnell wins the na-
tional championslu'p. the athletes
must be praised in the same spirit
as any other students' successes.
