Will students have a voice in the curriculum?
South Lounge packed for discussion
with Drake, Frazer and Parsfow

by Marilyn L. Clark

"Can students Participate in Curr
rlculum Decisions?" asked a recent letter
sent by SGA to all students at Grinnell Col-
lege. On Monday, Nov. 23, many interested
students tilled South lounge to near
capacity to discuss this question with
President George Drake, Dean Catherine
Frazer and Morris Parslow, chairman of
the iaculty. The topic included the institu-
tion of a core curriculum, distribution re-
quiremean and changes in the academic
calendar and weekly class schedule

A month ago Joint Board decided a letter
should be sent to Frazer requesting that
Jim Goodfellow. Main Hall president,
meet with her to discuss student
dissatisfaction in curriculum decision»
making which affects faculty
replacements. At that meeting Frazer
agreed to Goodfellow's idea to hold a
forum where the students and the ads
mimstration could discuss the curriculum
process

On Monday night Goodlellow, who was
monitoring the torum, stated its purpose.
He said, “The forum was formed tonight
tor two purposes: to provide students with
an opportunity to directly question the col-
lege administration on the college curr
riculum policy declsmnrmaking process
and to give the administration some notion
of the level of concern over the absence of
student participation in curriculum
issues." Goodfellow emphasized that the
way students are currently brought into
the decisionmaking process is too passive

One current example oi limitations put
on student imput is the policy of replacing
professors who are on leave or sabbatical,
"Students have no direct input in which
departments are granted replacements.
although replacement decisions play a
large role in shaping the course offerings
of each department," Goodiellow said.

“Two curriculum decisions are current-
ly pending which would cause a great deal
of student dissatisfaction." said
Goodfellow. These decisions are the revir
sion of the weekly class schedule and the
institution of requirements. Students have
been excluded so far from the decision-
making process on these issues. The
Calendar Committee, which is a sub
committee of the Committee on Academic
Standing, has already changed the calen-
dar tor next year. No students were on the
committee when this change occurred.
Right now, according to Calendar Commit-
tee Chairman Charles Jepsen, professor of
mathematics, the committee is discussing
revismn of the weekly class schedule,

Recently, the EPC formed a Student
Curriculum Council in order to give
students a voice in the curriculum process.
This council is made up of three chairmen
who were selected among the 22 EPC
chairmen. Phil Guarco was selected by
members Shari Bauer, Ted Donta and"
Sarah SanfordrReinbold to be chairman of
the council. But Goodfellow believes this
will not provide enough means for student
participationg and will not ensure that the
committee listens to student opinion. “If
the opinions of the EPC chairmen do not
agree with the opinions of the Calendar
Committee, there is no room for the
members of the committee to heed their
opinions," he said

Goodfellow summarized SGA's suggeSr
tion by saying that students ought to have
a direct voice in the decisions as they are
made and ought to have a compelling role,
“The issue here is the tendency to forget
that the students are Grinnell, We may be
transient and be here only for four years
but we should have a much larger say on
what goes on here and in decisions that air
lect our academic lives," said Goodfellow.

Over the last few weeks the administra-
tion has met with groups or 25 faculty
members to discuss whether the cur-
riculum should remain an issue for further
discussion, The result of these meetings.
Drake said, "Is that the faculty is
preapred seriously to look at the cur-
riculum," He went on to explain that he
told the faculty to look at the curriculum
“with the idea to produce more structure.
which means more requirements than we
currently have."

He continued, “I would favor the in-
troduction of special courses which would
insure a broad beginning at Grinnell Col
lege." But he emphasized that he did not
favor distribution requirements in special
divisions because "I don't think this would
meet with student approval." Later he ad-
ded, ”My guess is that a structured
number at required courses would not be
very many l'm just guessing . . . but
maybe eight or 12 hours at the most."

Frazer shared Drake‘s opinion on the
subject. "I do think there are some merits
in a more structured curriculum But I
share PreSldent Drake's lack of en-
thusiasm with simple counting up a pat-
tern of distribution requirements, That
strikes me as pretty unimaginative." She
suggested that a “center" to a curriculum
program could be developed. however,
rather than a strict core program.

When asked by one student what was
currently wrong with the curriculum,
Drake explained the discrepancy between
what students should be taking and what
actually occurs on campus. He noted that a
portion, which varies each year, graduates
without taking a science course or courses
in the fine arts. "Our figures show that
around 75o) percent ot all students leave
here with pretty balanced courses. But I
am concerned with the 20 percent — slight-
ly more or less a who might have rather
specialized curriculum but, nevertheless,
a BA. degree trom Grinnell College."

Russell Pierce asked, "If Grinnell is
committed to diversity, why aren't there
any African history or non-western
courses at Grinnell"" Parslow explained
that these areas or study are always under
consideration but that course Offerings de
pend on [acuity experience present at
Grinnell and student interest, “We have
and will continue to talk about these types
of courses," he said.

When Goodfellow asked for a show of
hands on how many people came to Grin-
nell because there were no requirements,
almost everyone present in South Lounge
raised their hands in affirmation,

Another view presented was, as students
pay tor an education at Gnnnell. they have

the right to decide for themselves what,

they should learn and what courses should
be altered in the curriculum, Drake
responded to this by stating, . based on

experience, based on education, based on

profession in which we find ourselves . , .
we in the iaculty presumably have a larger
and deeper idea than the students on this
matter." ,

when Parslow was asked why only a
“trickle-down method" is used to get stu
dent opinion and whether the administra-
tion is afraid of student involvement, he
replied, "Students can get involved in the
dec 5 nemaking process through an in
stitutional lormal way beginning with the
EPC." He went on to emphasize that only
the chairperson of the Student Curriculum
Council has been to the meetings of the
Curriculum Council this semester. "It
takes conststent attendance. hard work
and it's boring; but it you want to get
representation, send representatives,"
Parslow said.

Goodfellow asked whether students are
able to vote on the Curriculum Committee;
Ted Dania, a member of the council, said

impending to a question at Monday
night's curriculum forum is President
Drake. Also listening to student concerns

he did not know, Parslow responded to this
comment by saying, “There is an example
of student ignorance about what goes on
around here. I'm sorry to use the word but
it the person calling the meeting doesn‘t
know that students have four votes on the
committee where are We? You are not in
formed." 7 ' , _. s... ,,
Although student reaction to the discus
sion was mixed, most students generally
felt that if a core curriculum is reinstated
Grinnell will become like any other
mainstream institution, "If Grinnell had
been structured. I would have gone to a
school near my home," said one student
One strong anti-requirement sentiment
was presented by a student who said,
“There's so many at us here at the meeting
because many of us don't feel like we are
being treated as adults given the oppor»
tunity to choose Many of us chose Grinnell
College over a lot of other schools because
when we came, we thought we were adult
enough to choose our classes. I'd like the
freedom to explore and make my own
choices which will affect me for the rest of
my life." Lynn Montag agreed with this
sentiment, "We want to be able to take
more things in the areas we are interested
in A core curriculum will reduce our
choices and will cut down on,individual

tastes and ideas." she said.

In contrast to these views against re
quirements, Eva Baroth said, "If there is
such a thing as a true Grinnell spirit. i do
not see how it could possibly be damaged
by instituting required courses."

Although Drake and Frazer admitted
the possibility that changing the cur-
riculum might affect admissions, the cur-
riculum options should be presented first
and the results judged later. Drake ex-
plained. “It is difficult to say what the imr
pact on admissions will be, It could be
adverse or it might not be But I don't think
that any self-respecting institution can
guide its curricular decisions primarily on
admissions grounds."
