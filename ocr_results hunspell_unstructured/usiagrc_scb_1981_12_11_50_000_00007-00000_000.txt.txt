Echoes’

Empty of you

This room echoes
Soundlessly of soft
Wanderings of Ash
Limb shadows on
Silent walls.

X dark wind
Brushes stars on
Window panes that
Yawn on hinges,
lnhaling night to
Soften this space.
‘ So, here you are.
Inside the shadows You got your independence
Shiver wanting All you’ve striuen for
Breath and words 7 AND FOR WHAT
Receive no peace NOTHING!
(The night moves You’re alone —
But does not speak). . A solitary figure —
A king in a marble palace
With marble floors,
And concrete walls;
With gates of oak
and doors ofpine.
Painted windows
tell your life
of sorrow, grief and misery.l

Untitled

At last forgivmg the
Dumb hollow of
Gesture, the shadows
Lengthen and lean e
Listen to the silent
Frost falling.

— Beth Vilen
Your stations are few
not fourteen, but two,
You make your own,
and let them be 7
You can change that life
Say —
CAN’T YOU SEE!

August Hands

We do not hear the noise between the road and tires
only the endless conversation of our breathing

lifting and falling as the night breeze in an ageless
belltower. As my hand reaches to embrace yours
(fingers apart, the white valleys between softened

by the suntanned roughness of the back and fingers)
tiny crevices merge and deepen at my knuckles

seem to change pattern

the depth —

the shade of my skin alters 7

with each flicker of moon light flitting through the window.
The tones of twilight in a pan of burnished gold.

Your hands now, beneath mine, darker brown,
shadowed, and rougher, the veins

earthen mountains casting shadows of their own;

the blonde hairs on the back glinting silvers

Some spirit dancing among candlesticks

Slowly each of my crecent nails is eclipsed as it
descends over the firm curve between your thumb and forefinger
My fingertips carress the soft underbelly of your hand,
fingerprint ridges dance into the creases of your skin
m secrets undress, create new mystery.

Soft, then, your fingers curl, catch three of mine

and hug them gently in the hollow of your palm.

In this silence much is spoken.

Even as the pulpit of a weathered church

gathers quiet in the middle of the night

an ancient preacher steals soundlessly

into the first pew to whisper secret prayers

and to listen to the wind in the belltower.

NO VACANCY

Sometimes

There Is o neon sign in my mind

thh flashes bright orange

And streamerO VACANCY into the night,
But despite its brillance

It's always ignored

And worry

And hurt

And pain .

Still drive up in their Chavrolets

And insist that there must be room.
“No!"

I scream.

"It's full. can't you see?

There's another place on down the roadt”
Roaringon through the dark

rhoy awoke oil the guests

And I see that it's been of no use

That the warning exists

Or that I ever trled

To put a neon sign in my mind

which flashes bright orange - >
And screams NO VACANCY intoithe night.
