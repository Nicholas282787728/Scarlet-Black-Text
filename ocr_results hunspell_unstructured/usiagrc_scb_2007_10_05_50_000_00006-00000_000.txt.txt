. en 1 hear-d that the 3ch was
going to be assigning a writer
to cover Oktoberfest in the

Arnanas, my hand shot up to volunteer.
I rationalized it by posing the question:
how many times am I going to have the
chance to experience the famous Ger
man festival in the middle of Iowa at a
German settlement colony? Taking the

. assignment naturally had nothing to do
with attending a holiday that I assumed
was, at heart, a thinly veiled excuse to di ink
beer in public.

Oktobeifest at the Amana Colonies
is a threerday festival, which began on
Friday, Sept. 28, and lasted thiough the
weekend The schedule of events placed
emphasis upon the family nature of the
festival. Oktoberfest-goers could take
tours of wineries, lace shops and woolen

mills Shops would be open to show oii‘
their wares to prospectrve buyers Tradir
tional German food would abound for
people to sample.

A quick visit to the website revealed a
series of events planned for the weekend
as well. On Saturday, Oktobeifest at—
tendees would be treated to a display of
brute strength in the ﬁrst annual keg toss
and the ever-populai cross-cut log sawing
contest. Although i decided i would pass
on the bi at-eating contest,I momentarily
considered entering the Miss Oktoberfest
2007 competition. sadly, I lack both a
strong claim of Germanic heritage and a
dirndl (which 1 would soon discover is the
traditional Bavarian dress complete with
lace, ruﬂies and an apron). Although l
lamented missing out on the opportunity
to grasp victory as the Arnanas' ravotite
trauloin,l found the vcr-itablc smorgasbord

exciting if not a little overwhelming
Late on the warm Saturday afternoon,
Oktobeifestwas in filll swing. Despite the
best attempts of the organizers to attract
people to the celebration for more than
just the beer, there was no doubt that that
is what most people were there tor. out of
the car for only a few moincnls,1 passed
a very content-looking man. plodding
along down the walkway with two glass
beer steins hooked into his suspenders,
A large group or University of Iowa
students resplendent in their black and
yellow gear roamed the streets in search
ofrhe Millstrcam Brewery. Later 1 would
ﬁnd a strong contingency ofGrinnellians
lounging on the grass in front ofthat same
brewery, pitchers and cups beside them.
Resting on the bank next to the street,
we hung out in the sun in a scene a little
reminiscent of Block Party.

German beer abounds

lthour a doubt, when one says Oktoberfest, the

ﬁrst image that springs to mind rs either a smrlrng
German woman wielding two frothing steins in either
hand or a smiling German man in lerderhosen wielding
two frothing steins.

Early in my visit.l came upon thc ofﬁcial Oktoberfest
beet tent and paid to gain ln—andvout admission.The ﬁrst
natural stop in the Oktoberfest tent is the table selling and
ﬁlling steins with Millsttcam‘s special Oktoberfest beer,
brewed especially for this event. 1 picked up a large glass
and happrly wandered oﬁ' to explole the nrusic coming
from the Festhalle next dooi.

The Festhalle was clearly the main hub of the festival.
Decorated with stands ottiny lights and tall stalks otcotn
tied with ribbons, the barn-like structure was a strange
reminder that it was aummn despite the warm weather,
At one end oflaI‘ge wooden hall, musicians began retake
their places while I found a tall table to lean on Behind
me, a steady line kept the beer ﬂowing at the small station
nestlcd' in the hick ofthc hall

Lookinv u-ound, 1 found most people crowded rnto
the main ta alcs scattered with beer stains and llﬂlfteiuel‘l
bags of popcorn Some attendees came dressed in their

, rday clothes, Inﬁnitely more entertaining, however,
thc people lounging in all ofthelr traditional Gei—
rtr costumed glorr. leaked caps with leathers of all
kinds glared the heads of older men as next to them sat
women rn drrndls. Most ot thc people dressed up were
a lrttle on the august side; however, the mix orpeople in
the Festhallc ranged i'rom'college students to little kids
and their parents. Everywhere people looked satisﬁed to
sit back and relax as the day went on around them,

After exiting the Festhallc and exploring Am na a
bit, 1 found myself (hit: rand made my way down the
street to the Millstream Brewing Co. and found another
long beer line. While listening to the stylings‘ of Russ
Diet: and the Stray Cats,l spoke with a biker (clad in
leather chaps) about the merits ofeach of the beers.VVe
debated whetherVVindmill Wheat, Oktoberfest or Schild
Brau Aurbt-r was a better choice at this point during the
day. I decided to stick with Oktobeifest. Amused with
the clash ofcultures,l made my way back to a group of
Grrnnellians 1 had found near the brewery's sign assert-
rng its status as “lowa’s oldest microbtewery." Together
we sipped Millstreams offeI'ings and relaxed in the sun,
content to be celebrating the last weekend in September
the Geiman way.

Oktoberfest in Germ

Oktoberfest is an annual festival held in Munich,
Germany, lasting about 16 days starting in Septernr
bcr, leading up to the ﬁrst Sunday in October. it
began in 1810 to celebrate the marriage of crown
Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of SaxerHildr
burghausen.

Since that simple start, the festival has grown
over the centuries to become one of the world's
largest, with about six million attendees each year, in
addition to the (comparatively) smaller celebrations
held throughout the rest of the world, the largest of
which can draw above $00,000.

Beer plays an important part in the celebra-
tions. The festival starts each year with the mayor
ofMunicli nipping a keg and yelling, “Olzaptt isl",
Bavarian for “It's tapped!" Each yeui,locnl breweries
create a special Oktoberfest beer that is both darker
and more alcoholicfl‘he ﬁrst person to have theirbeer
stein ﬁlled is the Bavarian Prime Minister.

or course, with such a festival serting, there
are many pioblcms with people passing out due to
intoxication. To make things easier, there is a term
used for such Oktoberfest goers: “Bierleichen,” or
German for “beercorpscs.”
