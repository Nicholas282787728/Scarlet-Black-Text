A Prepared Peace Is Necessary, Dr. Simons Asserts

Speaker Declares

Against Entrance
Into Present War

By Ruth HackEtL
“Tile countries of the wolld have
prepared for this war and must
prepare for this peace. I am go-
ing to think through the prob-
lems to be encountered in this
next peace based on the experi-
ences of the last war," declared
Hans Simons in his first of eight
lectures given last night in Her»
rick chapel.

Friday Night

Fifteenvminute skits will be fea—
tured at the men-s stag party
Friday night, Henry Rust. presi-
dent of the Young Men's Christian
associanon. announced yesterday.
A fifteen dollar prize will be
awarded by the Council of House
Presidents to the hall giving the
best performance.

Faculty men will ‘also enter the
competition. The party will in-
clude community singing and El-
bert Smith, instructor in lair
guages, will play the organ.

Rust said that the party will
last from 7:45 to 10:45 p. in,
stopping in time for the men to
attend the latter part of the
Colonial Ball, taking place in the
women’s quadrangle.

Settlement of 1918-10," went on
to say that he was not interested
in seeing the United States go to
war, but in seeing this country
stick to her promises and fulfill-
ing them

The last peace was one of un-
fulfilled promises, he said, for
America's interests were shattered
in the failure of the Allies to
adopt Wilson's 14 points. The Al-
lres' assurance of land spoils and
reparations went unrequited, and
Germany’s reconstruction program
was built on foundations of mis-
trust, Dr. Simons stated.

“But it was also a peace of ful-
filled promises. New principles by

which countries should be run
were developed, even though not
used,” the lecturer emphasized.
Following the war, the Allies rear
lizcd the futility of war and be-
came advocates of pacifism and
good will. Also, America re-
turned to participation in world
affairs,

“The responsibility cannot be
found on one side of Europe,"
stated Dr. Simons. He went onto
blame the failure of the treaty on
the inconsistency of its execution,
the difficulties of getting coopera-
tion, and the difficulties arising
from Germany's unsolved prob-
lems.”

‘A Song at Twilight, ’ Tanager Poem,
Interprets Spirit of the Wasteland

Jack E. Wilson looked up from
the curtain on which he was se‘w-

ing in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium. l

'1 ‘A Song At Twilight,‘ " he
said. “is my contribution to the
spirit of the Waste Laird, aschool
of literature talring a rather pesr
simistic view of the world as it
was after the last war and will be
after this one, The school began
with the publication in the early
twenties of ‘The Waste Laud,’ a
book of poems by T. S. Eliot.”

The poem, “A Song At Twi-
light,” written by Wilson, was
published in the February issue of
the “Tanager." campus literary
magazine.

Translating the imagery of the
work. Wilson pointed out that twi-
light, as expressed at the first of
the poem. indicates the sag in
the cycle of civilization which fol-
lows great catastrophies. Up to
the refrain, it has to do with a
picture of the dying age.

The refrain, quoted from vir-
gil’s “Aeneid," pertains to the
Three Fates that govern the lives
of people.

“The latter par 1' he continued,
“represents the minds and states
men of the preceding generation
who brought about the situation
‘Broken clay bowls' refers to (rub
modcd ideas, and ‘Chm‘nel house’
is a death image,

‘The lost of the poem asks the
question, What shall this genera
tron do, now that the things they
belicvecl unchangeable have
changed?” The last four lines pre-
sent the resignation of the gene
erstion to the task of scraping
together the fragments of the old
order, and the striving to build
anew.

“The poem," Wilson stated,
“was mitten in a good quarter
