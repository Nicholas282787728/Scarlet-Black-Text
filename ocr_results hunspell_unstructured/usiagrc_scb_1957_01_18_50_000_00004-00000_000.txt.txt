Pioneers Beaten;

eyes didn't prove much to me
by running away from Oregon
State. I wasn‘t too thrilled in
seeing “Wilt” tangle with the
“mighty midget” Gary Thomp—
sen (510”) at Ames. Anyway,
I heard a rumor that Gary is
really six feet tall but the five—
ten bit is such a good selling
point that college officials at
Iowa State won't let him grow
up. (IS this an example of the
power big schools have over
their athletesitl

One thing we here at Grin-
ncll don't have to worry about
is the subsidization of athletes.
After the college has tinishcd
dropping their sbckcls on-sucb
worthy projects as ripping the
plumbing out 0! old eon-
demned buildings and then
reinstalling it just for exer-
cise (Phy. Ed. A~1 in Mr. M's
Home {or the Aged). and do.
ing research to see it tractors
float, there is little or no
money lcit with which the
coaches rnay bid on the open,
market ior athletic talent.

Even though we are not al—
lowed to entice athletes as do

other schools, we still manage ,,

to emerge each year with some
surprisingly outstanding individ
nail and team performances.
