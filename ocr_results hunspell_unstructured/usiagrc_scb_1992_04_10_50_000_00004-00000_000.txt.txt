Greece trip offers
extracurricular
enrichment

By Gareth Fisher

——_.__.

Over spring break, five profesr
sors, two spouses, and seven students
broke free from the cozy conﬁnes of
Grinnell andembarked onan intrepid
journey across the Atlantic to visit
Greece on the Classics deparunent
Greek Study tour. Our sixteen nights
in Greece were divided into nine
nights in the capital, Athcns, two
nights in the p'turesque mountain
town of Delphi, one night in Olym-
pia, and four nights in the portcity of
Nauplion.

Fach of the students and the three
remaining faculty--Ed Moore, pro-
fessor of English, Sigmund Barber,
professor of German, and Ellen
Mease, professor of theatre, gave a
presentation of a research paper they
had prepared at the relevantsite. Tlte
backgrounds for these presentations
wereasdiverseasthetempleoprollo
at Delphi, the theatre at Epidauros,
the former Mycenaean stronghold,
and the hotel lobby, among other lo,
cations.

Then-ipwasledbyGeraldLalonde,
professor of Classics: our expert not
only on classical but also on modern
Greece, and Ed Phillips, professor of
Classics, our chief organizer.
Lalonde, who was already well ac-
quaintedwith Greece from many vis-
its there, said he “was most pleased
with the appreciation of the history.
literature, art, and archaeology of
Greece by the students and faculty

who hadn’t been to Greece before...
and theirenjoymentof the contempo-
rary culture." Phillips said his main
enjoymentwas‘getting reacquainted"
with sites he had not visited in many
years,butaboutwhich he often taught
in his classes. He also enjoyed a
sunny ferry ride back to Athens from
the islandofAiginasomeofthegroup
visited. Both were verysatislied with
the tour and felt it lived up to their
expectations.

Despite the relatively short time
we spent in Greece, we managed to
visitl‘ourteen archaeological sitcsand
eleven museums. We also managed
to come across a colorful diversity of
interesting experiences: We were
twice initiated into ancient religious
cults, attacked with a firecracker, and
nearly run over on occasions too nu—
merous to mention. Our rented van
washittwicewhilcparked,attd nearly
twice while moving. Two professors
were propositioned by a pimp. A
student was molested by a plant, and
another was atmcked by his toilet.
Two students broke into a castle.
Other students were restrained at a
discotheque,stumbledontoabrothel,
and wentsw'tmming in thesealhe day
after it snowed. We also found a
restaurant where you could eat two
souvlakis and consume two Cokes
for less than two dollars.

Lalonde and Phillips both hope
the college will make it possible for
more Greek study tours in the future,
and who knows what will happen.

GORPers take on Big Bend

By Stacia Bumham and Bill
Zucrcher

For the fourth out of ﬁve
years, participants in Grinnell‘s Out»
door Rec Program (GORP) spent
spring break exploring Big Bend Na
tional Park and its surrounding areas
along the Rio Grande in southwest
Texas. Participants had the opportu-
nity to backpack in the Chisos Moun-
tains and the nearby desert terrain,
and to paddle the Rio Grande through
several of its scenic canyons.

Thevanload of eleven departed from
GORP‘sattractive Harris Center heady
quarters midday Saturday, March
14th, ﬂeeing Iowa’s newly deposited
snowfall and anticipating the cloud
less skies and revitalizing warmth of
Big Bend. “The weather was mag-
niﬁcent after the first two days” come
merited native Texan Carrie Perez,
referring to the recurrent brief epir
sodes of hail and rain which quickly
yielded to the hot Texas sun.

Backpackers trekked along the
park’s well marked trails as well as its
more challenging routes along the pe~
riphcry. enjoying panoramic vistas as

they climbed. The pany was fenn—
nate to have glimpsed an endan-
gered Peregrine falcon, and was less
fortunate to have servedaslnte night
hosts for several javalinas— small
porcine visitors~ which startled the
sleeping campers, but were more of
a nuisance than a threat

Meanwhile, the cancers covered
150 miles, venturing into the lower
canyon which had been previously
unexplored (by GORP). The de
manding whitewater in this stretch
of the river satisﬁed the cancers.
who also enjoyed swimming and
surfing in the rapids and relaxing in
the natural hot springs which can
occasionaly be found along the
riverbanks. The group camped on
both the Mexican and American
sides of the Rio Grande. First—year
student and seasoned uaveller Dan
Shawhan noted the consistent
greener quality of the grass on the
other side.

Like most GORP trips, this year's
excursion toBig Bend offercdphysi—
cal challenges as well as the opporr
tunity for participants to aqnire and
exercise outdoor skills. Minimal
impact camping, orienteering (OK,

so we got off track a couple of times at
thebeginning...).and whitewater tech-
niques were emphasized;

GORP director Dave Zeiss noted the
marked improvement among cancers
as the trip progressed.

With their wilderness experiences
behind them, the backpackers and
cancers reunited for an evening meal
in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. One of the
highlights of the long journey home
included discovering the deep, dark
secrets of San Antonio, where the
group spent the following night. The
group arrived back in Grinnell on Sat
urday, March 28 tanned, toned and
tired.

In addition to spring, fall and win
ter break trips, GORP also offers
weekend excursions. Upcoming trips
include kayaking and rock climbing,
forwhichsomeexperienccis required,
and canoeing and horseback riding,
which are open to beginners as well.
Check theGORP bulletin board in the
Forum for more details, orstop by the
weekly meetings held Thursdays at
noon at the rock garden (Bio seminar
room in the unlikely event of bad
weather). Sounds like a plan!
