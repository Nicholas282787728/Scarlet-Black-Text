Chicago admissions
recruiter let go

‘Students fume after Marlene Jacks is let go
after 11 years of recruiting for the College

EV PETER SULLIVAN

Marlene Jacks, Associate Dean ofAdmissions and Co-
ordinator of Chicago Regional Programming, was let go _
about three weeks ago after having worked at the College
foi 11 years.

Jacks' termination comes particularly hard to minority
students who‘established a close relationship with her.

"She was a mentor and she was a friend," said Cha-
risma Montfort ’11, a board member of Concerned Black
Students. “Sometimes it’l called her she would drivel
think from Davenport and have dinner with me."

The absence orJacks'supporrive presence on cam-
pus will test some urban, minority students willingness
to remain at the College. “Students stayed because of
Marlene," Montfort said. “As far as the first and second
years [in CBS], what is keeping their trust in Grinnell
College>”

Vice President for Diversity and Achievement Elena
Bernal rakes a larger view of the problem beyond the irre
ing of Jacks, “There's been a need for more support [for
minority students] for a very long tlme,"Bernal said.

Bernal pointed to institutional structures as a problem
for minorities rather than simply one ﬁring. “How on
Earth are we bringing social change without changing
those structures?" Bernal said.

According to Bernal, this past week a needs assessment
of the College's multicultural programs was ap roved.
The assessment is tentatively slated to begin a ter Spring
Break.

Montfort speculated thatJacks' absence could adverse~
1y affect the number ofstudents coming to Grinnell from
large cities. “In an urban area like Chicago people are very
connected. It’d be interesting to see how many people
don't come here because of this,” Montfort said.

RLC resignations
initiate new search

BYMARGARETALLEN

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs will have to spend a signiﬁ»
cant amount of time to ﬁnd new staff after the decisions of
Resident Life Coordinators (RLC) Katie Lau and Eric Vos
to step down from their positions at the end ofthis academic

or. -
Student Affairs looks toward the hiring process with ope
timism. After last year’s large RLC turnover, the department'
changed their hiring strategy signiﬁcantly.

“we began to look for candidates who attended peer insu-
tutions...people who would be more speciﬁcally interested in
Grinnell,” said Dean of Students Travis Greene.

A third RLC will be hired for Clangrala.This position was
eliminated last year, but will be brought back to alleviate the
burden of supervising both the Canada and Clangrala. With-
out this separation, a single RLC would have to vie for close

' to 450 students.

Preliminary screening for replacement staffwill begin this
month, and a selective pool ofqualiﬁed applicants will be in~
vited to campus in April. At that time, students will have the
ability to get involved in the selection process by meeting with
the candidates in social settings. _

“Once student involvement kicks in, we’ll narrow dovlm the
candidates and hopefully find a great match;" Greene said,

Lau, RLC to both Canada and Clangrala, decided to leave
Grinnell after two-and-nhalt years to spend more time with
