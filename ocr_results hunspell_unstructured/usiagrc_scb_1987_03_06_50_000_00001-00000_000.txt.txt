Survivors discuss ordeal

by Jill Petty and
Dave Jana .

Memorial services were held Tuesday at
Herrick Chapel for staff members
Katherine McCluskey and Michael Price,
who were killed in a caving accident in
Luana last Saturday night.

Over one thousand people attended mor-
ning and atternoon services for Mcs
Cluskey, 38, an assistant professor of
physical education and geology, and facul-
ty adviser for the Grinnell Outdoor
Recreation Program (GORP); and for
Price, 29, a technical assistant and
operator in computer services. Price died
oi hypothermia. and McCluskey drowned
after a stream overflowed into the 1407feet
vertical cave Huey and five students were
exploring in northestern Iowa.

Shortly after the second service on Tues-
day, vicerpresident and clean of Student Af-
Iiars Jim Tederman held a news con
ference and distributed a two-page state
ment dictated and checked by the
students: Chad Blietz, junior; David Ellin,
sophomore; Matt Stone, freshman; and
Jonathan Andreas, freshman. Almough
the group did not deal directly with the
press following the accident, they later
agreed to speak to the Scarlet and Black.

“Kathy had been discussing the weather
and talking about possibly cancelling the
trip on Wednesday and again the morning
we left," said Andreas. Blietz, the student
trip leader, concurred, adding “We both
knew about the weather forecast...Kathy
thought it would not be as severe and the
system would go south. .Kathy was in con-
trol but she would have let me cancel it. ”

According to the report, GORP arrived
at the caving site at12130 p m, and all par
ticipants had descended around 105 Ieet by
3:00 pm. They had noticed “dripping
water and seepage” on the cave walls, but
were not concerned.

Andreas, Bart, and Price descended
another 20 feet to a second level by 4:00
p.m. When the participants decided to exit
the cave, “they were not initially alarmed
when they noticed,..water dripping down
the passage.” Blietz, a group leader,
realized the water was “significantly in-
creasing” when Ellin made the first as
cent. Blietz and McCluskey decided that
Blietz should climb out next. When he ex-
ited around 6:30 p.m., he was “soaked and

numb.”
Andreas was the third student out

around 7:01) pm. “When I went up I
thought. at the bottom when I started
ascending, I didn't think it was that bad at
all. I didn’t think I'd have any trouble get-
ting t0 the top. It wasn’t until about
halrway up that, 1 don‘t know If 1 was get
ting tired, it more water was coming down,
or else if I was actually getting hit with the
full force directly, but it got really bad. it
was really deceptive,” said Andreas. He
was extremely wet and his hand had
become toocold to remove his own equip-
ment.

McCluskey, Price, Bart, and Stone re
mained in the cave, which was completely
dark except for me light lrom their
llashlights By this point so much water
was entering the cave that it was impossis
ble for the people at the top oi the cave to
communicate with them.

The next person to attempt to go up was
Stone. He got onto the rope but was imr
mediately soaked by water and decided
not to continue and got back down. At this
point, Stone and McCluskey discussed
whether it would be better to remain down
in the cave and wait help. “After I got off
the rope, that was pretty much all that was
on my mind. just because there was no
way 1 was going up...i suggested that to

Shannon McDonald and Liz Johnson will be the two candidates in the

SGA runoff election today. Since neither candidate received a maiority

of the votes cast, a runoff election must be held. McDonald received 201

votes to Johnson’s 190 votes who was running as a write-in candidate.

Kathy two separate times but in her mind
it was just to get us out or there,” said
Stone.

Price then began his ascent and, accorr
ding to the statement, it “was soon obvious
he was in trouble as he began yelling ior
help.” McCluskey had planned to be the
last one out of the cave. but she went to
help Price on a second rope that had been
lowered into the cave. “One of the reasons

she went up was because he was starting to
scream, which she’said was a bad sign.”
said Bart. Because of intensity of
the water flow Blietz, Ellin and Andreas
could not re—enter the cave to help Price
and McCluskey. Blietz said he thought
about trying but “I realized it was
suicide,"

Stone and Bart went into a small room to

Wolfe. waxes on
American culture

by Brian Strause and
John Harrison

”In 19438 there were 7,000 people in Grin-
nell. Iowa, including more than one who

didn't dare take a drink in his own house,

without pulling down the shades first.”
This passage opens Tom Wolfe’s version of
Grinnell history in his biography of Robert
Noyce, everyone s iavorite alumnus
Wolie wrote this piece for Esquire
magazine {our years ago and as a result
became interested in the role of small
towns in the development of the Silicon
Valley work ethic. Unfortunately, Woli'e
was unable to come to Grinnell actually to
report his impressions of the town, but in-
stead was iorced to rely on telephone ac-
counts of the community’s essence. As the
keynote speaker for the Small Town Syms
posium, Wolfe tinally came to experience
Grinnell first hand. He arrived in all his
New York splendor, actually sporting his
trademark white linen suit with leisure
authority ol .lay Gatsby.

Tom Wolfe’s unorthodox style of prose
has spread controversy mroughout the
literary world. The John Barkham reviews
praised Wolfe on the grounds that, “He
punctures the pretensions of poseurs,
hoaxers, and would be pacesetters on the
contemporary scene.” Newsweek
declared “The Electic Kool-Aid Acid Test”
“an American classic.” However, Hunter
S. Thompson, the Duke of Gonzo Jours
nallsm, comments, “Wolie’s problem is
that he s too crusty to participate in his

stories. The people he ieels comlortable
with are as dull as stale dogshit, and the
people who seem to fascinate him as a
writer are so weird that they make him
nervous.” Nonetheless, it cannot be denied
that Tom Wolfe is a Renaissance writer.
Wolfe has written originally on topics
ranging trom the psychedelic movement,
to architecture, to the space program.
From his writings. catch phrases have
emerged as everday household terms. We
are indebted to Tom Wolfe for setting the
705 straight by looking the beast right in
the eye and proclaiming this orgy oi self
indulgence as “the Me Decade.” Similar»
ly, we have Wolfe to thank for “the right
stuff" and “electric kool-aid.”

The diversity of the topics discussed in
the Iollowing interview demonstrate the
grasp Tom Wolfe maintains on American
Culture.

Scarlet and Black:

Just what does Tom Wolie know about
small towns? He has written books about
the space program, architecture. and jour»
nalism, but not much about small towns.
What can you bring to the symposium in
terms of your knowledge?

Wolfe: ,

I’m just a general know-it-all, I’m notall
that iamiliar formally, with small
