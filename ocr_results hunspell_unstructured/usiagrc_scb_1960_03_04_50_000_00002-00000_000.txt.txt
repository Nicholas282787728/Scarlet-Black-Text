The New Council

l

The voters have made their choice for president oil
the Student COUNCIL \\'e backed our candidate becausedle
presented two ideas which we considered of primary rm,

pol-tance. We still consider them so.

An honor system or some step toward such a system:
is a progressrre and necessary step for this college. A‘
stronger Central committee and thus a stronger Student
council is “608552 '3'.

Our only fear concerning 1’ . Krohnke as president
is that the discussion of national and world affairs nill
be on i'ied "overboard." At the risk of being labeled ”antiA
learning” we must state our belief tllat the primary and
most important function of the council is to act as a gov-
erning; and discussion body l'or campus issues.

This is not to say that we disregard such “non-
campus” discussion and action. As students we should be;
heard by others than ourseli‘ That we are, so Sel(lom,§
heard by anybody blrt ourselves is perhaps one at the
major troubles with American students. But we urge care-
'l'ul planning and caution in order that the council and
its president might not forget the organization’s first pur-;
pose.

We invite M- Kl-ollllke to d"cuss the actions of Stirl
dent council in this paper. This is another way by which
the council will be better understood and thus better re—,
spected and activated by the students. ‘

it" issues of non-campus significance are to become a
part of council discu on we also urge that the v rious
sides of the issues be set before the students in letters
to the editor and/ol- feature articles. ‘

if the various possibilities opened to consideration by,
the council are treated in proportion to their immediate
importance, we believe that the next year at Grinnell;
could be one of the most rewarding- years in the school'sl
history.

They Are Not The Majority

We are forced to agree with Mr. Donahoe (see letter
on this page) that the bahyish behavior of certain ilu
viduals at the opening performance of “Macbeth” retlectsl
"upon the manners and judgment of the entire Grinnelll
student group."

That such disrespect and irnorance is reflected upon
the students is unlnrtunate. a. d 2. l a member and a rep-l
resentntive of that student bod he can do nothing morel
in this instance than apologi e for the actions of tllosel
immature individuals. ‘

Our librar maintr s a double card system designedl
so that the llbral Stiil at any time can tell who has a,

the double card system and cannot put their finger onl
material at request. This setup is renderedineffective
when people take bool l our the shelves.

Next week the Tibial) is urging that all books which

"'Suddenly

Reform From Within

The Col'HP, without waiting for any outside force to,

. has taken two rel" important steps to eliminate the
ill tooling which has ex sted. ,

We view tllT‘ “reform from within” as a very good
thine: Not only did it ,Qo a long way toward solving the
problems ol‘ the organ on. but it eliminated much of the
di -u n and bickering which would have sooner or later
come into the open.

We con tulate Di llamsdell and the house presi-
dents l'or their actions. We sincerely hope that their .
ter gorerning organization, AWSB, will consider such

Social Slim-Tori ill?

There has been, in recent weeks, some discussion of
‘lntegrated campl at Grinllell a solution to the
social barl'lers now lstcnt. l

Such ll system would mean. in i s silnplestd'orm, that
ever-V other hall on both north and .outll campus would
be a women's hall while the alternate halls \lould be men's
halls.

It is very easy to say “th
to the Grinnell social problem. But while we agree that
such a . stem would have merit, we must also look at the
many p oblems invol d.

Locked log
racy are but a few of the problems to be considered.

We understand that there are students with solutions

‘ a.

is it the iinal solution

If the idea is to be seriously corridercd, we would sug~
gest a careful study of schools (if any) \lhich have under-
taken such a change.

It must be proved. beyond any doubt, that such a
change w uld eliminate social barriers to such an extent
as to Justify the cost and eflort. And, of course, above all,

it must be determined whether or not the students want
such a change.

Campus Politics ls Sip-coal Case

It's been done before, but that was a decade ago. The
Scarlet and Black obviously has the power to support a
candidate for the Student council presidency, but does it
have the right to do so?

The journalism texts, it is argued. say that a news
paper is free to support candidates. We assume, however,
that this does not automatically include a monopolistic
newspaper, particularly one which a student body is virt»
ually required to support.

The editors and publishers of professional newspapers

have either established or purchased the influence of their
paper. The editor of the 8&8 h s not built up the reputa-
tion of the “Oldest College Newspaper West of the MisA
sissippi liver" and therefore should not use tlle reputa-
tion ill the support of his particular politi all.

The 5&1; cannot reg
political oflice ill the same way that a competitive, pr
vately financed newspaper would judge a professional po-
litician. The editor lit
with nothing but the platforms at the candidates.

Yet the character of the candidates is also important.
Thus an 3&1; editorial can "inform” us about only one
area, platforms, which we can read alld think about for
ourselves anyway.

This editorial, although inspired by the recent cam—l
paigll, should not be applied to the individuals involved

in it. This is a request to deal with two questions
ga rdto future 5&1} pol . (1) should in r. re situations
students request a limit' loll on 5&1} editor al policy? (2)
does the official supporting of a student candidate con-
stitute such a situation?

lTo the Editor:

, At a campaign meeting in our
lllall, it was brought to our at-
ltentlon that part or the sur-
ldcllt council constitution has
‘bccn last for a year and a half.
lTo be specific. it is that part
dealing with the qualifications

lto these problems. But original proposals are not enoruz‘h.r"‘"d “‘Cg‘uanons 0f “‘9 “we“

auditor.

Now it Seems to us that
since the student auditor is or
such vital concern to every
member or the student body,
something should be done
about rccovering this part of
the constitution. Apparently
they (whoever ”they" might
- be) have been “looking" vainr
ly tor the pasl year and a
half.

Well, why don’t “they” stop
just looking and start rc-asscs-
sing his duties and values ac;
cording to present nnanclal coir
ditlon? ' '

This evaluation should be
lsuitable tor and become a
‘ part of the constitution. This
would put an end to the
pseudo-interviews and mystic
qualities or the student audi:
tor.

Anu- all, it’ is our money
ith which the auditor is work-

under whose or what auspices
