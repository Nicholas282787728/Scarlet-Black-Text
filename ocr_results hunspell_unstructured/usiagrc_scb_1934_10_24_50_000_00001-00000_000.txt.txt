Grinnell Draw With Haskell
Brightest Spot in 1934
Football Season

By FRANK BEATLE

Last year, the nearest that the
Pioneer football team came to a vic.
tol'y was in the Haskell Indian game
at Lawrence, Kan., where the Grin-
nell outfit grabbed off a goose egg
tie.

hiday, these same Indian lads play
at Grinnell and if the Fates portend
correctly, Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt's
downtrodden students of iootball lore
will have another chance to break
the jinx which has been prancing in
their midst for the last 14 games.

lndians Wallopcd

Not that Haskell should prove easy.
The 6770 route which Elmer Layden’s
old protege: at Duquesne look through
the Indians last weekend may make
the Kansans appear a triﬂe weak
somewhere or other, but any school
v» ' h can defeat Creighton as Haskell
did, or hold the Oklahoma Aggies to
a 3—point Victory as Haskell did is
lo be greatly feared.

Bob Morgan will be the Pioneer
leadcr in the aproaching battle, Watt
announced today.

Statistics ncccivihg

Statistics of the Drake—Grime“
game last Saturday do not give a
clear picture. The Pioneers played
defensive ball during the entire first
hall, electing to punt on nearly every
first down. Tho steady downpour
of rain made handling the ball a
precarious matter and Kingery, Grin.
noll safety man, did not attempt to
catch any of Drake’s punts. This
fact, coupled with Ubl’s excellent kick.
ing for the Bulldogs, placed Grinnell
in the position of kicking out of
danger each time the Watt—coached
men took the offensive.

rumblcs Costly

Fumbles ruined the Pioneers’
chances whenever they were able to
get possession of the hall in m' ield

Reports that Bernie Trumbull, guard
and center, had fractured a rib in the
Drake game proved to be erroneous
and it is probable that the red—head.
ed boy with the nose guard will be
able to start the Haskell contest. Julie
Bauer is still bothered by an injured
hip, coupled with a charlcy horse
received Saturday,

Tuesday, the Pioneer varsity out-
fit tried several new plays against
the freshmen, gaining considerable
ground, but falling to block accurate-
ly, Clark and McLeod plunged
lhrough the line to get away from
all tacklers several times, but were
not helped to any extent by their
interference,

Horton Shows Promise

Horton showsd up well as starting
end last week and may draw this
position Friday. At the other end,
Anderson, who has been snagging
passes regularly in practice, will start,
and the remainder of the lineup will
be Morgan and Graves or Meeter at
tackles, Sutton and Trumbull at
guards, Fowler, Center; Kingcry;
quarterback; Clark and Bauer or Mc.
Lead, halfbacks, and Bradley fullback

Clark’s punting, Bradley’s dciensivc
play, and 'I‘rumbull’s, Sutton’s and
Fowler’s work.iu the line were out-
standing last wcok.

Haskell Coach

Pleased With Team

LAWRENCE, KamiThcre’s a satis.
lied smile on the face of Gus Wolch,
the Haskell Indian coach nowadays
and if you asked the why ol it he
would say:

“This young Indian team of mine
is on the way up. It’s really coming
through in nice style and is ready
to go places and do things.”

Speaker Deplores Absence
of World Leadership

in Churches

“The Christian college can make a
peculiarly valuablc Contrlbution for
two reasons," dcclaiod President John
S. Nollen yesterday afternoon in ad-
dressing the Mid-West Regional Con.
loronco of Congregational and Chl'lSA
tlon churches on “The Christian Cole
lege in World Leadership."

“In the first place,” he pointed out,
“the Christian college can offer a free
platform In the honest and unhampcr»
Cd dlscussion oi problems involved. . .
In the second place, the Christian col.
logo has, or should have, an atmos-
phci-c pcculiarly favorable [or this
purpose."

Lcadcrsliip Locking

Prcsident Nollen deplored the ab—
sence at world leadership, which, he
asserted, even exists in the church.

“'l‘lierc is not even loyalty to the
Prince of Peace among his proicsscd
followers to halt the crazy nationalism
and militarism that threatens to rc.
peat the madness of 1914," he declar-
ed.

Training Necessary

He concluded with the statement
that, “if men and womcn of superior
ability can bc trained for public 501’—
vice'Y and be imbued with taith in
Christian principles, the world may yet
be saved from “the devastating effects
of our pagan civilization , , .”

Contributions of the Grinncll faculty
to the balance of thc conlerence pron
grain, which ends tomorrow evening,
include an organ recital tonight by
H. W, Matlack, an organ and piano
duet tomorrow morning by Mr. Mat-
lack and Elsie Haggard Ryan, and a
tow selections by lhc malc quartet at

Student Government Given Important
Responsibilities at Chinese Institution

Galt, '37, Describes System
of Schooling Found

A school which has no dean of men
mud in one which thc student gov.

like a fairy tale but that is true of
chching university locolcd near Pck—

ncll sophomore, studied last year.

Galt, who was born and raised in
China, has enrolled in Gl’inncll this
loll as a major in economics. He is
planning on latci- going into rcligious
work, possibly as a missionary.

Students in Chm-go

According to Galt, there is no dean

the dormitories and thc arrangements

When asked about. the educational

methods uscd in Chlra cs uo‘mlaarsd

 

with those used ~lll the United States,
he stated that more and more thc
American methods are being intro-
duced, and that lhc prcsent system
is quite similar to the one used in
America.

Study Formerly [’rivalc

Under the system of education in
use during the Empire, tllcrc were
no organized public schools. Instead
all oi the instruction was carricd on
privately, he explained. Study was
carried on for the sole purpose oi
obtaining a governmental position. In
order to do this, the students had to
pass a rigorous examination based al—
most entirely upon literature.

At the present a system of public
school education is rapidly dcvclop-
ing in China. Pr wry schools have
been established in all villages oi
any size. More Spa 1y located are

the American high schools, while the
