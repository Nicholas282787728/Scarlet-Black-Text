Taking advantage of the three-
day inaugural weekend, members
of Mears and Cleveland Halls took
paintbrush and roller in hand and
proceeded to give their respective
halls new coats of paint. They
joined inhabitants of Read third
and Main fourth in the ranks of
those who have painted over the
institutional white color of their
walls.

Matt Cohen, a resident of
Cleveland, stated that B 5L G has
been extremely helpful with the
painting project. Cleveland has
ambitious plans to paint their
whole hall. At first were problems
of communication with B 8: G and
selection oi colors, Cleveland
dwellers also had to go through a
lot of preparation work. Before
spring break they started scraping
and spackling. However, B 5: G had
to redo the whole spackling job.
”They've been so patient,”
commented Cohen. Last weekend
Cleveland members were finally
able to paint. The lounge and
second floor received layers of
yellow paint.

Cohen explained that the project
was undertaken to build interest in
the dorm and to help unity its
members. He also commented that
residents of the dorm hope projects
like the painting will encourage
proposals recently brought up by
Jim Tedermart, Dean of Student
Affairs, and others, to enable
students to return to a particular
room or dorm each year.

Mears inhabitants worked from
about 9:30 until 3:00 Friday, on
their lounge and second floor
kitchen, Saturday and Sunday they
added additional coats and pretty

well finished up. Marney Wood-
worth explained that they decided
to paint three weeks ago. They
went and talked to Bob .iacobs,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
about decent colors. Then she and
Lee Arnold went to the physical
plant with Susan Crim to pick out
colors. “They were so helpful,
really cooperative," she explained.

The walls in Mears weren’t in
nearly as bad shape as those in
Cleveland. “It hasn’t taken that
long,” commented Woodworth
last Friday. “A bunch of people
turned out after they got up," She
also Commented that the project
was an attempt to get the dorm
together.

interest in painting is one aspect
of the overall dorm renovation
interest that has blossomed lately.
Presently a student committee is
working with Susan Crim, RA;
Harold Horn, Manager of
Housekeeping Services; and Dale
Hawn, Director of the Physical
Plant, to work out a general paint
policy. People involved Com-
mented that discussion and
arrangements were progressing
smoothly. The committee hopes to
have a policy finalized very soon.

Residents of Cleveland and
Mears had approximately 450
different colors from which to
choose their paint. Hawn explained
that the physical plant started
using an enlarged color chart when
students became interested in
painting. 13er workers had been
using an airless spray method due
to a limited labor supply. it the
paint color is not changed often,
this method enables a large area to
be painted very quickly. However,

if the color is changed often, it is
faster to paint by hand. Therefore,
since students are doing the paint
jobs, in all different colors, B&G
has expanded their Color Chart.

The only restriction BM} places
on colors of paint is that they have
at least 75 per cent reflectance
level. “We require that the paint
meets a certain floor on light
reﬂectance so we won't have to
provide lights for dark areas and
increase our electricity bill,"
explained Hawn.

Both Horn and Hawn commented

quite well, Hawn stated that he and

other."

for the event, with others still to be
put together. The Korean
Language Class is sponsoring a
“Crazy Language Table," which is
“shaped under the assumption of
what if the whole world could
understand English, but couldn't
speak. (it)." Kim continued,
“Everyone of the table will speak
some foreign language except
one." The result will be to force the
participants to find some means of
communication.

Various demonstrations and
lessons in various activities from
around the world will take place.
Currently, these include
exhibitions of Navajo dancing,
hula dancing and Hawaiian war
chants, selfrdeiense, and in-
ternational folksong, The S.R.C.
