Holds Meet Spotlight

in Valley Circles.

Drake rivalry will again flourish
in Grillncll this week when the Bull-
dog varsity and freshman track
teams mect the‘Pioneer varsity and
yearlings Friday afternoon. Advance
dope favors Drake in both meets al-
though thc home outfits are given
outside chances to win.

The Grinnell varsity track squad
will face one of its hardest tests of
the season when it opposes the res
juvcnated Bulldog outfit. The Pier
near team came home ahead of
Drake three times in indoor meets
this season but the visitors will
bring a strong outdoor team to break
the series.

souri Valley championship over the
see distance last year by clocking

The quarter»mile should show a
majority for Crinnell with Mark,
Pellcticr and Edwards running and
these men in turn give the Pioneers
the edge on .the mile relay. McWhin-
ney will be Drake's only threat in the
distances and he has twice lost to
Secor over the two mile route this
season. Secor and Pye should be
able to negotiate a victory in that
event while McIlrath is scheduled for
the top place in the mile.

The Grinnell trackmen have chalk—
ed up a record of seven consecutive
victories in dual meets. including an
undefeated record last year, and the
mcntcr is making a strong bid for
the eighth win. The meet will be-
gin promptly at three-thirty with
freshman events following those of
the varsity.

slipped clear off the outer rim of the
dope container this Week when the

ment to come home ﬁrst over the

of the visitors' abilities have been
overrated. It will be the second
meet of the season for the Little Pio<

O Neill’s Play ,
Will be Given

Again in‘June

Selected

as Drama Production

‘Emperor Jones’

for Graduation.

Lhmb to Have Lead

Cast of Semi-Tragedy Presented

December 13 to Act Again; |
Phillips to Appear.

“Emperor Jones,” Eugene O’Neill’s

play w hi c h was acclaimed
wh e n presented in (munch
on December 13, has b o e n

chosen by the dramatic department
as the commencement play to be
given Friday evening, June 6. Clif<
ton Lamb and Richard Phillips will
again portray the leading roles/ and
will be supported by the same cast
that was seen in the play before.

The numerous requests that have
been received for a repetition of the
play resulted in this decision. The
play is a one-act production in seven
scenes, a play of gripping illusion
with unlimited opportunities for im-
aginative interpretation which were
admirably carried out by Clifton
Lamb in the title part. '

Early Success of O'Neill.

”Emperor Jones" was one of
O’Neill’s early successes. It is a
story of the fears of civilization in
confronting the elements, a living
picture of the thoughts of a negro
lost in the jungle of a West Indian
island.

Brutus Jones in the
former Pullman porter who has
escaped from jail where he was
sentenced for murder, and has suc-
cceded in making himself emperor
of the island. thn the play opens,
the time has come when the natives
have discovered his game and have
turned against them. His encounb
ers as he ﬂees in the forest make up
the tliemc of the rest of the scenes.

Lamb‘s Acting Praised

While Lamb's vivid acting was the
major point of praise in the Decem—
ber performance of the play, the
work of Richard Phillips as Smitty
ers, the Cockney trader, was also
highly conmmended.‘

The settings. manufactured in col—
lege c‘lasses under the direction of
Virginia Read, were also highly laud-
ed in the earlier performance.

The cast includes: Emperor Jones,
Clifton Lamb; Smithcrs, Richard
Phillips; native woman, Luella Hall;
Lem, "West Indian chief. Edwin
Liedtke, and Congo with doctor.
Margaret Napier.
