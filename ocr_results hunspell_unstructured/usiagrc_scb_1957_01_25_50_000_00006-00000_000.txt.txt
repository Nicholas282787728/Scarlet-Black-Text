Registration ‘
Cont, from p. 3
examples of possiEle schedules.
Thornton said that this sum»
mer registration system has :the
advantages of allowing students
more time to explain schedules
and will give them the. benefit
of advice trom parents rather
than upperclassmen.

This will also help to pro-
yide an even distribution ol
basic requirements through
the tlrst two or three college
years. Thornton believes that
this will result in more (resh-
rnan students enrolling in
courses which they now avoid.
By knowing ahead of time the

demand tor a particular course,
the problem oi closed sections
could practically be eliminated.
(The same would be true tor
upperclassmen and the plan of
year registration.)

«“I delinltely want’it under. ,
stood that this treshinan regis-

,tratlon would not be final,"
Thornton stated. Freshmen
will still hold regular con-
terenees with their advisers.
At that time changes indicated
by the College Board examin-
ations can be suggested by
the adviser. .
Ettective next year the coir
lege will require all new stu
dents to take College Board
examinations, both the seho~
lastic aptitude‘ test (morning
session) and three achievement
tests (atternoon session).,

Thornton ieels these tests
are the best ol their hind
available and will replace a
number at tests iorrnerly .ad—
ministered, during the New
Student nays testing program.
He estimates that next fall-
the entire testing program will
requin less than one tull day.
Reduction in the testing pro~

gram will mean that more time
can be allotted each adviser in
becoming acquainted with his
students and-it will allow new
students more time for “social
acclimation " ‘
