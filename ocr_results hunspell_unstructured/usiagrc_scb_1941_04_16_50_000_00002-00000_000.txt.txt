0 Policy

It is customary for a new Scarlet and Black
editorial administration to set forth a policy
to be followed throughout the regime.

This tasll is particularly difficult at the
present time because of all the changes
which are in the offing at Glilinell, specifie
cally, and in the country as a uhole.

Further, the attempt at setting forth a
policy is d cult, as any attempt at stating
a generalization is hard. And a policy which
takes a large, over-all attitude must neces
sarily he couched in rather general language.

In spite of the difficulties, this adminis-
tration will adopt two general principles as
guide-posts for the coming year. Deviations
will be made, naturally, and errors in judg
ment are quite probable. But with these
guides in mind some long-range, construc-
tive policy can be achieved.

First, the Scarlet and Black will not grind
the a of any particular group or clique in
its editorial or news columns. Though the
rights of a minority on the campus will be
recognized and respected, only in rare cases
will the demands of such a minority take
precedence over the rights of the students
and the institution as a whole. This in»
cludes all groups, administrative, faculty,

and student.

Second, the Scarlet and Black stands firm
in maintaining its r gllt, and duty, to critll
'ze, both constructively and destructively,
if such criticism is deemed necessary by the
Board This Editor 1 Board is pledged to
invest gate thoroughly all issues before it
lakes a stand. And after such investigation,
whatever is found to be the true state of
affairs will be presented to the students and
administrat' ie officials of the college.

Tllis is a Vita] and necessary duty which
every reader has a right to demand of his
newspaper.

This job will not be easy, and it will re,
quire the cooperation of the administration,
the faculty, and the students. The success
or failure of the Scarlet and Black for this
year will depend largely upon the willing»
mess and extent of this co-operatioli.

3 The Home Strcitchi

Now that twilight evenings are lengthening
and blending into \l arm sta —lit nights,
there is a Very real tendency for students
to slip into a pleasant stupor. Hard r llities
01' the classroom and the g adebool; are
'orsalx'eii for more pleasing pulsuits illto the

elds of romance and revel-y. Pen and note
book give pay to golf club and baseball,
and development of the physical side of our
being takes precedent over the exercise of
our minds. No longer do we sit in tile class-
rooms with expressions of profound interest
instantly on call when the prof glances our
way, but rather the art of sleeping surrep-
titiously or the appeal of the great outdoors
command our faculties. Spring has come
with its blessings and temptations.

Unfortunately, there is a dark gentleman
lurking in the woodpile. Scientific statistics
show that the devastatingly lovely effects
of spring 2 ‘e entirely lost on ladies and gen—
tlemen over 50 years of age~especially col»
lege professors. Though the student may
falter iii the home stretch, the professor,
just catching his second wind, finds his
mental powers to he never so fertile and in-
genious as in the spring time of the year.

What is the moral of this? We might fall
back on a slightly antiquated proverb to
make our point, “A stitch in time saves
nine.” In more modern val-bilge, we recom-
mend a judicious measure of concentrated
study in the next five weeks before the
black days of semester exalns.'

nated this semester would be

Power for operation of rides

failure of the Vzrsity club this

social organization for the entire
college. included in Miles’ re

"We're in a social rut!" said
Pearce. “Let’s do something about
it!”

Anderson's resignation as fi-
liancial head of the Moodereh
son~Vranek show came as a sur-
prise to the council. Explaining
that he could not receive the Se!"

committee, Anderson recommend—

him. Appointment will be made
