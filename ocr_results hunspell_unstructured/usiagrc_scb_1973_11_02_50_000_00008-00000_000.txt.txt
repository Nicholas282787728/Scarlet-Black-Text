Booters Win I, lose I

by Ron Spritzer .
During the past two weeks, the Gr-
innell soccer team gained one vic-
‘tory and sutiered one deieat. On
Wednesday October 17, the team
deieated Knox at home by a leo
score. It marked the Pioneers first
win over Knox in iour years, ending
a seven game domination by the Si-
washers. LastSaturday Grinnelllost
to Monmouth 2-0 in a game that is
still being discussed. (See adjoining
article) The pioneer record is now
2-5 with tomorrow's game at Coe
as the iinal oi the season.
The Knox game was well-played
.by both sides, and ieatured tight
detensive play. Knox played a tough
manvtOrman defense. which kept Gr—
innell in check until the middle oi
the second half. With 19 minutes
remaining, haliback Wade Leedrib-
bled past two Knox deienders, and

passed on to Dave Calvert who beat
the goalie ,lor what proved to be
the winning tally. It was then up
to the delense to hold on to the
win. Grinnell iullbacks Roger Kumr
ler, Glen Cushing, Rich Lancaster,
and Ron Spritzer combined With fire
st year golaie John I-laign to control
a Knox oliense which had scored
iive goals in the previous meeting
oi the two teams. Their job was
made easier by the strong play
ot halibacks Lee, Don Noyce, and
Phil roster.

Knox is accustomed to playing on
a narrow iield and Grinnell’s iull
size iield may have hampered their
attack. The Knox outside iorwards
and halibacks had problems with
their passes and shots. Tnelr ma.
]or scoring threat, senior center
iorward Dave Baumann received
iew opportunities to score, largely
due to Kumler’s steady play at cen-
terelullhack.

The iinal game in a ZZ-yearold
series between Grinnell and St.
o_l_ai_will be played on Ward Field
Saturday at l' 0 pm. St, Olaf is
leaving the MidvWest Athletic Con-
ference this year, The Oles have
a [4-4-1 edge over Grinnell in the
series which began in 1952. Last

year St. otai won 5577. The 0195 .L

are 472 (4-3 overall) in MAC ac-
tion contrasted with Grinnell's 0-6
‘record (0-7 overall). Over break
the pioneers lost 1676 to Beloit
and 41-2 to Ripon, Tomorrow’s
game is the ‘final home game of
the season,

The defense shone throughout the
Eeloit game holding the Buccaneers
to zero passing yards and to 257
rushing yards. But, oliensive mis-
,takesﬁtour fumbles and three pass
interceptions -- kept the Pioneers
irom moving the ball with any con
sistency. Quarterback Paul Delaney
scored Grinnell’s only touchdown
on a Zryardrrun after Belolt was
winning 1670. Edd Bowers, team
coach, said, ”I was very satisa
tied with our defense...But, we a-
gain iound ourselves iighting ior
our lives because of offensive mis-
takes,”

Ripon ran the opening kickoff back
88 yards ior a TD against Grinnell.
At the end of the first quarter they
held a 2070 lead. Tom Geotz’s nlav
at haliback was abrlghtspot ior Gri-
nnell during the rain soaked game,
He netted 116 yards in 28 carries.
Delaney was 7 ior 24 and 52 yards
in passing. Bowers noted, “In some
respects, this was one of our bet-
ter games. Our line blocking was
improved and we had some good
drives on defense we held sev—
eral times.” At one point Grinnell
marched to the Ripon l-yard line,
only to surrender the ball ondowns
Grinnell scored its two points on
a safety of! of a Ripon fumble.

Bowers commented, “'i-‘he offense
needs a lot of work on timing and
finesse. Many of our mistakes are

the direct result of our inexper-
ience and oi the shuiiling we have
had to do because oi injuries and
academic pressure."" They rank
iourth in team oiiense, but are eigr
hth in team defense Grinnell is
last in both categories.

It is gratiiying to learn that your

personal letter that he was slightly
upset at some oi the things pre-
viously said in view From theSlder '

on Grinnell athletics which lasted

column. The opinions of the staffs
of Grinnell College in regard to
the athletic program at Coe Coll-
ege were expressed to me in 3 st.-

held by myseli and others, despite

The idea expressed by Monmouth
soccer coach that Bill Urban that
soccer Is a game where roughness
is permissible is ridiculous. Grins
nell is used to legally permissible
play, but football-style tackles and
the kicking of players isn’t in the
rules As ior'saying that the Mons
mouth soccer team was more vice
toryehungry than Grinnell, this too
is ridiculous. Roger Kumler,thesie
lent star and captain of the Grinnell
boaters, said, “The team felt that
Monmouth’s style oi playing soc-
cer.,.we don't feel its really play»
lng soccer.”

Even in Europe, where crowds
of thousands of fans and occasions
ally iighting occurs, the game is
played with a style that doesn't
rely on roughness and brute lorce
as a means to an end. The Europ-

eans, and the rest of the world
class teams ior that matter, play
ior sharp passes and dribbling.
While admittedly Monmouth andGrr
innell can’t equal that standard the
eir is no need for any team to ems
phasize rough play during a game.

As lor not playing Monmouth again
i feel that this is loolhardy at best.
it should serve for Grinnell as in-
centive to go out next year, play a
clean game, and beat Monmouth
Remember, eventually David will
conquer Goliath,

What with the addition of the‘suc-
cer question next months MAC meet-
ing at Coe Should be interesting,
In addition to the possibllity oi new
teams joining the conierence the
question oi the policing of the exe
isting teams will be at the top of
Grinnell’s agenda. The Grinnell {3,
Culty, and it is the school faculties
that control the league, has voted
to push for a tightening of the rules
on recruiting and also they voted
in iavor oi a possible split in the
conference. The MAC is in the
midst of trying to stay as “pure”
as possible without adopting some of
the anachronistic policies of the
NCAA, and, and Olympic Commit-
tees, .

GRACELAND, IA.~-Mary Jane E-
lan scored four goals In two games
as Grinnell’s field hockey team came
up with Its best day in the history
of 'the sport at Grinnell last Sate
urday. »

Playing morning and aiternoontilts
with Graceland and Iowa Wesleyan,
the women came up with a 171 tie
and a 5-1 victory. The team, long
accepted as a sure loser, is now
2'471, ‘

The iirst game pitted the pioneers
against a tough Graceland team, and
after two-thirds of the contest had
been played, there was no score.
The goalies had been superb, Grin-
nell goalie Leanne Schwartz came

3 up with a great save in the second

period
Graceland’s strong centerrlorward

drew first blood in the third, and
final, period, soon afterwards,

Graceland had a chance to wrap up
the contest when Grinnell’s Nancy
Breul found herself up against Gram
celand's star forward on a "pens
alty bully.” A goalrsaving maneur
ver by Breul kept the game close

and set up the climactic Iinish.
With but to seconds remaining,
and the spectators in a irenzy, the
Pioneers scored the dramatic eq-
ualizer, Elam, unassisted, crossed
the penalty line and whipped the
ball into the net irom 15 yards out.
The clock ran out on the stunned
Graceland squad and Grinnell had
what has to be called a moral vice
tory,

' The afternoon opponent was Iowa

Wesleyan, which had losttopowerful
Central Missouri State University
7-0 in the morning game. The to-
vored Pioneers went right to work,
scoring in every period. Elam st~
arted the scoring with an iinas'se
isted firstrperlod goal. Marnie Fox
contributed a score in the second
period and the Pioneers ,were up
270. At the start of the third per-
iod it was Elam again, this time
assisted by Debbie Smith. After
