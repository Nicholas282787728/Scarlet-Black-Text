 

The case for
unlimited tenure

Two statements on Grinnell’s tenure policy have been
drawn up recently. One, written by President A. Richard
Turner, includes a proposal for each department to retain at
least one untenured slot, unless its oldest member is within
five years of retirement. The other, signed by 31 tenured
faculty members, favors unlimited granting of tenure to all
qualified faculty members on the basis of merit. Unlike
Turner's statement, the tenured faculty statement opposes
tenure decisions being inﬂuenced by contextual aspects, i.e.,
the number of tenured faculty within a given department.
Though arguments on both sides are persuasive, we think
the unlimited tenure policy, for now, is best.

That policy has several advantages over the other, many
of which are noted in the tenured faculty statement. First, if
it leads to a higher number of tenured professors in the
future than limited tenure, then it will promote more
academic freedom of expression. Second, it serves as a
stronger attraction of qualified candidates, many of whom
expect job security from Grinnell because the de-emphasis on
publishing here may make job relocation elsewhere difficult.
Finally, though it promotes more anxiety on the part of some
untenured professors, it encourages greater motivation to do
well and to continually self-evaluate performance.

THE PROBLEM OF more “deadwood,“ incompetent
tenured professors is not as great as it might seem. A
common misconception is that tenure comes automatically
with the passage of time. Rather, each professor is evaluated,
and the unlimited tenure policy in no way entails lowering
standards for tenure. It is also incorrect to assume that a
professor’s viewpoints and methodology remain unchanged
with time and thus inevitably become outdated. When it
comes to college professors, especially those as qualified as
the ones Grinnell hires, it is possible to teach an old dog new
tricks. Furthermore, it is possible to remove a tenured
professor. on the grounds of incompetence, though this is
rarely done. Most significantly, the tenured faculty
statement includes data suggesting that unlimited tenure
will not lead to a much larger number of tenured professors
than limited tenure.

Turner's statement outlines several advantages of con-
sidering contextual aspects. One is that it allows more
ﬂexibility to adapt to changes in curriculum. However,
because Grinnell is solidly committed to liberal arts, changes
in curriculum will be narrow and satisfactorily handled by
the ﬂexibility of an unlimited tenure policy. Another is that
it provides more “new blood.” Yet, as already mentioned, it
is wrong to assume that unlimited tenure results in too much
old blood.

THE MAIN ADVANTAGE, according to Turner's
statement, is financial. Limited tenure keeps salary costs
down and allows faculty cuts to be made without interference
from tenure contracts in times of hardship. Though the
policy may lead to savings in salaries, arguing that it will
help in times of hardship holds little weight right now. Some
small liberal arts colleges are in trouble but Grinnell remains
strong. Its enrollment went up this year, its endowment is
large and its committment to liberal arts is firm. It is too

early to implement a limited tenure policy; the costs out-
weigh the benefits at present.

It is conceivable that limited tenure, despite tenured
faculty statement data, will lead to a significantly smaller
number of tenured professors than unlimited tenure, and
thus to more flexibility for cutbacks. And it is conceivable
that future hardship will be so great that it will be necessary
for Grinnell to sacrifice the benefits of unlimited tenure,
switch to limited tenure, and than make cutbacks. But, as
even Turner‘s statement notes, such hardship will not come
as a surprise. Adjustment of tenure policy, if determined
useful, can be done in time. But the time is not now.

Quad

Dual food fare could encourage. academics

To the editor:

As two concerned members of
the Grinnell College community,
we believe there are two serious
problems facing Grinnell students
today. ,

First and most importantly is the
indolent and apathetic attitude of
the student body toward their
studies. Permissiveness and ex-
panded personal freedoms are
taking their toll at the expense of
unassuming young minds. This is
reﬂected by the overall decline in
grade point averages. Every
semester the number of students
making the Dean’s List (35 GPA)
markedly decreases. Something
must be done to regenerate in-
terest in academics. Discipline is
called for.

The second issue presents both a
problem and a solution. The
problem is the mediocre bill of fare
we are offered in our dining halls.
Every repast reminds us that we
are indeed living in the “Hog
State." Brilliant minds should not
be forced to suffer this injustice.

In response to these problems,
we offer a logical and all-
encompassing solution. We
propose two separate menus,one

for students maintaining a 3,5 or
better GPA and the other for those
falling below this standard. Honor
students would receive steak night
four times a week (with seconds),
wine with dinner, homemade
desserts, occasional aperitifs,
favorite foods on request, and
never any beef rolls.

The other students, though
dining side by side with the honor
students, would continue to receive
the same unattractive and
tasteless meals. A quantitative and
qualitative reduction in their food

would compensate for the in-
creased expense of the honor
students‘ new menu. This dual
class system would provide im-
petus for greater academic per-
formance while providing an at
tainable solution for those students
regularly sickened at mealtime.

Students of Grinnell, we offer a
plausible escape from this culinary
persecution. Doing well in college
may not get you a good job, but it
might get you a good meal. Rachel
Spector and John Anson

Finds Cost stance oppressive

To the editor: At first I did not
want to dignity Curtis Cost’s
comments with a response, but I
find as his tiresome tirade con-
tinues that I must respond to such
blatant racism.

Mr. Cast: your vehement
paragraphs do not merely repel or
disgust mhthey oppress me.
Consider this condescending,
consider this objectionably put, but
please, sir, consider this a total put
down. When one becomes so

arrogant as to define the problems
of society in terms of one’s own
manifold problems and denies the
struggling commonality in favor of
an exercise in sell’gratification,
one loses any 'right to be heard.

It saddens me that such tripe is
given the dignity or newspaper
space; rather, such space should
be given to call for a happy union
against unwanted racist ope
pression, Judy Packer

Asks input for SGA activism

By Jon Ncidcrbocl:
The past dozen weeks have seen

an eventful, somewhat historic
resurgence of political activism on
Grinnell’s campus. Hundreds of
students, faculty and staff have
vigorously discussed issue’s that
affect them: college ownership of
stock in corporations that do
business in South Africa, im-
plementation of Affirmative Ac-
tion, and Kent State, SGA was
heavily involved in these issues
and much that was accomplished
might not have been possible
Without SGA'S involvement.
However, for the five remaining
weei ‘ this semester and for the

 

"fal‘y semesters ahead, there are
m;any areas crying out for the

 

attention of SGA and me rest of the
campus community. I submit the
following to provoke discussion:

1) SHOULD son spend your
money the way it does? 325,01»
goes for concerts, $11,000 for
movies, $10,000 for the 5&3 (this
paper you are now reading cost
SGA 19 cents per copy). $6000 for
hall funds, and so on (ask at the
SGA office for a complete budget).
Or should SGA use some of its
$85,000 to hire additional faculty
members or visiting lecturers in
areas the college, in our opinion,
doesn't provide adequately tori
(This has potentially far-reaching
implications for student power).
Can you think of any innovative
ways to spend money to better
serve students?

2) Should there be a Student
member of the Board of Trustees?
The recent South Africa issue
points up the fact that the trustees
have ultimate power over many
matters students are very con-
cerned and involved with. Should
we have Someone on the Board to
insure that student views get a full
hearing“!

”SHOULD THE college grant:
credit for education that takes
place outside oLthe classroom to a
greater extent than it does now'!
Growing use is being made of in-
ternships. Should practicum credit
be g nted for participation in
act'v es other than theater or
music?

 

4) Should students have more
than an “input” role in faculty
and staff hiring and promotion?
Specifically, should students be
given a formal vote in decisions on
these. matters? Should students
take part in the initial selection of
candidates to be further con
sidered and invited to campus?

THINK ABOUT these topics and
come up with other topics. It is
high time that students begin to
discuss, to a greater degree,
specific ideas for improving the
Grinnell experience and for in»
creasing the role that students
have in determining what the
experience is. No, this is not a plea
to return to the late ‘SD'Silittle
meaningful change was achieved
then, anyway. This is a push to
embrace the late ‘70’s.

In closing, remember that unless
people who consider these matters
worthy of SGA attention speak up
and-or run for hall rep
in January elections, nothing will
happen and SGA will be unable to
act as the bargaining agent and
active spokesperson for students
that it should be. What has hap-
pened often in the past is that
students who have relatively
narrow views of what SGA should
do have gotten control of SGA, and
thus SGA has not appealed to more
politically active students. I ask
you to very actively help to assure
that the vicious circle does not
continue.
