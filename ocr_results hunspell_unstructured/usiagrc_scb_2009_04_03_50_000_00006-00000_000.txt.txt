,Choral virgin no more

BY]. FRANCIS BUSE

Though the texts were primarily Latin and the subject was
often Catholic mashtwo subjects alien to a large number of
Grinnellians—the Tallis scholars nearly filled Herrick Chapel
for a concert this past Wednesday. The group of ten vocalists,
directed by the spritely Peter Phillips, brought a satisfying
and moving sample of classic choral music from England to
Grinnell.

The nine pieces pertormed by the scholars and composed
by a smorgasbord of 16th century artists come from a unique
juncture between two points of musical development, Rennai—
sance and Baroque. The program notes were dense with ties
scriptions of the pieces' musical subtleties and influences on
future developments in “secular, opera and instrumental music"
in their role as “proto-Baroque experiments."

Phillips acknowledged the difficulty many audience mem-
bers might have interpreting the music, calling two pieces “ex-
tremely complex mathematically" in a break between songs
during the middle ofthe concert. While describing the ethos
ing, overlapping and inverting interactions between the disc
parate groups within the choir, he noted that “you won’t hear
thisinobody can. But that’s how the pieces are written."

The atmosphere was relaxed, and the audience seemed able
to enjoy the music without an encyclopedic knowledge otibth
century choral music,Thc pieces encompassed a wide spectrum
between soft and loud, slow and quick. The presence ofa male
alto added a uniqueness to thc event beyond its inherent tee
markableness.

The highlights ofthe show included the pieces “Ave Maria"
and “Nescicns Mater" by Alonso Lobo and Jean Mouton, re-
spectively, the most musically unique of the pieces due to their
aforementioned complexity. The audience enjoyed “Missa Bell
Amfitrit‘ alterat", a parallel of Catholic mass, to the point that
they applauded between each movement, visibly surprising the
Scholars.

Still, to the untrained car, the differences could be hard to
distinguish and the music could seem mundane. An elementary
school-aged boy was allowed access to his PSP after the third
song, and spent the rest of the concert watching YouTiibc vide
cos. Another student, looking conspicuously drowsy, rested his
head several times on the pew in front ofhirn. It was a concert
to calm attendees and allow them to think, not necessarily to
awaken and excite.

I went into Herrick something of a choral virginil have
enjoyed the Tallis Scholars via Pandora and CDs checked out
from Burling over the past year, while also attending nearly all
of the Grinnell Singers concerts, But the sonic elegance dis-
played by some of the finest vocalists in the world was overs
whelmingly beautiful and mesmerizingly balanced, with or
without extensive knowledge otthc music being performed.

As the last performance of the Griniiell College Public
Events Committee this year, the Tallls Scholars proved a note»
worthy and solidifying end to a program that has included the
likes onynton Marsalis and IHII’IUIH'KII’“, Marsalis brought
us the lights ofthc city and IntieIllimani the sounds ofChilean
folk music, but the scholars showed us the sweeping grandeur
some modern ofniusic’s origins.

When did you ﬁrst start to ﬁgure out how to create this
style of poetry?

I was working at all these little magazines [in Los Ange-
lcs] and making poetry on the side. It was a good gig,I was
making money ...Whea the Watts riots happened. Bud Schule

_ berg [a famous screenwriter and novelist of the 50's and 60’s]

went down to Watts and started the Watts Writers Workshop,
I covered this story at Los Angles City College where these
two poets [from the workshop] came. There was the defense
minister for the Black Panther party and this man Alvin Saxon
who called himself Oienke at that time there, He had gone to
UCLA and majored in biology and physics, but he was a poet,
And I heard him mad, and it just blow me away. I had taught
myself to unite poetry by writing sonnets, villanclles, haikus,
and sestinas because I thought that was tht: way to do it,

But when I heard this pocmibccause his father was in the
churches. the Baptist ChllrcliesiI couldn’t believe the eneigy
and the metaphors and the rhythm] didn’t think you could do
that in poetry 1 said,"Listeii man,where do you go to learn this
poetryi", because all these guys in Venice [Beach] were these
white guys who loved the fact 1 could write these totm poems.
And he said, “In Watts.”

I went out there and threw away all my sonnets. A bunch
of great musicians were out there, and that‘s where I found my
voice. The iambic pcntamcter bears like the heart. but when
you really snidy the language of everyday people, that's not how
they talk. I started substituting Lincs orJohn Coltrane for hch
ameters, ba ba ba do boo da boo ha and starting to make that
the line. syncopation,you know? Like a Miles Davis solo.

Was Miles [Davis] the ﬁrst one you felt that deep cone
nectjon with?

I had a deep connection with my brother, who was a jazz
dtiimmer.When I was in high school, he would be doing these
paradiddles [a type of drum exercise] all day,
and I thought, ifhc could do these pamdiddles,

I could shoot 500 jump shots, because I was a
basketball player then.

Miles was the greatcst artist I had a cone
nection with, though. I learned so much from
him, not only about art.l was interviewing him
one time and I got a phone call and got in a
long argument With this guy. After I hung up,

Miles said, “Why'd you talk to the motherfer

kcr so long?"I said, “What do you mean?" He

said, “You know how they have an on and off

switch on the television?" I said, “Yeah." Isle

said, “Cut the the rnotlrerfnkei off. Cut ifoff,

cut it off, Hang up the inothcrt’sscking phone. You could have
stopped talking to that mothei‘fe -et five minutes ago.” I just
said,“Oh."

I kinda do that with people now. What do you need all of
this extraneous conversation for? I did that to a friend of mine
before coming herc,and he said,“I understand, that's that Miles
seet ," And Ijust explained that it wasn’t that I didn’t want to
talk to him, it's just that I've got to do other stuff.

ltMiles liked you, he’d do anything for you. lfhc didn't like
you, that was it. It wasn't arrogance, it was confidence. I heard
him talk to Clint Eastwood and he talked to him like a dog
about his latest moVie at the time,“Bir ."

That kind ofrci-ninds me ofwhat they said about Obama
early on the campaign trail.

He was saying, “I don’t do that, 1 don’t kiss your ass.”Iii my
early essays, I was saying he was going to win everything. In
January 2003.1 said he was going to beat Clinton, and Moe
Cain. People don't understand that there are a lot of Africans
Americans, women and men, who are like Miles. We learned
from Miles,

I remember I was standing in the airport, and I was wait»
ing in line. This white guy comes, obviously he’s a bnsiness-
maii.Thcre's a whole line behind me, And he says to me, “Are
you in line, or are you taking up space>"l say,“You know what,

Vining/part, Quincy Tran/IE, LAUREN ‘ SUMULONG
mothetfercket, you better get to the back of the line, or I’m go-
ing to pour you like lava."

Ijusrwant to be equal to cvcryonc elsc,lfyou don’t treat me
like a human being,I'm just not gonna deal with you

I feel like that comes out in your poetry. You're both an
AfricaneAl-nctican man, and you don’t forget that, but you
also see that you’re a part of this community of poets. It’s not
either/or, it's both/and.

I feel that way. My mother, who will be 92 this yeat and is
about 5'2”, won't take nothing from nobody. I grew up seeing
that attitude,I never have felt inferior to anybody. I tell people
that all the time. I taught for 32 years, and I would hear these
whispers being my back, yoti know, ‘Qiincy's so arrogant,"1
would confront them. I would say,“I'm not arrogntJ’n-r conﬁe

dent. I've been conﬁdent for along timer I was
a great basketball player, and 1 was confident
then. Your idea of equality is my down here
and you up there. I don’t buy into that,"
That's Obama, and that’s me. I was so hape
py to see a politician like that, who says. you
know, that he's a black guy but that's not it. I
read,-l know my history, and I love the Unitcd
States,I know about this stuff. I’ve participat-
cd in all this stuff, but I'm going to tell you if
it’s not working. In think you are stupid, I'm
going to tell you that, black guy or whoever,
I've told people that who want me to write
their books. Black guys, and white guys. 1 tell
them that they gotta tell me the whole truth. It’s got to be a
literary project. I’ve got billionaire fiicnds who I treat like that,
good friends, My wife and I go out to New York, and we see
them, because we like good wine, and good food, and we have
great conversations.That’s what rt's about. It’s built on that.

There's one gtiy I know, I won't say his name, but he's one of
those guys who will say anything to you. And I’ll tell him: “reek
you."And hc’ll say,“Oli yeah, feel; me?“And I’ll say,“Yeah, F-ek

lou. ,

5 I just want human relationships with people, whocycr they
happen to be, poets or whatcvcr. Ifl don't agree with yon, I'm
not going to ambush you, but I'm going to tell you what I be—
lieve. And you can say what you believe to me, and our relae
tionsltip is like that. That's the way a good relationship has to
he. That's howl am with all these people, Miles Davis, Jimmy
Baldwin, cvcn Marlon Brando when I met him during the
Watts Writers Workshop...

He (Brando) actually introduced inc tojames Baldwin. And
the first night Baldwin and I met, we got into a big argument.
We got in a big feeking argument about nonviolence,..

After a while you start to feel like you belong in this group,
You may not have a dime, but you feel like you belong thcror
