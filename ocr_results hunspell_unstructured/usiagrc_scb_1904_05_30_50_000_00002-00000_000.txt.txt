{E of points won at state meet
has given [diva College tin cntile-
ly lie-ti sensation. tlte ﬁlteen
year; of Griimcll‘s connection
ivtth the itltchuilcgiatc
Amateur Alltietic Association she
has never until the season just
closed [dllﬂﬂ below third place
and seltlon if ever has she tailed
to accomplished more than the
avclage scarlet and black sup»
paltets had hoped to., The year
ot grace nineteen hundred and
four, however, has not only seen
her lose several points which she
had a right to expect in View
of previous pclformances but
it has brought about lter dc-
feat for fourth position. And yet
it would not be fair to ittier that
in Grinnell's athletic career of
thorough that nothing
ltatl been laiel in our way to pre-
pare us [or this latest and, let us
hope, this inst tilighting of out
athletic ulnblllulli. Out history
has been eh; noticed by ntnner
otts though cretlnnhle failures and
these hate fallen to our lot ire-
qttetttly enough to put us in pt'opet
condition so to speak for the more
or lesseheertul reception or the
title to ﬁfth place.

But if Saturday's meet resulted
in one disappointment which true
Grinrtell sporttnansltip can accept
gracelully it brought to light anr
other to which net-friend of loua
College can easily be reconciled,
for the work and the wisdom of
Jack-Watson has heen a chiel
source oi every victory Glilltlcil
has Won during the last eight t ears
And VVA'tsun has been lost. it

hell's trainer has made continual
sacriﬁce that he might remain
here, and that he has made the
work ol Strvlllg Iowa College a
labor of true love. The esteem in
which he is held by tho<c who
