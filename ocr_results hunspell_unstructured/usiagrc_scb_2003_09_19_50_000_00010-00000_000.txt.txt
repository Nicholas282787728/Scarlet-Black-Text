now feature a printer using 100 percent recycled paper.

needed to print to dorm printers and access storageserver via NT
networking) is still not functioning.

Tuesday Dorm UCs are available from a pm. . midnight and on
Monday and Wednesday from 12:00 p.m, - 4:00 pm. and will

A tough cell

Grinnellians have a love-hate relationship with cell phones. Once widely understood
as prohibited, the phones‘ presence on campus grows stronger with each new class,
HoWever, phonerowning ﬁrst-years quickly acclimate to Grinnell cell~phone etiquette.

by Carly Schuna

Cell phones, onee viewed as an unspoken taboo by the
Grinnell student body. have recently come into fashion with
a vengeance. cell phone users noiv seem to be as eornrnon
as squirrels, scattered around on beaches throughout cam»
pus, where it is easier [0 get service.

The noticeable rise or frequent cell phone use on cam.
pus seems to center partieulsrly around the ﬁrstryears, who
have a variety oftcasons tor owning phones.
“I have a cell to make long distance calls
back home," said Rachel Osborn: ’07, “and
on occasion, [to] talk to friend: who live at
home a: well."

”I have a cellphone so [hilt I don’t have
to walk hack to my room, and have access
to a phone all the time," expinlned Gershon
Valle: '07. “It’s useful because it's portable
and very convenient“

Another beneﬁt ofcell phones is the tree
long distance which many calling plans oh
fer. “It's a lot cheaper than phone cards,”
said Osborne.

Jenny Weber ’07 agreed. “I use my cell
phone all the friggin' time," she said “The
long distance is free and that's why 1 got it,
for the express purpose orusing it here,"

“The plan I have doesn‘t charge extra for long distance,
.uld it's Free .1! night and on weekends," said Rachel Mlller
‘06. “So even though i hsve to pay every month. i think
it's still icsxrcxpcnslve than using a long distance plan or
phone cards here."

”[Cell phones] punc-
ture the Grinnell
bubble with a vis—
ible, and sometimes
audible, intrusion
from the outside

—Rachel Miller ’06

Though cell phone users derend their phones, sometimes
viciously, they can still see where some some Grinnellians'
negative views or the phones come from. “I think
Grinnellians have enough ofhonac and don't really want to
deal with family too much," offered valles. “Since they are
ln Grinnell, they seem to be more interested in chatting
With their fellow Grinnclhans."

“I really like that there aren't many people with cells

walking around earnpus," said Shoshana
zakcna '07. "it helps create a more natu
ml and eonnected campus atmosphere.”

Miller proiected a similar viewpoint
on the student body. “I think, [there's
a] group who see cell phones at Grinnell
as 2 problem heeause [they] puncture the
Grinnell bubble With 2 visible, and some
times audible, intrusion from the outside
world,"

She tvent on to offer a pieee or cell
phone advice- “Always keep your phone
on vibrate. One tiinc my phone lvihtatcdl
during dinner in Quad. I did answer and
talk to. a few minutes, [but] I won’t ever
