COURTESY SOA WATCH

College extends library assistant’s leave of absence till August

av DAVlo MONTGOMERY

Writing to her husband Jay, Grinnell library as-
sistant Christine “Chris" Gaunt had good news—she
had just been given a hill-time job. Gaunt, incarceratr
ed in Pekin Federal Prison Camp for Women, would
perform menial labor for $.28 per hour.

Jay Gaunt received another lettcr about his wife’s
employment ycstcrdaywirh even better ncws.Grinncl.l
College had decided to extend Chris Gaunt's leave of
absence until the beginning of the fall 2006 semester.
The initial leave she had bcen granted ran out on Apr.
13, 35 days betorc she would be released from prison,
timing that would have resulted in the loss ofher job.

Chris Gaunt had been arrested on Nov. 20, 2005,
at a massive protest against the Western Hemisphere
Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly known
as the School of the Americas (SOA). Along with 40
other protestors, Gaunt had crossed a fence leading
onto military property, and had been promptly arrest—
ed. Gaunt pled guilty to trespass and was sentenced to
six months in jail and a $2000 fine.

Her time in prison would be split among three
institutions, beginning with the overcrowded Musco-
gee county Jail in Georgia. After a stop in the Fed
eral Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Okla, Gaunt
was taken to the Pekin camp, from
which Gaunt spoke with the S651?
by phone.

After being sentenced, Gaunt
was sent to the Muscogee jail un-
til she could be moved to a federal
prison. “It has a well-deserved rep-
utation for being a hellholc," said
Gaunt. She had been imprisoned
there before, for 90 days after cross-
ing the SOA fence at a 2002 protest.
“I knew that going in] chose to start my time right
away."

It took more than seven weeks for Gaunt to be
moved from the Georgia prison to the Pekin camp,
where she would spend the majority ofher sentence.
Her trip to Pekin took her through several stops, cul»
minating in a plane ride to Terre I-Iautc, Ind. Gaunt
and approximately 15 other female prisoners were
placed on a plane with over 100 male prisoners and

going in.”

15,20 marshals. She was placed on a bus for Pekin,
ILL, located three hours south orChicago.

Gaunt has continued her civil disobedience against
the SOA because she ﬁrmly be-
lieves the school is behind waves
of torture in Latin America.
According to SOA Watch, the
group that organizes the annual
protests at the school, “hundreds
of thousands of Latin Americans
have been tortured, raped, assase
sinated, ‘disappeared,’ massacred
and forced into retirge" by SOA-
trained soldiers.

“My eighteyear involvement in the SOA is my real
introduction to grassroots nonviolence," said Gaunt,
who has also protested against the Iraq war. “I want
to change the US. foreign policy as it applies to Latin
America, and end the Us occupation ofIraq,"

When she was jailed in 2002, Gaunt received a
90—day leave from her job as a weekend library assis»

Iowa’s new
immigration

5v SARAH Man

Situated in the landlocked heart‘ of America,
Iowa may seem immune to the inﬂux of undocu-
mented workels in border states. But this week a
panel, three documentaries, a debate and a student
acrivtsrn workshop suggest that Iowa may be the next
battleground in illegal immigration.

One of the main presenters during the sympo-
sium was Arizona representative Kyrsten Sinema
(D-Phoenix). Despite millions of dollars of fed
eral funding being poured into border security, her
state has experienced an increasing number of un-
documented workers. According to Sinema, this has
caused a strong anti-immigrant backlash in Arizona.
“Do I think this is going to happen to the whole
country? Yes, 1 do."

Symposium organizer Luis Fernandez, Sociol-
ogy is afraid the nation may become more hostile to
immigrants. “Things are looking kind of dark right
now, I'm hoping, at the very least, that the anti-im-
migrant feelings [and] fervor that exist in Arizona
does not come to Iowa,”he said.

Iowa is changing as a result of Latino immigrar
tion. "Twentyrthousand Hispanics [are] now living
in Iowa as students, as students enrolled in public
schools,” said Danny Carroll (R-Grinnell). “The law
of supply and demand being what it is, people are
willing to come here and work, so it’s more ofa chal—
lenge now than it was [10 years ago].”

Anna Murphey '07 was one of several students
who helped organize the symposium. “We don't
nccd to have a crisis before we can get together and
address an issue," she said. “Ultimately, we should
look at the us. toreign policy and examine the root
causes underlying economic inequality that are causr
ing so many hundreds of people to have to emigrate
to the US."

Iowa is less likely than many other states to expe-
rience widespread alitirimmigrant hostility because
its natiVErborn population is decreasing. “We need
workers and we need people here to have kids for this
state to grow," said Fernandez.

Carroll believes that the Dream Act, which would
allow “n,
documented
immigrants
with an Iowa
high school
diploma to
attend Iowa
universitic
as Iowa resi
dents, is the most helpful piece of legislation currentr
ly being debated. “They’re Iowans, they’ve been here

' for several years, they’re going to go to school here,

let's get them a college education and help them be
productive taxpayers.”

The most highly anticipated event of the sym—
posium was a Tuesday afternoon debate between
Mark Grey, director of the Iowa Center for Immir
grant Leadership and lnregrarion at the University
ofNorthern Iowa, and Chris Simcox, founder of the
Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, a new group that
arranges civilian patrols of the U.s.—Mexican border.

“The organizers have been criticized by some
people for bringing someone who they perceive as
a racist to campus,” said Murphey, “but whether we
agree with the ideology or tactics of the Minutemen,
they arc a grassroots organization that is having a
documented cffect on national policy."

“We're bringing a very vocal bigot to campus
to tell us iLll about how he doesn’t like immigrants,"
said Indira Vazquez ’07. Vazquez and her parents left
