In a rare rejection ora proposed SGA resolution. SGA
joint Board voted 145 last week not to pass at resolution that
would have given err-campus students a fourth SGA scnator.

soA's Reform Committee proposed, “The Resolution
Concerning the Addition of a fourth Senator to OCCO/
OCNCO." They were charged by a joint board resolution last
full to consider how offecampus students are represented, nee
cording to the Joint Board minntcs rrom last week.

currently there is one main problem with otrreampus reps
l‘cscntﬂnon, According to SGA President Harry Krejsa '10.
The ratio orstudenrs to senators tor the off campus cluster is
signiﬁcantly higher than any other cluster, according to statis-
tits compiled by Retorm committee

The rule dictates that of the three ot‘ticampus senators, at
least one must live in each collcgcrowncd housing and none
college owned housing Last fall, the three candidates with the
most‘ votes all lived in non-college owned housing, according
to Krejsa In accordance with the rule, only two of them could
be senators. Krejsa suggested that this may have inspired the
talk about reforming offrcampus representation.

According to Liting Cong '11, a senator from offrcampus
who sits on Reform Committee and VPAA Elect, the Reform
Committee tocnsed on underercprcscnmtion.

“The basic point is to get the numbers rtght,"Cong said

Alex White '12, a senator from East Campus who also sits
on the Reform Committee, further explained their reasoning,

“It didn't directly address the other problem ofthe distincr
non between collegerowned and non~college-owned," White
said. “We thought that it went a lot better this semester her
cause electron board made it really clear... someone from both
has to be seated."

Joint Board decided that the solution in its current state did
not do enough to address both problems, according to Krejsa.

“People didn’t want to say, ‘No, this isn’t a problem worth

SGA rejects proposed senatorship resolution FTP proposes new

fixing.'" Krejsit said, “But they did say, 'We don't think this will
solve the problems."’

SGA Administrative Coordinator (AC) Ethan Struby '10
voted against the resolution.

“Even ifthere is a problem I dont know what i good solu-
tion is, Struby said [in norsure that adding a senator is really
going to help anything. ‘

In his role as AC, Stttiby worked with Reform Committee
to craft the resolution as charged by Joint Board However, he
personally does not support a change.

“I'm not in favor oicombinmg the tlusters...berause I think
they have distinct enough interests that they deserve at least
one senator," Struby said. “It’s not a cultural thing. .one is di-
rectly under thcjurisdiction of Residence Life,"

Another concern with the proposal is that it would rep-
resent study abroad students as much as on-campus students.
which some students .irc against. according to l<rcisa But he
does not see clumping students abroad with offecampus senar
tors as a problem

“yThe 're only gone for a semester, they re going to come
back," Krcjsa said There are actions that Joint Board takes
that will affect them afret that one semester

Some students stay involved regardless while they are ort-
earnpus, according to Cong,

“I just got an email from a student who is currently study-
ing in Germany; asking me about the printing issue," Cong
said.

Reform Committee and Joint Board do not have enough
time to approve a new resolution this year, according to White
and Stntby. However, this Reform Committee will write a list
a ideas that next semester’s can work with, according to struby.

White predicts that based on the discussion in Iotnt Board,
that ncxt year’s proposal might combine off'campus housing
completely and add a tourth senator.

sustainability
coordinator

Bv SOLOMON MILLER

Free the Planet (FTP), a campus group that promotes
environmental awareness. is calling for the creation ofan or
rice or sustainabiliry, with a Sustainability Coordinator who
would oversee environmental efforts at Grinncll.

“Vi/e want someone who cén both teach classes [about
environmentalism] and oversee a lot of the different roups
on campus, said kayla Koethcr 12 co leader of P and
the FTP campus Policysub- gionp overseeing the proposal.

A Sustainability Coordinator could assist strident and
administration conservation projects, teach classes about en,
vironinentalism and oversee student Workers and other staff
members working to make other departments more environs
mentally friendly. ,

Over 35 students, faculty and staff attended the forum,
many of whom already went with sustainability efforts on
campus

“Now' is the time to be thinking about these things," said
Chris Bait, Facilities Management (FM)’s Environmental
and Safety Coordinator. “I think were doing a lot of very
neat things...[but] we’re not really moving fonmrd as a uni-
fied effort."

Bair currently oversees many conservation projects on
campus He works with FM, other administrators and sru~
dent roups such as the Student Environmental Committee

_(SEC and Eco— House

l-‘TP wants a sustainability coordinator in addition to
Bairs position, with a greater role on cam us, according to
Eliza Murine ’12, a FTP member and campus policy
sub- -gmup coordinator along with Koether According to
Murine, one important role would be to “provide leadership
for strident projects when student leadership isn’t as strong.
Such a position would also create a form of institutional
memory for student groups, according to Mutino,

In fact, the FTP Campus Policy sub-group started the
year working to bring local foods into the dining hall.

“When we were doing local foods work, [we found that]
tour to ﬁve years ago, students had done tons ofsurveys, and
[calculated] the cost, and assessments of what local foods
would do for the College, Koethcr said

Dining Services could not accommodate FTP's ambi»
tious goals.

"I think that they [dining services] could be doing a lot
more with local foods," Koerher said.

According to Assistant Director ofDinil-ig services Terry
Waltersdorf, Dining services does all they can to buy locally,
and that there arent ”enough fin-triers selling food to Grinnell
to meet the demand

“Theres a lot oflittle growers that they want to sell at
farmers markets and they want the interaction with the
people," waitersdorr said. “We don't need the interaction so
much as we need the food."

Waltersdort was‘at yesterday's forum. He said Dining
service works to be environmentally friendly in other ways
as well, such as composting kitchen and table waste and re-
cycling eccee materials, and that he will happily work with a
Sustainability Coordinator if such a position is created.

Mutino hopes that a Sustainability Coordinator could
help Dining Services ﬁnd more farmers walling to farm for
Grinnell.

“A lot of schools that had success with local foods in their
dining halls also had sustainability coordinators," Murine
said.

However, the process of hiring a SustainabilityvCoordi-
naror might come across problems of its own. According to
Bair, it will be hard to create a new ofﬁce, especially given the
Colle es ﬁnancial situation.

he ideal scenario would be to have a big ofﬁce with a
decent budget and several students, Bairl said. “I don"t imag-
ine that’s going to happen anytime soon.‘

Bait proposed ﬁrst creating a less ambitious Ofﬁce of
Sustainability. He could work with faculty and studentwork—
ers to accomplish many of rhe same goals without creating as
much new hierarchy.

“As I look at other sustainability coordinators [like Mae
calaster Colleges], 1 think her position- is. .halfwhat i do and
half academics, Bait said

Koether hopes the entire campus will embrace a new
dedication to sustainability

”It shouldn't just be the environmental groups that are
thinking about envimnmcntalism,"Koet.her said.

According to Koerher and Mutino, FTP will present
their suggestions to the trustees when they visit campus next
week.
