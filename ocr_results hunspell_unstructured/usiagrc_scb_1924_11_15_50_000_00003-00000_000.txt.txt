We’ll tell the world that. mn- lines will be busy this
evening and we hope that all the news we have to tell will

be good news.

And'they are going to blow a
few breezes up on Word Field
today in the presence of the
biggest Home Coming crowd
Grinnell ever saw.

But all the some nobody around

We’ll all stand up and let the
Cyclones blow and if they blow

HOMECOMING

The students of Grinnell join the town in welcoming
the old grads, the (lads and mothers, the friends and sweet-
hearts, and the innocent bystanders who will be attracted to
Grinnell by the Ames~Grinnell football game today. We
welcome the visitors from Amos, and their football team; we
extend them our hospitality, but we Warn them that We expect
to go the limit in keeping the Scarlet and Black, next to the
Red, White, and Blue, at the top of the ilagstaff.

This will be even a. more crucial game for Ames than for
Grinnell. Amos is Well on the way to a Missouri Valley cham-
pionshjp. They have two games yet to play—Grinnell and
Drake. It is a foregone conclusion that AmeS will defeat
Drake. If—and wheniAmes defeats Grinnell, Amos will hav
the Valley championship for 1924. .

Five thousand rooters will he the background of a Pioneer
victory today. Two-thirds of them will be citizens of Guin-
nell and of Poweshiek county. Grinnell has the best team in
ﬁve years, at least. Mike Kyland and Charley Black have them
tuned up to the highest pitch of effort and determination. It

Welcome Amesl

Yes, we’ll be glad to see you and will entertain you to
the best of our ability. We’ll try to send you home with a

headache that you won’t get over for a couple of weeks.

But if we don’t, why, it’s all right. We’ll try, anyhow,

and let the best team win.
