10/10

from ’p. 1
tration to fix the problems,’
Finkelstein said, “We proposed better coin—
munieation between 10/10 organizers and
the SA’s of the floor[s] whose lounges we
use.We encouiaged better party preparation,
and for SAs to tell their hall mates to be on
rhe look out for people who don't belong on
those floors."

While SGA is in its “brainstorming
phase," said SGA President Harry Kresja
’10, there is a general plan to educate and
make aware to the Grinnell student body
safety guidelines for 10/10.

“SGA will be working with 10/10 01’ng
nizers for next year to put together and presr
em a guide to students, so that 10/10 can be
more smooth in the future," Kresjii said,

“VVe'ie addressing these issues in a very
Grinnellian type ofway,” said Dean ofStu-
dents Travis Greene. “We’re communicating
with the larger Grinnell community by dis-
cussing whar we can do to avoid these issues
in the future"

Selfrgovcrnance was a key topic of dis
cuss-ion at the meetings regarding the frenr
zietl 10/10 activity.

“It was clear to me and others that
seltsgovetnance did not play out the way
it should have on Saturday night," Greene
said.

Though it has taken some timeffortus
nately some students have recently claimed
responsibility for damages and fines.

“some people have already come forward
to accept responsibility for damage and fees.
However the 10/10 organizers have hefty
fines still attributed to them," Greene said.
“We are hoping more people will continue
to step up and accept responsibility for dams
ages they did incur."

Unclaimed campus damages will ulti-
mately be' at the cost ofthe event organizers,
as stated in alcohol and lounge contracts.

Greene hopes that 10/10 will be re
stored to the unifying celebration it always
has been. “The message for next year is to
have some fun and build some community,"
Greene said. “But let’s not do it at the cost of
respect and trustworthiness and other com-
ponents orseltrgovernance."

After attending a secondary educations
al institution for a number of years, many
graduates seek opportunities to continue
their education through othei means.

Since its inception in 1968, Grinnell
has been a participating institution in the
Thomas]. \Matson Fellowship. The VVJISDH
Fcllowship works to-fund a student’s discis
plincd year to travel abroad and explore a
particular ilttercs(,Tilosc chosen for the fels
lowship program are given $25,000 to visit
a country in which they have neither lived
nor studied for a signifi-
cant amount oftime.

“There are some
awards that if students
want to apply, they can't
just apply on their own,"
said Director of Social
Commitment Doug
Cutchins. “The college
has to put their stamp
or approval on rhc stur
dent."

For the past 11 years,
Cutehins has been acting as the College’s
liaison for the Watson fellowship.

1n ordei to be nominated for the pro—
gram, the individual mllst be a graduating
senior at a participating institution in the
nation. According to the Watson website,
the fellowship seeks seniors who exhibit
qualities such as leadership, resourcefulr
ness, vision, independence and integrity
Applicants must endure three rounds of
personal interviews along with the submis-
sion ofa 1,500 word project proposal and
a 1,500 word personal statement Once the
applicants have submitted these and inter
viewed, a committee of six faculty members
reviews their interviews and decides upon
four nominees. This year, 17 students from
Grinnell applied for the Watson fellowship
this year, and tour nominees were chosen—
Asia Sample '10, Latona Giwa '095, Becca

and Japan, Sainple,who has been published in
both the S88 and Th Sequence, plans to go
abroad and work with other temalc graphic
artists to understand how they face being a
woman in the male‘domiltatcd industry, along
with documenting their and her experiences

"Since a really young age. he always been
drawing," Sample said. “I was very interested
in comic d graphics when I was in middle
schooll always dreamed of being a graphic
novel artist since I was twelve years old.”

0n the other end of the artistic spectrum
is Giwa‘s proposal to study Senegalese danc-
ing communities around
the world. As the daughter
ofan undocumcntcd Nigcr
rian immigrant, Giwa’s ins
terest came from her fam»
ily background.

“In the end, it’s not re—
ally about dance, it’s about
community proccsscs and
migration and the ways
that communities are
formed and maintained
g and policed," Giwa said.
"I’m also interested in the power and control
and who’s allowed to teach dance and who's
allowed to learn and who gets to say ‘whose
dance is whose.”

Following the Senegalese immigration
route from Senegal to Argentina to Spain,
Giwa hopes to take dance lessons, attend
dance festivals and observe family gatherings
and night clubs.

Bernstein hopes to tackle the issue of sex-
ual health education by studying sexual health
peer educarion by working with formalized
peer education efforts in second and third
world countries Planning to study in Ethior
pia, South Africa, India and the Netherlands,
Bernstein wants to embed herself in the daily
conversations of communities there to better
understand howjnformation is spread.

"I'm versing myself in the cultures in see»
ing ways in which sexual health information
and misinformation is spreadispeciﬁcally
amongst adolescents, teenagers and college

students," Bernstein said. “That way I’ll be
ablc to see how the informal spread of sec
ual health information contradicts the fore
malized efforts and see what the effects ar ,“

Bernstein's interest in sexual health ins
formation has recently manifested itself in
Bernstein’s implementation of the Sexual
Health Infoimation Center which opened
just this month. ,

Tsakiiis titled his proposed pioject “Na
Island is an Island" and wishes to study in
the Bahamas,Maldives, New Zealand, Swtr
den,lceland and the UK in order to observe
potential economic independence in islands
and find a holistic, sustainable solution for
the island crisis.

“Islands are actually dying," Tsakirls
said. “The Mediterranean will be the first to
be hit by global warming."

Tsilkjl'ls hopes to better understand
the driving forces behind the potential for
economic and technological sustainability
in island communities, He will accomplish
this by working in a geothermal production
company in Iceland, working with fisherr
men in other islands, engaging in the Swed—
ish municipal system, as well as volunteering
for a non—proﬁt activist organization which
spreads the message of global warming in
Maldives.

With usually only one or two Grinnell
nominees selected as fellows, Cutehins eXr
pects the nominees who do not receive a
grant take away more from this experience
than disappointment. .

“It’s got to be about the process. This is a
phenomenal opportunity for students, at the
beginning of their senior year, to sit down
and rake a very hard, long look at ‘Who am
I? What matters to me? What do I Want to
do after graduation?’," Cutchins said. “My
concern is that students at the end of this
process have a better idea of who they are,
what matters to them in life and what they
want to do after graduation. If they happen
to win the Watson, terriﬁc. But that's a be-
nus to me."
