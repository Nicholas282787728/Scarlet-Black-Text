Even so, he seemed to enjoy erackingjokes
and getting the little applause that he did. He
also must be doing something right, as he is
first in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire,
although he is third nationally, behind Rudy
Giuliani and Fred Thompson. He did not at
tack his Republican opponents, except for a
joke at the expense of Thompson's wife, but
did criticize the Democratic frontrunners by
nameThe only break from party lines was in
reference to the increase in domestic spends
ing under the Bush administration. Romney
stated that “when Republicans act like Demos
erats, America loses." The crowd clapped in
agreement.

It was apparent that the campaign trail is
taking a lot out of Romney. The event lacked
the passion ofa typical political rally,but it also
did not claim to be anymore than an opportu-
nity to “Ask Mitt Anything."1f Romney wants
to continue his political run, he will have to
bring more than just jokes and talking points
to his constituents.

said. “But students aren’t going to hear about it
because those candidates don’t come to [camr
pus.]”

All prominent political figures in both the
college and the county agree that the differ-
ences between Republicans and Democrats,
the students and the townspeople, are recon—
cilable. “Grinnell [college students] are liberal
and activist," said Bates, “But they'll be willing
to listen to peopleThey're openrminded."

When I showed up unannounced at san-
dra and Bob Falck’s house, the woman who
met me took my coat and pointed me in the
direction ofa table laden with snacks.

The Falcks were happy to seem because
they had opened their house to the world, or as
much ofit lived around Grinnell and was Culi'
ous in the presidential campaign ofSen. Chris
Dodd (DrConnv). Dodd, betting heavily on
the Iowa caucuses, has even moved his family
temporarily to Des Moines.

As part of the big Iowa push that Dodd‘s
new residency symbolizes, the Falcks hosted
Dodd supporter Rep. Anna Eshoo (D calit)

Eshoo herselfshowed up relatively on time,
joining a small group oflO in the Falck’s living
room. (This number included the Falcks and
several campaign workers and volunteers.)

I helped myself to snacks and idly chatted
up several of the attendees. Eshoo asked me
about the college until we were both distracted
by a squirrel in the baek yard. Eventually, ev-
eryone settled down to watch a campaign vid—
eo singing Dodd's praises. After Eshoo spoke,
shc encouraged the attendees to ask whatever
questions they liked.

that inspircd real eonversation- was how Dodd

could “turn the tide" away from leading can-
didates who “many of us don't really want, to
a Chris Dodd."

“There‘s not a vote that's been cast yet,"
Eshoo replied, casting doubt on national polls
and praising Dodd’s SOrSEIOng lowa organiza-
tion. After only a few minutes, things petered
out and the house party dispersed.

Attendance may have been small, but E5,
hoo had nothing but praise for house parr' s.
“From the earliest history of our country, thi s

Fired up and ready to go for Obama

5&8 writer and Obama supporter Paul Carlson ’11 tells about his visit to the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson dinner on Nov. 10.

We’d been crammed into the hard plastic seats of the Hyr
Vee Hall since 6:30,Waiting to hear Barack Obama speakThe
program had started 20 minutes late, and by the time 11 pm.
had rolled along, that delay had grown to 90. on top ofus be-
ing there an hour and a hairlate, we’d
been in Des Moines since 2, having
attended the prerrally.

We’d watched the other candi-
dates patiently. The drawing of lots
had fated Barack to speak last, after
five other candidates speeches, an
auction, and speeches by the head ofthe state Democratic Par-
ty, the governor, lieutenant governor and every other Joe schmo
oi the Iowa Democrats. We'd listened to Edwards, Dodd and
Richardson.The hot dogs that we’d wolfed down after the pres
rally had long since stopped ﬁlling our stomachs, and the cone
cession stand was ﬁlled with the yellow shirts of Hillary and
Dodd and the white shirts of Edmrds, preventing us in the red
shirts from getting any food. we sat through Biden's ZO-minute
monologuc.Then we hunkered down for the last two speakers.

Most of the supporters of the other candidates were already
gone. Within 10 minutes ofthe end of his speech, both ofthe
sections of the auditorium occupied by Dodd's supporters had
emptied. Every once in a while the orange chairs in the tour
sections scattered throughout the auditorium were punctuated

with a white Edwards shirt. By the time 11 came only the yel-
low of Clinton and Obama reds remained.

We sat through her speech, politely chipping at her suggest
lions and sound bytes. We stiﬂed laughter when her eight seer
tioiis of supporters answered that the
correct method or dealing with Re-
publican opposition on global warme
ing was to “Turn Up the Heat!"

Finally the moment arrived. rue
though I had shaken hands with Mr-
chelle Obama and had seen Barack
speak at the pre- rally, seeing him again six hours later was as
exciting as though ld never seen him before in my life The 13
sections of the auditorium packed solid with a phalanx of red
exploded as he walked down the aisle to the platrorm to speak.
After four hours of sitting in small, uncomfortable seats witlr
out food, listening to every Tom,
Dick and Harry that Iowa could
throw at us, we ﬁnally got to hear
the man that we’d came to see.

The highlight of the entire
experience was that 15 minutes.

myself in the deep intricacies of Iowa polities, surrounded by
political junkies like me. It had been an incredibly productive
Saturday.
