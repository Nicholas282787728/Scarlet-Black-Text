INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CLUB

One of the most impoitant student organi-
zations on our campus is the Intelliational
Relations club. For eight years this gloup
has conducted all annual convention known
as the Glillnell Student Conference‘on Ill-
ternational Relations. Several hundred d01<
lars are spent at each conference to provide
authoritative speakers, and students from
many mid-Western colleges and universities
come here as delegates. The infusion of
ideas from students of other institutions is
one of the interesting sidesligllts of the coil1
ference.

The purpose of this International Rela-
tions club is, of course, selfveducatioll ill
world affalls. Mere learning, however, is
not its out o aim, It constantly seeks to
discover, in addition to knowledge of the
World situation, methods of solving present
and future problems.

The annual conference, therefore, is not
its only function, Every other Sunday aft—
ernoon, it meets ill the YWCA room to dis—
cuss pertinent subjects. These meetings are
open to everyone,

Next Sunday Ou'en Lattimorc will be
present to talk with the group. That is a

. good time for ally interested person to be-
gin attending the meetings. Any one may

feel assured that he will be welcome, and
that he will have an opportunity to learn
more about, and to discuss, the affairs of
the world ill which he lives.

GRINNELL ANTI—HE m

An editorial in the New York Times of Feb.
5, entitled Federal Aid Students comes to
this conclusion: “It is said that college and
university presidents and cleans have gen-
erally, if not unanimously approved the
plan, (of government help for students
through the N.Y.A.) But it is to be hoped
that they will not come to" depend too much
upon this assistance and make relief the de-
termining factor in the selection of the bell»
eficinries.

Moreover, there is the peril of increased
centralized control, which is always to bc
guarded against.” This editorial referred to
the work of the National Youth administra—
tion in a general way. It is of interest to
Grinnellialls to See how these generalized
conclusions of the Times can be applied to
this college in particular.

Grinncll depends upon the financial as-
sistance of the N.Y.A. to a fairly large ex—
tent—to the extent of $1,080 a month to be
exact. This means that about ’75 or 80‘stu-
dents, or roughly one tenth of the student
body. are on the N.Y.A, payroll. These stu-
dents nlzly receive up to $20 per month, 211‘
thollgh the average pay is about $13. To
earn this money, the students are employed
on various constructive jobs, which must
not interfere with the college’s own work
program,

They have compiled all kinds of statistics,
put through a vocational testing and inter-
viewing program for freshmen,
the drama properties, developed and super»
vised a library in the quadrangle, and have
worked on many other projects too llumer
on: to mention here.

The N.Y.A. has made itself a necessary
thing and is here to Stay, at least until some
measure of prosperity returns to this collnr
try.

The Times thinks scholarships and not re
lief should determine who is to benefit by
N.Y.A. grants. Here at Grinnell, need is
the first requisite for all N.Y.A. job, but
scholarship and character are taken into
account This is as it should be ill a teln-
pol-'aly, emelgency program, but if the g0\-
cinment is ev'ci to establish a peimallcnt
folm of student aid. {no/Iris and climactcl,
ldtlicl than (101mm [fl/it nerd, ought to foim
the basis fol the selection of thc students
to be helped.

As a temporary agency the N.Y.A, as we
see it at Gi-innell, is fulfilling its purpose.
If the government ever intends to make the
N.Y.A., or any other form of student aid,
permanently a part of its policy, scholar-
ship should play the largest part in the
selection ofnthe students to be helped.

Lattimore Finds Japanese Nation
Caught in Vicious Trade Circle

By Gordon McCarty.
Tracing the forces on Japan's
part leading up to the present
war between Japan and China,
Owen Lattlmore presented his
second lecture on the far east on
the international relations series
in Herrick chapel last night.

The wave of nationalism and
lack of resources, and over pupil»
lation were the forces, according
to Lattimore. These forces origi-
nated at the same time Japan be-
came westernized. Japan only
partially took on western ideals,
the rest of her remaining oriental.

This is where the trouble he.

gan. Lattimol-e said, But it'wasn't'

until the turn of the century that
the two different ways stopped
being parallel and diverged thul.
it really became evident,

Lattimore told how the Japan-
ese people are kept in a contine
ual low standard of living, and
how they do not have enough
money to buy things that their
factories manufacture.

The manufactured products of
Japan are sold to foreign (Duns
tries and the money received is
used for raw materials to make
more products to sell to foreign
countriesia vicious circle.

The rural population of Japan
is taught that it is their duty to
the empire to have a gicat many
children and to give all they can
to the empire. This iS explained
as a sort of investment to help m
creating an empire Then every-
thing will be fine and all probr
lems will be obliterated,

This is not the way it has
worked out. After Japan con—
quercd Manchuriu the probiems
went on just as before, because
the empire couldn't give the Cili-
nese a higher standard of living
than the Japanese so they have
to keep it lower. This has Just
served to perpetuate the problem.

Japan has an economy similar
to Denmark and Sweden, but at
tempts to keep up its armaments
to the same extent as Great Brits
ain, France, and the other “big
boys"

Until anau realizes the futility
of this the situation will not he
changed, Lsttimore said,

Pope’s Death
Loss to Cause

Of Democracy

——By RuE.M.

Friday, Feb. 10, Pope Pius x1
came to the end of a life which
he had devoted to the service of
humanity, His death Came as a
great sorrow. not only to catho-
lics but to the whole world; and at
the same time it called to the
minds of all of us who are'still
sane the principle to which he
devoted his life.

Plus Xx died realizing that
there was still much to be done
to make th world “right." He
did. however, r define the prin-
ciple upon which western ci
nation is based, the principle
which the dictators are trying to
get along without. He directed
nil his influence toward up-
holding the fuhdumental denim
cmtic idea that since man can
choose between right and wrong
for himself, since he is an in-
vlolnble soul, he can never be
treated as just is thing, and he
can never surrender permanent
ly to brute force.

The death of the Pope meant
the stilling of one of the few

China will be given tonight at
7:30 p. m. in Herrick chapel, Suns
day at 3 p, m. he will lead an
open discussion on China at a
meeting of the International Re-
lations club,

voices in Europe which were still
holding out against the assaults
of the dictator-s, which still had
the courage to express the indigr
naticn that so many feel but
fear to voicc.

It is undoubtedly- true that
Mussolini restrained himselt
from some of his moroaxcaasive
policies because he knew the
Pope’s attitude and the inﬂur
once which the Pope wielded in
the rest of the world, His Eur
miueuce was nlso very probably
an important influence in curb-
ing further religious outrages
in Germany, not only against
the Catholics, but against the
Jews and other sects. It is also
undoubtedly true that Mussolini
will do everything in his power
to arrange for u Fascist pope
as a successor to Pius x!.
at any rate, this loss to dalnoh

cracy, along with the birthdays
of the two famous democrats
which we celebrate this month,
should serve to remind us of the
task which we in America face.
We are further reminded by the
National Conference of Chris»
tlans and Jews, which has set
aside the week of Feb, 19 to 26 as
national brotherhood week, to cum
phasize the need, in times like
these, for a feeling of sincere
goodwill between men or all
crecds and nations.

The disappearance of one
more restraining influence in
Europe will make the job of
counteracting the dictators that
much more difficult for those of
us who are left. lWe must fer
new our faith in the principles
of democracy and freedom of all
kinds. the principles for which
it's. ington and Lincoln in their
days, and Pins x1 in our day,
lime stood.
