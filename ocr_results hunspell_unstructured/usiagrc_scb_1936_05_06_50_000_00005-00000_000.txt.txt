Cribbing Society :
ENew Organization
of Ohio Students

Columbus, Ohio — (ACP)7The ,
hand that never rocked a cradle
may nevertheless be an old hand(
at a crib.

Not to be out done in thc mad
race of American undergraduates
to organize, Ohio state students
have formed the University So:
ciety for the Promulgation of
Cribliing (unrecognized, so far, by
the Dean’s Committee of Student
Affairs) and their researches have
brought to light many esoteric
and devious ways of confounding
the unwary proctor.

The commoner methods, such
as cuff-writing, are frowned upon
by the USPC, which is interested
rather in investigation like that
done by a NYU researcher who
discovered that crib notes could
be written with grapefruit juice
on glasses or watch-dials.
Another favored method is
known as “the scroll," The des
pairing student makes his notes
on a long strip of paper, which
he attaches to two match sticks
and rolls up into a scroll. Use of
this device, as in the case of the
co»ed's handkerchief system, calls
for some knowledge of histronics,
since a certain amount of hands
wringing is indicated while peer-
ing at the notes.

The upedal transfer" is recom—
mended in cases where a pal needs
aid. A note is prepared, and one
fool: is placed upon one's knee.
The note is then slipped into the
shoe and the whole device, leg,
foot, shoe and note, placed close
(to the drowning man, who drops
a pencil nearby and extracts the
lite-saver.

There are other ways of con-
fusing the instructor. the society
reports, c ing the case of a mem-
ber who had been annoyed by an
overly suspicious proctor. The
examination fell on the first of

and the game was there-

the words: “April Fool.”

Baffled, the instructor retreated,
and the student immediately re-

The canny proctor decided that

and came back for a second in»
spection. This time the slogan
was “Fooled Again."

But at University of Wisconsin
students did this bettér a year or
so ago. A certain instructor had
accused him of cheating through:

of the final, and retribution. The
exam was barely under way when
the suspected onc began to peek
at a slip of paper held in the
palm of his hand. Ever on the
alert, the instructor came pound-
ing down the aisle and ConfiSr
cated it.

The message was ;“ Is it true
that you were secretly married on
December 4.?"

It must have been, because the
instructor went away. very quiet-
