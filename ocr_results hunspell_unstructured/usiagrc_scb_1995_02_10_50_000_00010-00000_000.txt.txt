a non-scoring meet with

mances but highlighted a few sure
prises. 'I‘heAx400 relay unitofBryan
Rebar. Kevin Notheis, Ellis Baggs
and Shannon Robinson caught the
coach's eye with a secondrplace time
of 3:38.66,

“Itwasasigniﬁcantperfomiance
because we were lacking two of our
top sprinters and we were right on
Central's heels," Erhard said.

Rebar and Notheis also netted
secondrplace ﬁnishes in the 600 and
SOOWiIh times of1125,97 and2'04s40.

Despite beingill, JeffRoot went
13'6" to place second in the pole
vault.

This week the Pioneers will fo—
cus on speed work during training
sessions, “For us the season is still
young. That is why we'll put little
emphasis on the team outcome at
Cornell. The meat is another chance
to gel in shape and engage in compe-
tition," said Erhard,

Amanda Walker won the 200rmelcr
dash in :282 Also, in aphotovﬁnish
she placed second in the 55rmctcr
dash with a time of 27.8.

“Walker is our best sprinting
prospect in a long time, She ran an
excellent leg in the 4x400 relay and

we re excited to see what the sprinting
corps can achieve this year," Erhard
said.

Laura Gould had the best perfors
manceofthedistancerunners,placing
second in the 800 meters in 2:323
Marta Fisher ran well in the 3.000
meters, placing ns runnerrup with a
time of 12:00.8, "Marla, who was
Injured much of last season, is really
coming on strong," addcd Erhard.

Coach Erhard was pleased witli
the opening performances, He ex-
pects the team to make strides this
week because the workouts conccna
trate on speed. “This week we will
find out where we ﬁt in the south
leision. With the basketball and Sthr
ming seasons winding down, we'll
have some help from two-sport ﬂlllr
letes before conference." said Erhard.

commented Coach David
Arseneault about the Grine

ncll College men's basketball team.
This week the Pioneers host
Monmouth on Friday at 7:30. Next
Tuesday thecagers havea return date

“Because of last week‘s results
— our win against Coe and
Monmouth’s loss — we are in a bet—
ter position. It won't be easy but all
we have to do is win our ﬁnal four
games. Then we don’tneed any help
from other teams,“ Arseneault said
about his team’s chances to make the
four—teamMidwestConference play
offs,

Coe still leads the division at 3,

those teams square off at Coe on
Tuesday. Grinnell stands at 7.3 in
third place While Knoxiso—S. Cornell
ranks fifth at 2-7 and Illinois College
is 0-11. At 91 north division leader
Ripon is one win away from become
ing the tournament host.

“Cornell is better than their
record. They are playing like a 7.2
team. If we don't respect their talent
and hard work, they‘ll beat us," said
Arseneault. “It was obvious in De—
cember when Monmouth beat us that
they have a very ﬁne team, perhaps
the most talented in the division. All
this adds up to some very tough
games.“
