“U. S. Needs Discipline But Must
Preserve Free Spirit of Man”
~She States.

Miss lda M. Tarbell, hair-man of the
Press Committee, Women's Committee
of the Council of National Deierise.
gave an address in Herrick chapel last
night on the subiect, “The Fear of El»
ficiency.”

“One of the few consoling things
coming out of the horror of the war,”
she began, “is the conviction that we
are going to get a bctter world. not
war leaves a great many things behind
it to be done if we get a better world.
It does not conic automatically. It is
up to us. Are we going to be able to
make actualities out of the great ideals
for which we have foughtl

lrrcrtasc l’rtilltictitlll.

“We havc at the very beginning to
do a great anrount or material work in
order to feed and clothe the distressed
people 01' Europe and to give them ma—
terials with which to work out the ins-
terial side of their life. This overseas
problem means- a tremendous stimula-
tion of production beyond anything we
have done in this war. We must
double, must treble our production. We
have something to do for the people
inside our gates as well,7a double
problem, their, one for the world at
large and one for ourselves. it is a
most serious a'nd delicate thing but it
must of necessity be accomplished. We
can’t settle back and say the work has
been done. For us it has almost just
begun."

Going back to the industrial condi»
of the seventies liliss Tarbell told
t he iiork of Frederick Taylor and
his development of a scientiﬁc method
of factory management.

“To him it was the great business of
men and women to enlarge their pro-
duction in order that the whole world
might have all it needed."

“I don't know anything in our in»
dustrial life,” ruiss Tarbell continued,
“that has a worse name than the sole
ence of efficiency. A great controversy
has grown up about it. But why
sboiild men fear efficiency?“

opposed to Delnlwl op.

”The thing would preva however,
in spite of all these things if there
were nothing more serious in the ob—
jectloli to it. But there is another

more serious objection which, if sound, l
dooins it in any democratic country l

There is a very general feeling intens‘
ﬁed in the last few years by the know
ledge of Germany, that only autocratic
governments and institutions can be
efficient. \\‘e have called efficiency a
German institution and German instir

tntions were opposed to the spirit of a‘

democracy “

"Deiuocl‘atic countries have
brought to the test on the favorite field
of autocracy,—a military held. They
have tried it out in the last four years
and what have they got? The dcmo»
cratlc nations have beaten them at
every point. And at every point where
we have sucecded it has been the teat
of efficiency.

“are Succeeded.

“At every point where the autocratic
nations said that we democrats would
fail we have succeeded. It proves that
the idea that invention can take the
place of the soul or man is a mistake.
it provcs also that the idea that oific-
icney cannot be combined wrtlr bu-
rnanitarianisin is a mistake,

“We need all the di, ‘ linc, effort,
health, vision, and criic cncy that sale
encc can give up. And we may not
be afraid to lay our hands on the tool
and rise it to the limit provided 'wo re-
mcmbcr that the one essential thing
is to insure the tree spirit of man ior

MAKING PLANS FOR

tColleges Having Over 100 Men

With the demolii tion of the s. A

quiriiig oi the various colleges in the
country whether they would like to
{have units for training similar to the
'R 0. T. C. which was e ziblished in
llllnn)‘ colleges before the war. Circir
lat-s and letters of iililu y were roe
coived by the college on this subject.
Giimicll has taken no deﬁnite action
on the plan as yet.

The. plan is, as briefly outlined, to
give college cletlit and giic at least

tzu-y science and tactics and equine

as uniforms, rifles, etc.

A certain per cent of the men will
be commissioned upon graduation in
the Reserve Officers' Corps. The
course would require two years and
men would be sent to a

100 men iii ing to outer tlrc corps
would be eligible for such a unit.

look rather slim. Before this year, all

ing was usually over and work on the
Varsity debating teams was well under

to get up a varsity team this year be»
cause of the fact that therc has been
no chance to practice or organize
teams from which the material might
be clmsen for the varsity team.

Mason Ladd. Linn smith, Ronald
noehmler, and Earl luoser are the only
men of last year's varsity teams who
are‘ in school noiv. The Debating
Union which is at the head of the in-
tervsociety and other debating is to
have a meeting soon to elect oflicers
,and outline the activitics for the com-
ing year. It is probable that the fresh»
man debates will be held. It seems to
be the opinion of most or the men that
they will have too much work to make
‘up and will‘bc so busy with the regir
lav academic work that very little time
will be leit for debate work. The
tiresllmzm class presents much promis»
ling material, according to those who
,have been observing and hunting for
hopefuls.

“Start reporting in your borne town”
is the adiicc that i s lda ii. Tarbell
gives to girls who wish to do news»
paper work. She says she believes in
doing all inds of not paper work but
in starting with reporting. “It gives
one a ‘llosc for news and the ability
to write quickly" she said in explana-
tion.

“Women are at a disadvantage in
the newspaper world because they are
women,' she added. “I have felt it
myself." But she said that they could
do some kinds of newspaper work
very well. “There are many women
on the editorial staffs of papers, and
a large number who are running dc»
partrnents successfully.”

lliss Tarbell has herself been a
newspaper woman. She was editor of
the Chautauquan, and has been on the
editorial staff ‘of the American and
itcClurc's magazines.

She is now Chairman of the Press
Colilmitte of the Council of National
Defense.

next fall. Ml. Tollefson is a team-
mate of former Coaches Solern and
McAlmun, and his ability as a coach
was demonstrated by his state cham-
Dlansltil) teelm of last Year.

The coach worked tirelessly but had
only one of last season‘s varsity men
around which to build a team from a
squad of inexperienced first-year men
and the freshman team of last fall.
Military demands prevented sufficient
time for practice, so that Tollel‘son’s
men played under a big disadvantage.
However, the team put up a stiff right
all season and, by beating Drake by
a most top-heavy score. demonstrated
that they have the matcriol for the
making of a strong team.
