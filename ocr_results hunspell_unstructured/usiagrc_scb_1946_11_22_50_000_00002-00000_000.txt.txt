Lesson In Economics

Griniiell women who listen to Gadabout music
from their haven in the Quadrangle may be Sure
prised ‘ to know that there is an overabun-
dance of men on campus this year. Wartime short—
ages have vanished completely. In fact, if we stick
to smtisties. each coed is cntitled to 1.00035
men. Think of it! Not only one complete man, but
a fraction left over to swap, use, or barter, or
dangle before the outraged eyes of former Crin-
ncii women who endured the dark days of 1941-
1945 with only high school students to ogle.
But, despite statistics, something has happened to
spoil this obviously desirable leuntiml.

Perfume copywriters subtly suggest that a
man may be hogtied in a twinkling if one puts a
dash of “Passion's Playground” behind each Ca'.
Have you tried that? Soap manufacturers lint-50*
subtly suggest that men go wild over a girl who
smells slightly woodsy. Have you tried sleeping
on pine cones lately? Have you been demure,
risque. intellectual, and clinging by turns’ No
good? Shall we be absolutely frank about this
terrifying problem?

A goodly percentage of Giinncll men arc vet-
crans who receive $65.00 a month and promptly
pay $65.00 a month to the college for room and
board. It becomes a problem of simple arithemetic.
leaving a big roll of nothing for cigarettes, cokes,
and an occasional visit to Snoddy’s Snack Shack
A coke costs a nickel, but how many Grinncll
women are willing to share a straw.

Gx'innell men don't want to be gigolos, but
then again they can't afford orchids every week-
end. A candy bar can be an excuse for a picnic,
A cup of coffee can last for hours if you don’t
gulp. Don’t try to prove that you can smoke as
many cigarettes as he can. Or, better still. bring
your own. Why not prove now that two can live
as cheaply as one, right here"

Shaking alternately with chills and fever fob
lowing the flu “shots", we have decided to test
the validity of that old dictum, “If you don’t think
about it, it doesn't exist," It should be said right
now, that we aren't too hopeful. for whether or
not the flu “Shot" exists, our arm is very definitely
there, and IT knows that something very painful
and brutal has happened to IT, But, over the
frequent painful protests 0[ this unmannerly eke
tremity, we will keep our thoughts firmly glued to
another Subject, mostly, things we'd like to see
at Grinnell.

1. Later hours for women, and more liberal
regulations for the senior women. This more is
already underfoot, so let's not step on it.

2. An ice skating rink would be fine, but the
old rink is now occupied by loose dirt and this cold
spell reminds us that skatin' weather is just
around the corner. Don't let the question slip

Congratulations are due Grinllell students for
their splendid cooperation and enthusiastic pars

ticipotion in the fin innoculation program recent-

conducted the two evening sessions were quick to
voice their appreciation for the response shown
by all those who cheerfully accepted the momenr

of an epidemic during the coming winter months,

Le++ers To
The Ecli’ror

With so many girls on the cam
pus, and so many boys who should
be on the campus, some way
ought to be found to get more of
them together: in more places
inorc oftenion dates. I mean.
Attempting. with difficulty, to
keep my plan in the proper per-
spective. in spite of the effects of
my recent flu “Shot". I suggest
a tentative board, composed of
student Phi Bcta Kappas and the
Board of Religion, with Jim Snod-
dy serving as coordinator without
remuneration. to form an escort
bureau. They could share the Cy-

clone office, which would keep
them close to the scene of their
activtics. In practice. the plan
would work something like the
52.20 club uiidcr the G. I. Bill of
Rights. Every Studentihusbands
and wives cxcepted—would auto-
matically receive the benefits of
the club, just as the veterans do
when they don’t or can‘t find
work.
