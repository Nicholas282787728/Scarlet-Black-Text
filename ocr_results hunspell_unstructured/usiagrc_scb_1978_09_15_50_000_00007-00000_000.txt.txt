Division shufﬂe beneﬁts Grinnell

by Robert Meyer

Grinnell football, which hasn't
compilcd a winning record since a
672 season in 1955, appears to be a
likely candidate for this year‘s
Midwest Conference chains
pionship

One may wonder what brought
about such a change, Recruiting?
Athletic scholarships? New
coaches? Nope, the answer is the
new divisional setup which, ac
cording to Grinnell Athletic
Director John Pfitsch, “is an effort
to give all the Schools a schedule
representative of their level, and a
chance for a championship."

Some may dub Grinnell's new
“Blue Divismn" as the intellectual
division because it also includes
UniverSltv of Chicago, Carleton,
Beloit and Lake Forest. The new
Blue Division resembles the setup
used between 1972 and 1976 when
the same schools, excluding the
University of Chicago, represented
one of the two divisons of the
Midwest Conference.

In the old setup. football
prospered but budgets suffered as
a result of ever increasing tranr
sportation Costs. The Midwest
Conference schools decided to
reorganize the divisions in 1977
according to geographical location
in order to minimize travel ex-
penses.

This benefited everyone except

Grinnell may someday see the

Newman, a sophomore, founded
the Club because she wants to
continue playing. Aided by iellow

The club plays on the women's

powerhouses like Monmouth, Coe,
Cornell and Knox.

Grinnell, which has in the last 12
years compiled a 1242 record
against the above-mentioned
powerhouses, retaliated by
proposing to the Midwest Cone
ference that Grinnell once again be
matched against more equal
competition, All the teams of the
present Blue Division were in favor
of this proposal Unfortunately iive
of the six Red Division teams
opposed the idea. Ironically, the
sixth team of the division,
Lawrence, sided with the Blue
Divisio bloc and enabled the pre-
'sional setup to be tested
for two seasons, 1978 and mo. ,

The Red Divison bloc did not give
up easily, Reminding the other
schools about their ever-present
budget problems, they proposed a
return to a geographical divisional
setup in 1930. This Red Division
proposal won, andr although the
test period is not over, the present
BlueRed divisional set up has
already been rejected. The system
will return to the geographical
arrangement in 1980. \

Grinnell, which has in the last 12
years produced a 12-48 record
against the Red Division teams,
will most likely enjoy more
rewarding seasons these next two
years when it faces teams like
Beloit and Carleton, who have been
responsible for 14 of the last 25

However, to 17 bicyclists ('
cludinga 63 year old man) who had
just finished pedaling 45 miles up
and down hills on a hot Satur-
day afternoon, Pella was a
veritable ShangrirLa.

Sixteen of the 17 were Grinnell
Students, The one nonstudent was

French. a Grinnell resident, All
were participants in an overnight
hike trip last weekend, which was
Sponsored by GORP (Grinnell
Outdoor Recreation Program).

The ride, which was led by Andy
Strauss and Bryan Andreson, was
a sclfscontained trip. meaning that
there were no other vehicles ac-
companying the riders, All of the
tents, sleeping bags and other gear
were provided by GORP, and were
carried in saddlebags on the
bicycles,

The group, including many
riders with little long-distance
experience, left campus at 1:30
Saturday afternoon. Along the way
the cyclists experienced some
southern hospitalityilowa style. A
farmer who had seen lhem pass his
farm ﬁlled a cooler full of ice
water, got in his car, and brought it
to the thirsty riders.

At 5:30 that afternoon the group
finally arrived in Pella, about 45
miles southwest of Grinnell. They
proceeded to the famous Dutch
bakeries where they had dinner.

After dinner the cyclists got back
on their bikes and rode another
three or four miles to a lake where
they ‘set up tents and spent the
night. Early Sunday morning they
left Camp, arriving in Grinnell at
1-30 p,m.

Field hockey tops

Nebraska in

by Sarah Brichford

The field hockey team opened
its season with a sweet 3-2 ViC'
tory over the University of
Nebraska last Friday on Mac
Field.

Referring to the supportive fans
that turned out to watch the hard
fought contest in stiﬂing heat and
humidity, Coach Cindy Winkler
commented, “It was nice to see an
Ivy League response to an Ivy
League sport.”

Nebraska’s offense Scored first
in the opening minutes of the game
but Kim Krutilla Scored for the
Pioneers on a penalty stroke just
before halftime to tie it up,
Nebraska again scored early in
the second half and held the

Pioneers in check until the final
minutes of the game when Minje
Martinez scored for Grinnell.
However, with only a couple of
minutes remaining, the tie was
broken by Harriet Phinney, who
scored on along drive to clinch the
win for Grinnell

“It was a nice way to open the
season with a big win," Said Coach
Winkler. Grinnell made typical
early season mistakes, Winkler
‘added. “offensively we looked
Strong, but we had difficulty
getting the ball in the goal We
lsh'glld have scored twice as many
goals. That comes with more ex7
perience and improved stick
Work."

Winkler called the game an even
match. Although Nebraska is a
large university, field hockey is
only a club sport and does not
receive the full funding that a
varsity sport team does

Today and tomorrow Grinnell
plays in a quadrangular match at
the University of Wisconsin at
LaCrosse. The team will face UW
LaCrosse. UW River Falls, and
traditional rival Carleton in some
very tough competition.
