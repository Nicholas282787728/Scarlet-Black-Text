Take time to take' In a Grinnell superexperience lle Snedg

Two weeks ago I sat in the grass in front ofLoose,
surrounded by good friends, good music, good weather
and nvo prospies whom, based on my short interactions
with them, led me to believe that they were good as
well. our stomachs were filled with good eatin': organr
ic corn chips from McNally’s and burgers and veggies
that we had grilled ourselves. As I sat basking in the
warm spring air, three attractive young men jammed
on acoustic guitars and a mandolinThe sweet melody
oer. Bojangles danced in the air and mingled with
the vibes of my amazingly
good mood. I savored the
perfection of the moment,
and marked this particular
evening in my menml list of
superexperiences.

What' is a sliperexperi»
once, you ask? It is first of
all a word I invented during
a late-night discussion with a friend in which we were
attempting to name an aspect of life that had, up to
that point, been nameless,

It is second ofall u noun that is deﬁned as such:
an experience that is more super in nanire than regular
experiences. it is an mtperience that makes your tummy
swell with joy. it makes your eyes smile. It makes your
heart ﬂutter. A superexperience, in essence, is an expet
rience that makes you think to yourself, “Life is good."

The barbecue/concert in front of Loose certainly
fit this deﬁnition.

The afternoon following this tuperexperience,

Erin Sindewald ’08

someone expressed a concern about the prospies that
were present at the time. This individual felt that it
woitld be best to explain to them that that evening
was not a typical weekend night for us. She thought it
wouldn’t be fair tor the prospies to think that Grinnell
is all barbecues and acoustic rock and happy vibes,

when it was in fact the first time any of us had spent’

our Friday nights in that manner.

I thought about this concern for a moment. True,
that evening certainly wasn't indicative of one of my
more quintessential Friday
nights, ones that entail eat—
ing dinner in Cowles, doing
some reading and then go
ing to sleep early to rest up
for my track meet the fol~
lowing morning.

However, I still don't
believe that we were giving
the prospies a skewed look at Grinnell life. While that

Silidetuorld

Friday evening was not a typical occurrence, Giinnell .

for me has nonetheless been brimming with fun and
quirky happenings. There have been many other col
lege experiences thatl have deemed as super, both with
and without the presence ofprospies.

Like this one time my first year when a bunch of
students played tag in the pouring min. Clad in swim-
suits, a group of “mature" college freshmen tan, frolt
ickcd and ducksducksgoose‘d among the raindrops. We
relished in water droplets splashing against the skin’s
surface, a thousand tinyjets of ecstasy sliding down our

faces and extremities That night was super.

And the time I was held hostage on the third ﬂoor
ofARl—l by my biology homework when a friend burst
into the room, took my hand in a very Bon Jovieish
fashion and led me outside into the frigid January tem-
peratures. We then snuggled under blankets on Mac
Field with five other students and watched for shooting
starsThat night was super.

And the time 1 invented several Grinnellsinspired
superheroes (my favorite being TherOvetrPriced-Fo-
rumrFoodrAvenger, who could both replenish your
dining dollars and throw acid into the eyes of the 170,
nun worker who tried to charge you $5.45 for a veggie
wrap made With the same hummus that’s served in the
dining hall). Also super,

None of these examples have characterized one of
my “typical" Grinnell evenings. Looking back, I have
experienced each ofrhest: events only once during my
entire time as a Grinnell student. But for me, such sue
perexperiences are not about how regularly each one
happens. Often it is the freshness, the fact that an event
is not typical, that makes such an experience so memos
rable. For this'reason, 1 don't think we were setting up
the pi‘osplcs for disappointment.

still, for the sake of being completely honest, iffor
some reason the really cool ptosp‘ies that attended a
barbecue two weeks ago are reading this,1 must admit
that 1 don't spend many Fridays eating grilled onions
and romping around in the grass.

But I want to stress that Grinnell is what you make
it. And it is very possible to make it super.

Livin’ la Vida pura in Costa Rica

“Pura Vida," directly translated as
“pure Life," is a common and acceptable
answer to most questions in Costa Rica.
How are you? Would you like more cofs
fee? How’s the weather? What’s your
girlfriend like? Pura vida.

That being said, the first two weeks
of my tVVOrmonth rural stay were “pum
mierda." I was the sour baggage of a
single mothers supplementary pay-
check, and the recipient of cold stares
whenever I dared to ask for a second
helping of plantains. But, as my real
mother told me, when one door closes,
a thousand others swing open. In place
of living with supportive and nurturing
Tico host families as my peers did,I mn
away and became a roving vagabond
conservationist.

My setting: the Osa Peninsula,
Costa Rica's last tincharted frontier,
and perhaps the world’s greatest site of
biodiversity My mission: locate, map
and describe as many nests as possible
of the endangered cavity nesting bird
the scarlet macaw. Current nest count:
35. secondary mission: learn about and
stop macaw poaching for the pet trade,
as well as be a general source of public
environmental education.

Six weeks ago, I packed my satchel
with sunscreen and a straw hat and paid
50 cents for a bus headed south. Al-
though I spent some nights mummy-

wrspped in my sheet on thc beach in the
3 am. cold,l was finally able to freely
follow macaw nesting and poaching ru—
mors from pueblo to pueblo. I began to
really meet
the inhabilr

Osa Penin-
Sula.

My six
weeks of
r o m p in g
through the countryside showed me
two groups who represent the range of
the Costa Rican social spectrum.

On one end, there are the multimil-
lionaire foreigners with two story glass
houses, the internutionuﬂyrowncd hotel

tal prostitution and the cattle ranchers

There is another subculture, quite
large although easily overlooked. It
comprises the natives and foreigners livt

this the side

the ones who see me walking the streets
and wholerheartedly welcome me into
their homes. They offer me coffee,
“gallo pinto," spiced rice and beans and
a bed or hammock to sleep in.

They are also the ones who help me
find my macaw nests. Over the past
week,I have been living in a borrowed
tent on the property of the six anén
brothers and working to build a family
restaurant. Between
nights of candle-lit
snake stories and
shots of “caciqllc,”

it's quite easy to ﬁnd lasting happiness
in a snug-ﬁtting pair of shorts and a

and treethouse dwellers show me that
the first world’s system of bureaucracy,
palm-pilots and master's theses is op—
tional. It is still possible to reject these
norms and sit between the roots of a
strangler fig tree for lunch and a nap.

Unfortunately, the pura vida lifestyle
is in direct competition with some very
wealthy forces, and this places it in grave
danger. The solutions for its conservar
tion are not clear, but they need im-
mediate, active participation and vocal
opposition, not simply passive scientific
study.

As I prepare to leave for san lose,
where everything filthy and dangerous
in Costa Rica concentrates, I dream of
buying one hectare of Osa forest within
a biological rainforest corridor. 1 will
take handfuls of papaya, watermelon,
yaicca and banana seeds and hurl them
into the air. Then, 1 will spit on the
ground, because that’s all you huvc to
do to make things grow here. When I
return after my senior year, I will buy a
goat, take offmy shoes and sctdc down
to feast on the juicy crops of active con,
servation.
