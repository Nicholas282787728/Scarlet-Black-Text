and Sullivan opcrctta, will be pre-
scntcd for the second timc this
spring as a part of the commence

o'clock.

The productions are a project of
the department of drama and are
ulldei‘ thc dircction of Mrs. Sal-a
Sherman Pryor, head of the de-
partmcnt.

Duncan, author of "Marie An-
toinette," has won three firsts and
one second in the Scldcn Whit»
comb Poetry contests during his

 

 

four years here.

Margaret Currier will have the
title role in Duncan's play, a

ments in the prison cell of the

breach of promise cases in an 1390
manner.
