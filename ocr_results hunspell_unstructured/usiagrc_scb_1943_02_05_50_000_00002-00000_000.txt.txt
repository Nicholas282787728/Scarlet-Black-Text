The Grist Mill---

One of Gl‘innell’s foremost informal tradi-
tions in years past has been tlle inquisitive
'interest everyone has shown in everyone
else's business The campus was like a very
small community, with everyone interested
in the affairs of the others. As a matter of
course, everyone reported to hall brothers
and college sisters all that they had learned
on their Friday night dates. Who was seen
dancing with whom; what happened in the
White House when estranged ”steadies”
met with different dates; why men were
no longer allowed in cottage parlors during
the daytime It was natural curiosity, and
flourished as the school continued
But now we are at wart Many important
changes are occuring everyday on campus.
Students are leaving rapidly, halls are being
closed, and things are in a state of constant
tlpheaval. Naturally Grinnell’s curiosity con-
lnues.

On Monday morning a rumor started By
Monday night everyone knew what they
thought to be the facts, and everyone was
excited. It called for hasty action on the
part of the Council of House Presidents.
Once again, after news of the meetings had
leaked out, rumors began. Few of the men
in school were able to study that night.
Housemeetlngs were called, and arguments
lasted far into the night. Nothing definite
was decided, and the housemeetings led to
further rumors. There isn’t a person on
campus who isn‘t aware of the subtle
change that has taken place on the campus
almost oven-light. The true reasons for the
contemplated changes have become distorted
by retelling. Students have lost sight of the
situation, and as the main objectives are
lost, rumors continue.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

A: Halls are NOT being broken up mere-
ly for the breaking. The number of
men who have left school already has
made the future indefinite, and many
more will be going every week. It
is necessary that at least two halls
be closed, and there is a probability
by the end of the semester only one
hall will remain in addition to Read.
By that time, it will not matter one
way or another which hall it will be.
These next few months will be a
time when we will all move again and
again. Halls must be forgotten as
such until after the war: The only
loyalty that is practicable now is our
loyalty to the college itselfl

B: Ever since the forming of Grinnell
college a certain minimum require
ment has been expected of all college
students 1.5 has been the level,
though occasionally students who
have received a lower grade average
than that have been allowed to stay
under certain conditions. During war-
time tighter restrictions are neces-
sary. All reserves of the armed forces
have insisted that students enlisted
in the reserve corps must keep up
their standing. In keeping a strict
standard the college is ultimately
helping those men who remain in
school, not only where the immediate
future in the army, navy or marines
is concerned, but after the war is
over. It is the difference between a
“wartime" diploma and a “Grinnell
wartime diploma." Many colleges will
not be .quite so conscientious in keep—
ing their previous standards when
the question of student enrollment,
particularly male, is concerned. After
the war employers will take into con-
sideration such matters, and the as-
surance that Grinnell students were
not given ”wartime” diplomas will be
a deciding factolx Your parents can
certainly vouch for the inadequacy of
the last war’s college diplomas. Em-‘
ployers were unwilling at that time
to accept them because no obvious
restrictions were set. Grinnell, in
maintaining its standards, is main—
taining its own integrity at the ex-
pense of their enrollment, and in
doing so is protecting you for the
future.

Rumors and rumor-mongers must be
stamped out. The only way students can
stop this practice is to learn the real facts
before proceeding, The administration can
help by letting the student body know as
quickly as possible the truth as it takes
place.

Around
The Campus
with
CAM FUNK
The uncertain position of
student government on this

campus for next year has
been a topic of conversation

since September. It is not,»

therefore, a new problem
But it one of renewed ur-
gency, with the election of a
new student council president
only six weeks ago.

It is obvious that the coming
election cannot be held along the
lines followed in years past. The
probability of the president-elect
in service before September is too
strong. The students of this colr
lcge are faced squarely with the
problem of finding a more secure
type of student leadership. One
suggestion for such security ap-
pcars on the front page of this
Issue. and IS voiced by the present
council head. That plan is not per-
feet; but it ls a start. Suggestions
for improvements or revisions are
needed by the present student go-
vernment representatives. And
those suggestions must come from
the students themselves.

The balmy days when a half
dozen people on campus could do
the thinking for the mass are
gone. Today In) student dun-e plan
on having his life nicely arranged
by someone else, who, fortunately
or unfortunately, has been dub-
bed a “student leader." “Student
leaders" like everyone else zu-c
being directed and ordered and
moved about im- more serious
business.

So the problem of student gov.
ernment has at last come back
in the lap of every student as a
personal obligation.

Right now that personal “stake"
m the fortunes of student govern-
ment can best be expressed by
constructive suggestions about the
kind of organization you want for
the duration.

But what of the great Grllmcll

‘the feeling of not giving
a damn about anything . es-
pecially student government in
wartime. This is one time we hope
the microbes of that disease take
a vacation. Better even we should
have more measles than a recur-
rclwe of the old incl-tic.

Club Votes Yes—

Yes or No

-—Prexy Says No

Miss Blanche Lutchc, president of
Forensic, yesterday refused to de-
vulge the reasons for the vote of
disbandmcnt by the members of
the club last Wednesday night.

Miss Lumha. added that the di
bandment of the club is not offlr
cial until she has talked to Miss
Evelyn Gardner, Dean of women.

Of course student government
is a rather little thing weighed
agalnst living and dying under
wartime conditions. o.K. But al-
most any sort of civil pursuit is
secondary in wartime. But you
don't go around abandoning gov-
ernment because it lsn't in the
trenches.’

The womell, who can be more
sure of returning next Septem—
ber, should appreciate an oppor-
tumty to give their suggestions
for a student government which
will be largely concerned with wo-
men next year. The men who may
be in uniform by next semester
should realize a deep current ob-
llgation to help put the student
body of this school on a firm foul.-
mg before he leaves. Who wants
to be “ex ‘44" from a school where
student government. weakened by
disinterest anyway, has complete»
ly snapped off in the first emer-
geney?

Student government here has
been “remodeled" before. We re-
member the days of the Constitu-
tional convention, when We all
Wailowed in legality. But this
time we are not writing a, fine
piece of confusion. This time
we want effective action on an
immediate problem. That action,
the present student council has
promised we will get. If you
want your opinions and ideas to
be included in the action, submit
them now, that they may be fair-
1y considered. if you’ve got
gripes, gripe now. Next year
we’ll be too busy.

Your house representative will
be asked his opinion next Mon—
day night. Be sure your opinions
are included in his repcrt. And
don't leave the pzesent council
alone with the problem.

This time the dream’s on you,
too.
