Tun GLEE Curr; makes its ﬁrst
appearance of the season tltis
evening and, ‘we hope, it will be a
successful prelude to the extends
ed trip to be taken this spring.

The members have worked hard
and faithfully, and Professor Cole,
as director, has been untn-ing in
his efforts to improve the work of
the organization. The member»
ship of the club differs but little
from that of last year, and this in
itseli is an advantage, since most
of the members have the beneﬁt
of last year's experience. The
club gaineda high reputation in
all the towns which it visited last
year; but. its engagements were
conﬁned to totvns in the northern
and central parts of the state.

This year, with a more extend-
ed trip in prospect, we expect to
see even greater reputation ace

Calocagathla.

The Calocagathians listened to
a Goethe program Friday. which
would hear no criticism unless its
length could be criticised. A pa-
per was prepared by Miss Galla-
her on ”Goethe’s Life,” showing
him a politician, phrlosophcr and
pOeL

Miss Martin
“Faust." and Miss
”\Nilhelm Meister."

Miss Patten read a paper on
uGoethe's Love Affairs," ivhiclt
was very interesting.

The program closed with some
tableaux from “Faust.” which were
very unique and the parts excep-
tionally well taken by Marie Bons-
quet as Mephistophelcs. Mabel
Frisbie and Matie Paul as Faust
and Marguerite.

The program was varied by so-
los from Misses Parker and Case.

had a revicw or’
Wheeler of

Dr. Herron on Armenia.

In a late number of 77w Kings
dam, Dr. Herron gives some new
views on the Armenian situation.
He disclaims any intention oi jlts
trtying the Armenian massacres,
which, he says, have only too
slightly aroused the anxiety and
indignation ot christentlonr. He
oﬂers only an explanation, nota
justiﬁcation, of the Europcan atti~
tude townrd Armenia and Trrr hey.

He says that he is thoroughly
convinced that the Armenian Del.
secutions are not religious in their
cause. or are but incidentally so.
The Armenians are not persecuted
because they are Christians, not
even because they are Armenian
in nationality; they being
massacred and cllivcn from their
homes primarily because they are
obtaining, and that very rapidly,
the property of the Turks both in
Europe and Asia.

The, Kurds and soldiers who do
the killing and I'avaging could, of
course, give no such deﬁnite rea-
son for their monstrous act .
Their religious passions, and pas-
sion for plunder. are bcingnrought
upon to serve the ends ot nlas-
sacrc and desolation; but the port»
ers behind the soldiery and Kurds
islt cavalry know thut without an
early change in the economic de.
velopment of the Tul'lusl‘r empire,
the Turks will become the den
pendents of the Armenians, the
hardest, grecdlest and most cun~
ning and most unscrupulous ot
masters to serve. It seems com-
monly contcssed by both triend
and fee that the Armenian excels
all known people in getting the
better of bargains and in the title
failing use ot artiﬁce to gain his

arc

ends.

Dr. Herron does not mean to
charge upon the ttholc people the
faults or even their representative
commercial, political and religious
leaders, that would be both
truthful and unjust.

But in spite or his sympathies,
the conviction is forced upon an
observer that the helpless thotr
sands ot Armenians are being
ground between the upper mills
stone of the greed and intrigue of
their own commercial, ecclesiasti-
cal and revolutionary lenders and
the nether millstonc ot the eco-
nomic and political despair or the
Turkish “powers that be.” The
ank is in that positron where hc
sees no choice between extermi-
nating or permanently crippling
the Armenian, and surrendering
both his political existence and
economic independence.

Dr. Herron’s statements. while,

un»

massacres, llrrotv entirely new
light on the Armenian question,
and show it to be on a drlierent
basis than the one which has hith-
erto been accepted.
