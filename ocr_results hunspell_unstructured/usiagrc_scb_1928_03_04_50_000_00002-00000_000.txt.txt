Before thc tinal curtain is rung down in this little epi—
sode in the SCARLET AND BLACK editorial hallo). we
should like to state our position as well as to make cer—
tain matters clear, even it it means dragging the family
skeleton out uf the closet. . '

The charge has been made at chapel. to certain Slur
dents and in various organizations, that a condition or
apathy 'lSLS among tho inch or this collcgc. In feeble
protest it was said that this charge camc iroiu certain
disgruntled alumni who wished they were liiillg in the
golden age oi the past when student opinion was quick
to be expressed and more quickly put into tangihlc ac
tion. We do not go the whole length with this group
who have a hackuard look. We shall, howcvcr, go part
of tlic nay. Their charge is hascd on tact. We are ana-
thaliC#gi'hsSly so. lion-over, we would rather that the
golden age of the past could he revived, rather than our
being relegated to that past.

At present their are two questions hctorc the strident
body oi Grinnell. These questions are vital and hasic.
They are two or the things upon which our claim to dis
tinction among liberal arts colleges rests. They are the
determination of our athletic status and the organization

may he ti tits-sod Jointly siucc tlirir solution is hindered
l,- tho same chronic t-niiseiilpﬂlliy.

Tho athletic prohlcm is entirely in the hands at the
laculty. A member ot tiic laciilti- committcc loi- uant
cl dciiiutc sluduul opinion has licou known to ask quite
casually a ccrtaiu stnticnt who in our opinion does not
ioicc popular scutimcnt—granting there is such a thing,
what the men ot Griuncll thought at the situation. Is
our organization right when such an important reaction
must be sought out through a sinslc casual question?

Who plays on our teams? Who supports our athletic
program? Who is it that heuciits [ruin a strong athletic
program in every case it is the student hotly.

And rot—have the students declared their wish in the
matter oi the rcorgani ition or tlir hiissouri Valley con—
icrcncc:7 Though we would decry any such action, we
contend that our aililiation with a minor coiitercucc is
routing ut upon the stutleuls’ opinion, As it is. tiic race
lilly '11 make an alliance; it uiil he made known to the
studcnt hody; and that hody will mockiy accept it without
ever liming a voice in it.

it is not our intention to hclittle the service, the time
and energy spent on the problem hy the tocuity commie
too which has the students interest at heart, But
couldn't we help this committee hy a deiinitc exui‘esV
siou oi sentiment for this or that alliance, it is too late
tor the addition of a strident committee to aid the athletic
committee, even it it were possihlc to have a mint coni-
mittcc. liowcvcr, it is not too late ior the student hotly
to stain tiicir wishes in the matter.

in the matter ol the reorganization oi men's govern-
mcut thc eyes or the coiiutry are upon us. Griuucll has
advcrtiscii itscit- as the center nt stndcnt cyprcssion and
sell-government. I-Icadlincs hroadcasted to the state that
student government was suspended through implied tails
are. But do headlines tell the some people that thc stu-
dent hody has mot and evolved a new system at governs
incut, ouc more in keeping with the times? Griuncil is
one at the whole list at colleges and universities that
states as its purpose the making ot citizens. This is im-
douhtcdly a statement carried over from the old univen
si es ot ancient Greece, ivlici-e government was import-
ant. However, it we are the future governors and gov»
ernca ot the nation, \louldn't it hc well to demonstrate, at
least to ourselves, that we are capable ol governing and
hcing governed?

It is on r contention that the personncl oi the joint
taculty and student committee i‘s unkowu to the students
through lack at iutcrcst. nor is there any criort to follow
its uorlt which is not being kept secret. Certain oi the
committee complain that their work is heing handicapped
through lack ol maniiestntion of student dcsirc upon
which to pass their actions.

We reiterate a previous statement on this page that
this committee has found tile key to the situation and in
rebuilding the structure of student government will have
a bedrock (mutilation. The committee has done so in
spite ol the students rather than through them.

it is our hope that the student leaders will recognize
the apathy extant, and that they will attempt to solve
those (“‘0 problems by intelligent leadership. Much can
he done in uniting the men through the bonds of common
interest and mutual welfare. Once united, there is no
doubt that a speedy, eliicient anti neceplablevsolutiou will
be offered to aid the faculty in their work,
