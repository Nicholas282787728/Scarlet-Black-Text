Vladimir Sakharov. a iormer KGB agent
and Soviet diplomat. stopped in Mars
shalltoivn recently ior a press conierencc.
He is now considered a top American ex-
port on SovietAinerican relations,

Sakhamv has resided in the United
States [or the last 14 years. He detected
from the USSR due to disiliusionment with
the KGB and a personal affinity for the
West, He states that his reasons tor the
move were basically personal. not
political

Sakharov's main area of concern in his
remarks was the misconceptions which
the American and the Soviel peoples have
about each other He believes Americans
perceive the Soviets as much more cold.
much more evil than they really are. He is
upset by the influence exerted on
Ameiican ideas by images such as those in
the iilm Rocky Iv and a recent commer-
cial for Wendy's Hamburgers.

He stressed that not all Soviets are Com-
munists. not all are KGB. as many
Americans imagine. They have liic,
culture, and a great hunger [or western in-
fluences. ranging from ballet to Pat
Benatar. These. according to Sakharov.
are far irom giving an accurate picture of
Soviet life.

Not all of what Sakharov said painted a
rosy picture however He believes that a
true friendship betwéen the USSR and the
USA is impossible. because the two coun-
tries are simply too diilerent in their
values. He stressed that what is important
to the Soviet citizen is order and control. as
opposed to the American love oi liberty.

Due to these Values Sakharov stated
the Soviet people have a very high regard
for the institutions of the country He
claimed that if given the chance 99% of
the people in the USSR would join the
KGB, They are also Very negative toward
dissidents, who are perceived as “rocking
the boat.” or destroying the underlying
order oi die society

Sakhai‘ov also had some disheartening
aromments on the future of arms control
He believes that the Soviet Union will
never engage in drastic disarmament.
mostly because of the threat posed to them
by China. The Soviets. according to
Sakharov. have a deepsscated fear of the
Chinese which will never let them relax
their delenses toniar:

He does. however. believe that disarma-
ment can be achieved on some levels. and
that we should continue to Work toward it.

Dealing with the Soviets will become
more diliicult in the future. however. ac-
cording to Sakharov. due to the ascension
to power of Mikhail Gorbachev and the
younger members oi the Politburo. in the
lluture the Soviet diplomats Will he increas-
ingly sophisticated, Sakharov stated,

He also believes that. the Soviets will. in
the luture. become much more Involved in
the area of international business and will
be increasingly astute businessmen.

Sakharov's prediction of the expansion
of the Soviet Union into international
markets reﬂects his behef‘ in the slnccrity
of Gorbachev s desire for economic
reform He Cited three small industries
which, Gorbachev is using as an experi-
ment in monetary incentives, but stressed
their minor nature,

The problem ahead for Soviet economic
reform. as Sakharov sees it. lies in the
heavily layered power structure prevail»
ing in the factories The strength of this
bureaucracy. with its wellentrenched
privileges. is the main obstacle to sue
cessful reform. he (eels.

Though many of Sakharov's comments
stressed the differences between the USA
and the USSR. he was on the whole fairly
optimistic. it is his hope that the future will
bring the two countries to an increasingly
accurate understanding of each other. And
through understanding he believes we can
learn to live with each other

“Kinship” cares

by Lisa Grant

Students often complain that Grinnell
College is isolated. cut-off from the “real”
world.

You only need to take a good look at the
composition oi the college to realize how
true this is: we eat. sleep. live. study. work
and play with people between the ages oi
18 and 22 Besides some contact with pro»
fessors and RA's and minimal interaction
with Buildings and Grounds stall. 18/22 is
it!

Getting oil. campus and involved with
the Grinnell community is the only way out
or age-group isolation. And the Grinnell
Kinship program is one of the best ways to
do it.

The Kinship program is similar to the
Big Sister/Brother program in other [is
cities. The program pairs up older in
dividuals with 'kids who would like a kin-
ship partner ior whatever reason: so»
meone to talk to. someone to have fun with.

The voice of the NAACP has been a
primary mice in initiating legislation

A 1910 issue oI “Grins". the magazine ol

women who made up the NAACP in its
beginning were colored and white
Americans of all classes and creeds who

sidious enemy this country faces and are
