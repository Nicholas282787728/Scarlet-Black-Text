For better or for worse he has sur

penny. It would provide a gathering
place much more private and aImOA
spheric than the Forum Grill, with
better opening hours to boot. It might
even serve as a club-like venue for
small gigs and performing acts.

A kick start from the student gov~
emment alone, however. is not sufﬁ-
cient. Student involvement is also
necessary to make this scheme suc»
cessful and prevent it from withering
like so many other campus organiza-
tions. People who volunteer now to
assist with the development of the
coffeehouse are helping something
that Page 3 is bound to be in the long

that Page 3 is bound to be in the long
term interest of Grinnell students.
Supporters of the coffeehouse will
also doubtlessly send by way of their
actions a long-overdue message to
,the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs. SGA
and the studentbody must ensure that
this message is heard by making a
concerted political effort to ensure
that this scheme stands as a success
ful precedent to greater student con-
trol of the Forum and Harris Center
rather than a one-time flash in the
pan. Strong studentaetion of this na
ture would do much to persuade the
mandarins of Student Affairs to put
faith in the ability of SGA to run the
social facilities on this campus.

religious, and economic rivalries,
some of which have just begun to
emerge. Far from a world commu»
nity. what we will have in the next
century is a mess of waning tribes.
The future will be bloodier, more
vicious, and marked by more chau-
vinism than any period in the past.
“Preparation for the 21st century"
demands that we recognize this.

But the survey breezily re—
fers to a “global community." Fur-
thcrmore, the survey does notask us

whether we supporttheadvancement
of “multiculturalism;" it merely asks
how this can best be done. The as-
sumption seems to be that if the ad
ministration desires it. we must de-
sire it too, like good lapdogs.

I'd like to conclude by not- A

ing that it‘s rather ironic that thecalls
formulticulturalism are coming from
the left. No one who opposes raCism.
sexism, or “homophobia" can propr
erly argue that the West is not supe-
rior to other cultures, since these atti-
tudes are endemic to non-European
cultures.
