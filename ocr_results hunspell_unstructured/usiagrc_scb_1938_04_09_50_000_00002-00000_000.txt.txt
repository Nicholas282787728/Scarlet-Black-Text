CONGRATULATIONS, ROBERT MOEHL

To the newly elected president of the Student Council,
Robert Moehl, congratulations from the Scarlet and Black.

No one knows better than you the task which lies be
fore you and your colleagues. Under the capable leadership
of John Spence the Student Council has, this year, accom-
plished great things.

You have in your own right accomplished great things.
As chairman of the White house committee, you have done
a difficult job extremely well. Judging by your record in
that capacity, we are confident of your future success.

THINK BEFORE YOITVSTE‘

Next week the men of Grinnell will be called upon to
vote in an election of the greatest importance to themselves.
We refer to the election of house presidents Monday night.

Coming as it does near the end of a long series of
elections of Various sorts, this particular election is liable
to the danger of apathy on the part of the voting men

It is worthwhile to remember that a little serious
thought beforehand is more likely to get good house presi—
dents than is emotional voting in the house meetings.

YOU CAN'T uroﬁdﬁs n

Sunday afternoon the Vesper choir under the direction
of Elias Blllm will present a program of music by Johann
Sebastian Bach in place of the usual Vesper service. This
program is an annual feature of the college year, and one
which holds out a very real cultural opportunity.

Bach is recognized as a master in the type of sacred
music to be presented Sunday, and it is fortunate that there
is on the campus a group of musicians capable of doing
justice to his works. Such a program is not in any sense
a light one. It is, on the other hand, enjoyable.

It is in fact a program that no one can afford to miss.

NOT HARD T0 TWGi

The coming week is marked by the observance on this
campus, through the medium of a series'of chapel services,
of Holy week, the week between Palm Sunday and Easter
when Christian peoples make a special point of religious
Observances.

Wholellearted attendance at tile programs to be given
this week will be of definite value to the individual. in
troubled times such as these, and ill the midst of the per-
plexing problems of college life, such programs serve a
valuable purpose in developing a calm, serene outlook on life.
