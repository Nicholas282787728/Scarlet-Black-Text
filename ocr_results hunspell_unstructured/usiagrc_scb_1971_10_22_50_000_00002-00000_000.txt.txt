Dawson Compares Colleges: G

by Kyle Schaub

Economics proiessor John Dawson has
returned to orinneil alter teaching two
years at Makerere University in
Kampala. Uganda’s capital city, sports
sored by the Rockeieller Foundation‘s
University Support Program.

Last March, the sol; printed Mr. Dawe
son's letter about his personal lnlpres~
stons oi the successitil Jan. 24 military
coup oi the Ugandan government which
took place in Kampala Now the side
would like to consider what other im-
pressions Proi. Dawsonhas aboutUganda
and the University,

"Makerere University has 3,000 slur
dents. so in size its not so tar irom
Gl‘inllell,“ Mr. Dawson startedout. Their
strong departments outside the liberal
arts are medicine and agriculture in
tact, it you graduate with a medical (lea
gree irom Makcrere. you can practice
medicine in England without reexamin’ds
lion."

“Makerere is a threeryear college,"
Prof. Dawson Continued. “But since the
school system in Uganda is patterned
like the British. the secondary Schools
last six years instead oi tour.”

tie added, “Parents must pay tuition
iees lor primary and secondary schools,
These costs represent a highpercentage
oi the lamily's income. Sending thechild
to school is a thing ol pride aitd iamily
sacritice since Ugandans are mainly
peasant tarmers They receive a break.
however, when the child enters the Uni
versity because tuition. room. board,
and even books are tree,“

“Just because Makerere is in Airica."
Mr. Dawson emphasized, “doesn’t mean
It’s primitive Makerere as a university
is quite comparable in quality to Grins
nell. right down tothelibraryanddorms.

The method at teaching dil'ters though
Makerere uses large lectures, as is the
British Custom. Another reason (or 1907
late classes is a larger student/iaculty
ratio.”

Mr Dawson contitiued. “An interesting
iact to note is that while tltestudentsare
almost all Airican. only halioitheteach-
ing stalt is black The otherhaltis mainly
British, with a mixture or others like
myseli Ugandanization oi the start as
soon as possible is a central aim oi the
University."

one oi the targestdiiierencesMr Dawe
son pointed oiit was the iinal goal ola
college education "in Uganda." hesaid.
“a university graduate becomes ameni-
ber oi a certain class. so the purpose
oi school is to achieve this status and
the white collar job attached to it. This
contrasts with the American goal or
teaching students how to do their jobs
well. One wonders a bit about the Libs
et-al Arts viewpoint in Airica ”

Tltis attitude was inherited by the
Ugandans when they gained their inder
pendence in 1962 and is a continuing
ieature at their education system as a
whole ‘This is ultlortunate.“ Mr Daws
sou stated. "because Airica needs We
cationally trained workers very badly,
in areas like tnodern tarming and auto
mechanics where there is a severe
shortage. Right now, there aren’t any
technical high schools and tithe stu~
dents don't pass the British University
entrance exams. they will probably have
to return to iarmtng without having re-
ceived a practical education.”

Curricuitim is Another area Mr paws
son commented upon "Airtcans maynot
care it the curlculum is useiui to them.
But there is another side tbtheproblem:
Are the teachers»especially thoseirom
abl~oad~nbie to give knowledge that is
useltll?”

in attempting to iuliilt hislast question,
Mr Dawson said. "To make economics
usciul to lliem. we tried to use Airican
examples and statistics. But whether
the theory heingjustiiied actually applied
to Airican conditions is very hard totell.
i think that most oi otir economic theory
is based on European and Alnericanecos
iiomic institutions. institutions that

hardly take the same form in Alrica,"

A criticism Prol Dawson had about
the British-styled University concerned
the grading system, “To say the least,
il‘s cumbersome procedure.” he said
”imagine an exam paper has been writ-
ten and now is ready ior grading. First
the student’s teacher assigns the initial
grade, Then the exam is graded by other
teachers in the department. Then the
department meets anddiscusseachcxam
grade. Next. an external examiner irom
the United Kingdom reads all the papers
and decides whether the iaculty has
scored the exam properly. (This ‘oulr
Side' help was iormerly to maintain
University oi London standards on the
exams ”

Mr Dawson continued, “Alter the exa-
miner checks over the tests, the whole
department meets again with the exa-
miner to re-evaluate all ol the papers
Then the whole division. made up oi
several departments. reviewsthegt-ades
again. Finally, the University Senate.
an elected laculty body. reviews the
scores and gives iinal approval ior the
individual student "

Alter saying the above. Proi Dawson
chuckled, “Oh yes. i forgot to mention
that even before the exam is given, the
department and tile external examiner
must approve the questions on it."

Another ditlerence between Mdkerere
University and U s colleges is the
awarding oi degrees, Uganda iollows
the British custom of [our levels. Iirst

class and pass degrees. “It the student
wants to go to n graduateschuol, he must
have at leasl an upper second Class de-

class.” Prof. Dawson explained “Also,
