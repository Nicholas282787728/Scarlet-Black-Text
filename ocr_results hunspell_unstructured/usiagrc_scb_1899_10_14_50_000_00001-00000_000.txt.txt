Ellis.

The meeting oi the Ellis socie-
ty opened with an instrumental
solo by Miss~Cox, which was
heartily eilcored. Miss \Vllllams,
in a paper on “The Mistakes or
the Notables," concrsely and clear-
ly described the character- and
conduct of the French nobility
prior to the Revolution. The tide
bility had taken the place of the
feudal barons at this period, and
repelled taxation as degrading,
while ihey bccanle heavily lnr
volverl through luxurious living
and prodrgality. They prided
themselves upon their negligence
and depended upon royal iavors
and moneyed marriages to keep
up their standing. Finally the
nobles themselves became disconr
tented and embittered, and popu-
lar nrurmirr, raised against them,
hastened the impending crisis.

Miss Finer, in her paper on the

 

'oi

transformation of the States Gen
eral into a Constitutional Convenr
tiorr, spoke or the kindly dispoe
sitioii and good intentions of
King Louis XVI. The States
General was summoned, after an
interval of one hundred and ﬁfty
years. because oi the alarming

condition or the government. All

classes ‘\\CtC invited to present
petitions and concessions- in the
way of representation nere made
to the Commons. At the open»
of the States General the

Commons had high expectations
national regeneration. But
the government had no deﬁnite
plans. and wavered about ior
\tceks. while excitement in Idlls
deepened and the breach between
the government and the commons
widened. The latter became pro»
nounccd in self assertion and at
last, taking mattersintotheir own
hands, constituted themselves the
.‘n’alional Assembly or France.

one or the most enjoyable lea-
tiiies of the program was a vocal
solo by Miss Body. which has so
heartily applauded, that she le-
sponded with a touching little
ltlllab'y, in which the sweetness of
her voice found even better ex
pression than betoie.

Tire cxtemporaiicous work con
sisted of talks upon "President
McKlnley’s Tour” by Miss Meh-
lrn; “Affairs in Transvaal” by
Miss Ol‘vts, and "The White Man's
Burden irl Chirlzt” by Miss Marsh.
The different topics were clearly
presented, but the use of notes by
some of the speakers detracted
somewhat from their value. Work
of this kind is expected to be a
test of memory, in addition to
other advantages.
