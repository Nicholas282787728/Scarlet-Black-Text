Dear Editor.

The following is a list of shortrterm and
long-term goals put together by the
members of the Grinnell College Womens’
Health Care committee This committee
was formed in response to a concern on
campus that Grinnell College and the Grins
nell community serverely lack low cost
women's health care services.

Short-Term Goals

1. To establish a satellite family plannr
ing clinic which will:

A. Be available to Grinnell College and
the Grinnell community on a part-time
basis

Birth control and family planning

Treatment of minor gynecological

Pap smears

Referral services to a gynecologist

(The satellite clinic will not perform
abortions.)

_ pinion

cesstul. After this has been accomplished,
we would like the clinic to expand its ser
vices (but not necessarily its space) to pro
vide:

form of'
A, a visiting gynecologist
B. a satellite gynecological office.
II. A Women’s Resource Center which

Spring breaks are wasted on me, I don’t
know why. but I never really have as much
fun as I feel rm probably supposed to
have.

m sure I'm not the only one. There are
some people, like me, who are just not
good at thinking ahead more than a few
days at a time The result of this is that
every year, when March rolls around and
all my friends and classmates are piling
into cars. buses, and airplanes and
heading to some balmy, sunrdrenched
locale on the coast, I end up staying at
home. sprawled on the couch for two

the Outside

warned me about this when I Was down
there last summer, and l wentnaively run»
ning across the sand towards the bright
blue water, anticipating a clean,
refreshing romp through the sparkling
waves. only to find that after about a
minute of exposure to the lukewarm,
spitllerlike sea, i felt myself coated with _a
Crust of corrosive sodium which found it’s
way into every crack and cranny of my
nearly naked body. As my skin began to
wrinkle and crawl, I suddenly felt like a
very large hunk of corned beef, It wasn't
long before i was back in the clean, safe,
chlorinated waters of the ocean-Side pool

tournament and MTV broadcasting live
from Daytona Beach, which, in case
anyone doesn’t know, is now the official
spring break capital of the world.

it's juSt as well, i suppose. i can't pic-
ture myself on the beach anyway. I went to
Florida once, and 1 just didn't fit in. My
physical appearance did not mesh well
with the scenery. People in Florida don't
have love handles, or hairy feet, and they
don't carry faded Superman towels from
the midrSeventies, And although it's cer-
tainly true that I wouldn’t be the only pale
Midwesterncr shining brightly on the
beach this time of year, 1 still can’t help
but feel that i would be painfully out of
place down there in the tropics. Some of us
weren't made to walk around with our
shirts oft. At least not in broad daylight.

Besides all that, 1 really don't find the
ocean all that pleasant. For one thing, you
can't swim in it. or at least I Can't. This
isn’t because the water is dangerous, or
cold, or polluted, but, in case some of you
didn’t know, the ocean is full of salt. It’s
like wading in used gargle water. Nobody

which the hotel had so nicely proVided: 1
had been wondering, up to that point, why
anybody would want to swim in a pool
when the ocean was right there. Now I
know, Yuk.

Actually, I find chlorinated water only
slightly more pleasant than salt water. i
always end up swallowing it and it makes
my throat hurt and it pickles my eyeballs
and makes my hair feel like dead grass.
When it comes to bodies of water, I’ll take
a good, mud»bottomed, seaweed-infested
lake any day. Maybe that's what I’ll do
next year for spring break. I could find a
nice big lake in Wisconsin or Minnesota,
and spend my days leisurely enjoying the
pleasant, cool, crisp spring weather. Ac-
tually, now that I think about it, a northern
lake is a wonderful vacation alternative to
Jamaica or California. After all, the
crowds probably wouldn't be nearly as
bad. And you wouldn‘thave to worry about
how tan you were, either. when you’re
wearing long underwear, no one can see
your skin.

1 think I‘ll buy my tickets today.

This week’s topic is: oppression. Oppres-
sion here, in the United States of America.
its laws have placed countless people in
jail for crimes of consciousness; they
decided to exercise the freedoms that they
believed they were entitled to. The govern-
ment felt otherwise; they have arrested
over 6,000,000 people since 1969 for these
acts of “immorality.” It is based on ideas
that were rejected by this country, in a
slightly different form, more than fifty
years ago! Yet, as recenty as 1934, U.S.
citizens were being arrested at a rate of
more than one every 90 seconds! if you
haven’t already guessed, this oppression l

’ View from the Throne

The supporters of Marijuana Prohibition
point to the healﬂi risks involved with pots
smoking, but the numbers don't back them
up. In 1979, over 200,000 people DIED from
tobacco smoking; over 19,000 people DIED
from alcohol (not including the 50 percent
ot highway deaths and murders associated
with alcohol); over llm people DIED from
aspirin; over 7,000 people DIED from
overdoses of prescription tranquilizers.
Yet NOT ONE SINGLE DEATH HAS
EVER BEEN REPORTED FROM MARI-
JUANA OVERDOSE! Every study done in
American universities has shown that pot
toxicity does not exist.

 

“The government is legislaiing how adult
tax-paying, US. Citizens can ad in The
privacy of their own homes! In doing so,

they are Violating our
privacy.”

constitutional right ‘to

 

speak of is the Marijuana Prohibition.

It is time to put an end to Marijuana Pros
hibition. First of all, there would be great
benefits from the legalization and regula-
tion of pot. Marijuana is already the
number-two cash crop in the entire coun~
try! Over $30 billion was spent on pot in the
U. last year, If the cultivation and
dis ribution of marijuana were regulated,
not only would we be turning :30 billion
away from organized crime and into the
GNP, we would also generate up to $6
billion in social security and income taxes.

But more important, Marijuana Prohibi-
tion should be dismantled because it is im-
moral, The government is legislating how
adult, tax~paying, U.S. Citizens can act IN
THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN
HOMES! In doing so, they are violating
our constitutional right to privacy. it is un
just for a government to pass laws that can
be enforced only by breaking other laws.
This is but one of the Contradictions in the
“War on Drugs."

The last few years have seen this "War
on Drugs” reach unprecedented levels of
injustice, hysteria, and paranoia. Last
summer, a Wisconsm man, arrested for
harvesting wild marijuana plants, was
handcuffed and shot twice in the head by a
fanatical, “anti-drug," Reaganrite
policeman! The cop's lawyers pleaded
”not guility by reason of insanity” to the
charge of firstrdegree murder. ln another
case, the assistant principal at Dley High
School in Pennsylvania strippedsearched
the entire male population of the school‘
His reason was the spotting of a
“cigarette-like ob’lect” two weeks earlier!
Of course, no drugs (legal or illegal) were
found.

And when lies, Violence, and hysteria
don’t work, the prohibitinnists suppress
the truth. Government officials have made
such ridiculous claims as, ”Pot causes
AIDS!" and “Pot causes brain damage! ”
In the latter study, for instance, it was true
that one group of rats tested did develop
brain damage. What the fanatics don’t tell
you is that the equivalent dosage for that
group was over 100 joints per day for 30 to
40 years! When will the truth come out?

The right of each adult to choose for
himself whether to smoke pot is not the
government‘s to give or take. It is clear
that our attitudes toward marijuana
should change. It is time we replaced
Marijuana Prohibition with a program of
intelligent and informed choice.

That is why a Grinnell chapter of the Na-
tional Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML) is being forms
ed NORML is a nationally recognized
authority on drug laws in this country —
laws that effect our lives, like urinalysis,
possession ‘of marijuana, and cultivation of
marijuana. NORML is also an activist
group, lobbying at the local, state, and na
tional levels to change the laws concerning
the possession and use of marijuana in this
country. This group will have its first
meeting today, at 4:30 in the Forum Coffee
house. if you are interested in getting in
volved, but cannot make the meeting,
please contact me, sending your name and
box number to Box LSD. Everyone who
joins our chapter will be given a free, one
year membership in NORML. (Most of the
information in this article was provided by
NORML and NORML Projects Coor-
dinator, Burt Neal.)
