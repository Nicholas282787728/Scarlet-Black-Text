Interest" That’s All

Three types of students inhabit the Grilmell campus.
The first, the Eager (a minority), is likely to satisfy a
consuming hunger for knowledge by pouncing on professors
after class to ask for extra work. The second and largest
group, the Reserved, is interested, but shuns anything likely
to label him an apple-polisher. And then there is tlle In-
different, who usually spends his time sleeping in the back
row. ,
The first and third types of students have very set
ideas about colloquiulns. The Eager never misses olle, and
the Indifferent wouldn’t be caught dead near one A 601*
loquium is not a meeting of subversives, nor is there a
minimum IQ requirement. It is simply. a meeting of persons
interested in its palticular subject

The only qualification is interest. The Reserved type
seems to fullfill that requirement.

A Detached Vie'w

Printed on this page is a letter from Donna Erickson.

Donna, whom we don't know, is perturbed over the answers
Grinnell students made two weeks ago to the old question:
“Why do you think so many students want to leave Grin-
hell ‘3” '
She seems to be perturbed not because of the answers
in themselves, but that we have accepted them, So, from
her detached outlook at the University of Minnesota, Donna,I
has sent her advice down here. To show our appreciation,
the least we can do it follow it.

Review'

Herva Nelli Wins Audience

by Eleanor Wilcox and Ron
.

Jensen

Over two hundred Grinnell
students lost an opportunity last
Monday night to hear one of
the 'finest soprcnos of our day.
Herva Nelli, although burdened
by a heavy program, thogoughly
won her audience with her out
standing voice and vocal control.

The program included a wider
variety of literature. Part one
consisted oi two Arias, “Pei- la
Gloria” of Bononcini and Beeth-v,
aven‘s “Ah, Piel'fido." The secondi
group, which had decidedly moi-cl
:appeal to the audience, estahr
iishcd a rapport between the art
ist and her hearers that was
maintained throughout the reel
mainder of the concert. or spe-
cial note in this French group
were ”C” by the contemporary
composer, Poulenc, and “Chant
Hindim” by Herman chberg,
also a contemporary.

Part three contained the dra-
matically beautiful “D'amor sulr,
Ali Rosee" from “Travatore” by
Verdi, The Spanish group which
followed was especially well res

much contrast in moods and was
beautifully executed by Miss
Nelli. Her artistic expressiveness
was particularly apparent in the
”Ave Maria" from Verdi’s
“Otello.” For cncorcs Miss Nelii
chose ”Visi D'Artc" from “Tosca”
by Puccini and “Come Back to
Sorrento." The former was one
of the outstanding highlights of
the evening.

To the students of Grilmell col-
lege:

i am, unluckily, not one oi the
student body at Grim-tell. 1 do
subscribe to the 5&3, and after
reading the Jan. 23 issue, 1
would like to offer my unbiased
opinion (I think) on the ques»
tion: “Why do you think so
many students want to leave
Grinnell?” _

From the reactions given by
five students, 1 gather the an.
swer would be inot enough
social life, too much discipline,
and not enough student responr
sibility. ,

in the first place, the faculty
probably would lift some of the
disciplinary measures and restricV
tions if the student body would
show that they are old enough
to accept the responsibility that
goes with adulthood.

In the second placc, if stu-
dcnts feel that they aren't be-
ing included in social life or
that social activities are limited
in variety, they should form a
group to see the right-author
ities about starting new activities.
After all. the faculty isn‘t go-
ing to give you what you wani‘
unless you let them know in the
right way where the program is
lacking. Certainly griping isn't
going to help one bit.

1 am of the opinion that the

it is a smaller college, and not

But if a studenlrfeels he

cause of lacking s '1 life or

problems could probably be
solved, why doesn’t he leave the

like the college the way it is
than those who are dissenting.

Finally, why doesn’t each dis»

going to college. To have a well

from parental restrictions? You
should be in a college to gain
an education—from book and in
