After their disappointing loss against Simpson
College the baseb ill team fell into a slump, winning
only one oftheir next torn- games.Thc Pioneers seem
to have shaken themselves out of their depression,
breaking out of their losing streak and putting up
three wins in a row before splitting a doubleheader
against Central College on Tucsdav

The baseball team defeated nationally ranked
William Penn University last Wednesday and then
shut out the Prairie ﬁre during a doubleheader on
snnnday, April 15.

The Pioneers dropped the first game oftheir dons
bleheader against Central on Tuesday, but picked up
another win later that evening to close off an impres-
sive run over the last week, winning {out out of five
of their games.

“After our slump, we hit rock bottom. When we
got back to campus we sat down for about an hour
or so. We wanted to assess the problem," said Gary
Kahn '09. “Throughout those talks we really pulled
together,"

The next few games certainly revealed this re-.
newed focus of the baseball team. The Pioneers took
the lead againstWilliam Penn in the third inning off
the bat of Robbie Unsell '08 and held off the States-
men for the remainder of the game to take a win on
the road. William Penn's late rally in the eighth and
ninth innings was not good enough to overtake the
Pioneers. The Statesmen fell to the Pioneers with a
final score of4-3.

In all five games, the pitchers presented a very
strong defense. The Pioneers used a total of eight
pitchers in the game againstWilliam Penn, but it was
Kahn who earned his second win of the season.

Kahn eontinued his streak against Knox, holding
ottthe Prairie Fire for almost two innings before giv-
ing up a run during the first game of the doubleheadr
er. Sam Eaton’07 took his third win of the season for
the same game.

“Every sin le person put us in the position to win

[is] play team baseball."

The series of victories has given the Pioneers
a boost of conﬁdence and left them very optimistic
about their prospects for the remainder ofthe season
and their potential as team.

Men' 5 golf gears up for South Division MWC Tournament

The men 5 tennis team
is on a nine game win-
ning streak.

Grinnell defeated in ,
last two opponents.
LaWrence College and
Knox College 7-0.

The Pioneers will have
their last home game

of the season on Satur-
day against Monmouth.

The Pioneer mens golfteam finished m 13!» place
last Tuesday' at Simpson College with a team score
of 336.

Unfortunately for the Pioneers, the Indianola
country Club played a little more difficult than many
ofthe Grinnell golfers had hoped.

“Simpson was another very windy day in Iowa,'
said Jack Kennedy no we played some players that
had never played' in a college tournament and they
responded well given the conditions."

The weather for Grinnell's next competition, the
Monmouth Invitational, was perfect, allowing Grine
nell's top six golfers to ﬁnish a little lower than they

ntpeeted. Grinnell ﬁnished in eight place with a team
score of 323.

A few ofthe Pioneers were still a little disappoint—
ed with their play at Monmouth.

“I don’t think we played as well as we would have
liked to at Monmouth," said Ryan Long ’07. "The
weather was perfect and I think most of us expected
to post lower numbers than we did. Gibson Woods
[the Monmouth Golf Course] was playing pretty
tough though and the greens were a little dried out,
which made approach shots diﬁicult to judge."

“I have been a little disappointed with the semis
reney of our team," said Head Coach Greg Wallace.

“We had a eouple of good scores in the meets last

week, but the lack of a good third and fourth score
hurt in our overall performance."

The Pioneers have a very important tournament
just around the corner. After a non-conference match
»up at the Amana Colonies, the golfteam will revisit
the Gibson Woods Golf Course for the first halfof
the South Division Midwest Conference Tournament
on April 29.The Southern Division teams will come
to Grinnell the next day for the completion of the
tournament at the Oakland Acres Country Club. .

“The team is coming together pretty well," said
Long. “There is still a lot to accomplish in the next
two weeks before southern division, but we‘ll be
working on our games "

Softball: What goes up Inust come down nomeoames

The Grinnell softball team deﬁned
up and down last weekend, sweep—
ing a doubleheader against Knox and
then dropping a second doubleheader
against Lake Forest.

The split on the road makes the
Pioneers 5-4 in the Midwest confer-
ence with only four conference games
left to play.

The team got off to a good start
against Knox last Friday, clinching
a victory with a couple of key hits. A
trio of sophomores, Megan Germer,
KInnear Theobald and Bailey Burt, all
had RBI hits that gave the Pioneers
their 3,1 victory over Knox, Burt and
Theobald each went two for three at
the plate with an RBI and Gaby Flores
’09 pitched five innings, allowing just
one run on three hits to go with two
strikeouts.

The second game against Knox was
more of the same, with Grinnell tak-
ing a 64 lead in the ﬁfth of? an RBI
single from Sandra King '03 and a two
run double by Theobald. Emily Kolbe
'09 won: four for four at the plate with
an RBI and senior Karyn Wieland was
three for three with an RBI ofher own,

Grinncll ﬁnished its sweep of Knox
with an impressive 84 victory,

“The team knew that weekend
was going to be important," said Burt.
"on Friday we beat Knox but not by
the margin we had hoped. I think we
thought it was going to be a couple of
easy wins and Knox gave us their best
effort, played solid defense and had a

On Saturday, Grinnell leamcd thitt
Lake Forest also had a few kIds that

won for the Pioneers, but a late surge
from the Foresters, including a twtrmn
home run in the bottom of the s‘utth,
gave Lake Forest a 64 win.

Game two was a little more difﬁcult

for Grinnell as they fell behind IO 3
early Into the match. The offense could
not get going and the Lake Forest hit~
ters combined for 11 runs On 10 hits for
an lies victory over the Pioneers.

“Lake Forestjust kept after us," said
Kolbe. “Vl/e had the lead until the bots
tom of the sixth inning and they came
up with some big hits. The second
game we fell apart for a few innings
but we came back and ﬁnished strong.
That kind ofronghness was great to see
and hopefully we'll build on that this
week."

This week will certainly be an in
portant one for the softball team, as
they prepare to face off against Illinois
College in .\ coufercuce doubleheader
at home on Saturday.

“This weekend we need to be com-
pletely prepared and focused {or ouI
games against IC," said Getmcr. “I
think that they are most deﬁnitely bear
ablc.Wc have such a talented team, but
we need to play like we know we can
and be on top ofonr hitting and field
mg. We have to have these two wins in
order to go to the conference tourna»
ment, so you better believe we are going
to go out there ready to play."
