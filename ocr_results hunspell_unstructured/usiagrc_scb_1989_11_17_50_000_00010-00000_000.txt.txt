legesr

Tire top three teams and the top
four individuals would go on to the
nationals,butwith nationallyranked
St. Thomas, Carleton, St. Olaf,
Simpson and Concordia included in
the field, competition was intense.

Seniorloanne Sackett, determined
to qualify for nationals. went out
strong and hung tough as positions
in the top pack shifted and reshifted
throughout the race. Rounding the
last bend and heading for the final
straightaway, Sackett. true to her
racing style,sprintedthefinalstretch
and ﬁnished 8th overallr

Behind Sackett came Grinnell’s
ever-reliable pack‘of three 7 Heidi
I-‘reiburger, Christine Thorbum and
Susie Petherarn — finishing 43rd,

All of the Skull Crushers having
successfully crossed the finish line,

the team eagerly awaited the final ‘ .

tallies. Even before the results were

in, Sackett learned that she had ’

qualiﬁed for nationals, and watch

Joy and hugging everyone in sight,
there was no need for spectators to
ask about her race.

Also worthy of celebration was
the Skull Cmshers’ 7th place finish
in the region, an all—time high finish

for Grinnell women’s cross country. h

For 21 out of 22 Skull Crushers,
the season is over, but for Joanne

Swimmers
Host Dual
and Relays

“Opening with a bang" is the best
way to describe the Grinncll women
swimmer’s first weekend of compe-
tition. Tonight at 7 pm, the Pio-
neers swim Washington University
ofSt. Louis in a dual meet and host
the Gleysteen Relays tomorrow at
10 am.

Coach Sheila Cain said she ex-
pects hersquad to have its hands full
with Wash. U., noting the Bears are

‘ normally very strong and have had a
~ month more preparation than the

Pioneers

Cain also looks for die Gleysteen
Relays to be tough because some of
the competition comes from NCAA
Division I and 11 teams.

If youth is a plus, the women’s
swimming team should be strong.
Cain enters her second yearas coach
withonlythreeseniors,butshehasa
squad of 30 which features 14 letter-
winnersr

Last year the Pioneers swam to a .
second-place finish in the Midwest
Conference and a 3-2 dual meet
record. They also won the Small
College State Meet.

Coach Cain said she wants this
year‘s squad to challenge for the
league championship and possibly
senda few relay teams to die nation-
als. The squad will have to do it
without five-time All-American
Katy Furnish, who graduated last
spring. ,
