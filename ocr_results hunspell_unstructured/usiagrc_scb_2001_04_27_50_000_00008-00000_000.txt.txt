say whar sheywish, rhis righs ends where she sensibiliriesofrlie

So we proposed a eempromise. Our suggession involved
placing a disclaimer on she Films This disclaimer would have
explained rhe graphic nasure of the film and advised viewers
who did nos wish ro see is re dirccr sheir arsension elsewhere

of she audience would read rhe disclaimer, wareh rhe film so

shas members of she public couldll'r be allowed to decide for

Joint Board notes

Dear Editor,

1 would like so inform you and your readers about rhe
Joins Board meeting on 4.18.01. I am aware that shere was an
arrielc on rhis messing lasr week in she 3&8, as well as she
published minutes for rho meering. 1 round borh ofrliein par.
ricularly sparse on one orrhe central issues ofrhe mcesirig, rhe
subiees ofbringing Rick Corley's lawyer ro speak on campus.

There should be no doubs in your readers minds as so
whar really wens on as she muetlng. SGA is paying $650 for
thk Corley‘s lawyer so some so campus ro speak $150 dollars
is for her hour ofrirne giving me talk. The ress is apparenrly so

Apparenrly, rhis was supposed ro be an “under slie sable"

alone.

The three snorfle ﬁsh gracefully made their way
through the bluish-green evening sky towards the amber
glow orthe setting sun. When they got there, the Sun-
Oracle Jerry asked them what they wanted the mostin
the whole world. One orthe ﬁsh burst out, “I want to
dream!“ Oracle Jerry looked at the small ﬁsh with his
ﬂickering golden eyes and chuckled. ”Sillysnorﬂe fish,"
he said, "everybody sari dream, even you." One of the
other snorrle fish said "But Oracle Jerry, none of us
has had a dream since the three moons set in the East
across the Sea otwi'tehesl" A briefindecipheiable look
passed over Oracle Jerrys radiantroee, quickly replaced
by a broad smile. ”Go now, my ﬁshes, and tonight you
shall dream." A brief shadow seemed to dim the radi
once of Oratle Jerry. "Yes, tonight you shall dream.

Every day, I hear people complaining about same-
thing or other— eitherthey have too much work. or a
certain person is annoying than to death, or they
keep tripping on this one stair on their way up to
their room, or SOMETHING, So i ﬁgured that it would
be simple to convince somebody to write a rant for
me, especially since these things are so eomparatively
short. However, when i asked people. they all said,
”Um... I can’t think or anything." '

Now, this onndys me. Did I catch EVERVBODV on a
particularly good week? i doubt it. Instead, one pra—
spective renters request to be anonymous indicates
that people don’t think thattheir rants are important
enough to be a random rant. t assure all of you who
think this way, your rant IS important. Otherwise you
have to read dreck like this,

You know what is a really sad time? when you have
a lovely day basking in the sun, piled under home-
work that really doesn’t seem quite as awful spread
out on the lawn as it does staeked on your desk, and
around dinnertime you start to feel slightly dizzy and
overheatedi Why should Ifeel ill, you ask yourself. 1
had a non-stressful, yet productive day and the weather
is beuuhful. I even ute well and drunk enough Water,
you say. Then you look over your bare shoulder and
discover the culprit: a pink monster. The Sunburn.
Gets you every yeal: [suppose this isn't a rant against
Grinnell, nor the description of a problem that any-
one has the power to ﬁx. Von, reader, may take it as a
simple reminder to wear sunscreen even though the
Forum beach isn't a real beach.
