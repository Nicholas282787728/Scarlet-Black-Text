At The Movie

House...

SCOTT ANDERSON
ELEANOR DODSON

Scott‘s View:

Angus is a feel<good, coming—
of<age movie dripping with sappi—
ness. The movie hinges on the hope
that the audience will identify with
the outsiderstatusofrhe lead chatac<
ter, Angus, played by Charlie Tal—
bert.

Rookie actor Talbert is so con—
vincing as Angus that he keeps the
movie from dragging, Reportedly
discovered at a Wendy’s in Illinois,
Talbert is a genuine charmer.

George c. scort puts in a like-
able role as Angus' cranky grandfa—
ther. The two exchange insults
throughout the movie.

Angus isagawky,heavysetfresh—
man who has developed a crush on
the most beautiful girl in school,
Melissa. Oicourse, she isdaringrhe
quarterback of the football team, and
even when Angus, a linebacker,
makes great plays, Melissa doesn’t
notice.

Although Angus drags at the
beginning with the usual slewofpick—
onethergeek jokes, the meme picks
up speed when Angus is selected King
ofthe Winter Ball as a practicalioke.
Surprise, surprise, Melissa is the
Queen. Angus has several decent
scenes where he learns how to dance;
ﬁrst with spicy Rita Morena, and
then with an inﬂatable doll.

Although Angus is aimed at
kids, Talbert plays such a likeable

Scott: *‘ki

role rhar everyone Will be smiling by
the end of the show.

Eleanor‘s view:

Ah, high school, Savor those
memoriesioramornenr. Highsohool
sucked. You know it and I know it.
But along comes Augusto remind us
that it is still possible to beat the
system at its own game and come out
on top.

Takeanovenveight,highschool
misfit (Charlie Talbot), an attrac—
tive popular girl, the big rlance, and
highschoolinclllitsgloty(notmuch,
rightz). Play with those dynamics a
little bit and chaos is bound to break
loose. But chaos is all the fun, and
that‘s what Angus is: smart, fun, af-
fecting and just a little sly. Also
featuring George C, Scott and Kathy
Bates, Angus is a bright, wclleaCted
film.

While it would be hard to deny
the inevitableness of rhe plot, rhe
fun is in watching it all come about,
There’s very little to dislike about
Angus and plenty to enjoy. Slight.
but charming, Angus fits well into
the “family” movie genre, but not in
any limiting sense. If Hollywood
could focus just a fraction ofthe skill
andcare goinginto the current realm
of children's films on adult movies,
we’d all be the better for it.
