Ward Scores Class Domination ,

 

Audience Vote
Gives Grinnell
Debate Victory

Affirmative of” Pittsburgh
on Insurance Question

Loses Decision

Grinnell college debaters, uphold-
ing the negative of the unemploy~
ment insurance question, defeated the
University of Pittsburgh team in the
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium
last night. The decision was rendered
by vote of the audience.

Cyril Jacobs, first speaker for the
affirmative, stated that unemploy~
ment was due to the quick expansion
of industries, the unstabilization of
industry, and the introduction of ma-
chinery. The Pittsburgh team pro-
posed a plan whereby the employer
would pay 11/2 per cent of his pay-
roll for unemployment insurance.
This would provide a maximum of
$10 a week for 13 weeks for the un-
employed man and would be under
state supervision.

Favors Shorter Day

That there is no occasion to install
an expensive system of unemploy-
ment insurance was the first point
emphasized by Robert Blasier of the
negative. He quoted from census
bureau statistics to show that only
2 per cent of the population was out
of work. He advocated more governe
ment construction during periods of
depression, stabilization and Combine
ation of business, and a shorter work»
ing day.

Samuel Strauss, in his constructive
debate for the affirmative, made the
points that compensation from unem-
ployment insurance would tend to
shorten periods of depression, to pl‘e~
vent rash expansion, and to give re-
lief. If the employer were to pay a
penalty for each man discharged,
Strauss said, the employer would
consider his action thoroughly.

Plan Must Be Gradual

Lee Alexander said that the em-
ployer forced to pay a penalty for
each man discharged would find
some means of regaining his money,
either by raising the price of his pro»
duct, or by lowering the laborers’
wages. .

Grinnell in rebuttals brought our
the fact that a successful plan is
largely a process of gradual develop-

Coeds Prepare
Powdered Wigs
for Colonial Ball

With the approach of Washington's
birthday, minds of Grinnell coeds
turn to thoughts of the Colonial ball.
This annual affair, which will be held

outgrowth of an old practice, started
as an entertainment for Women's
Athletic association members only,
but which grew to include all Grin»

100 years at the ball and gay, laugh-
ing Marthas and jolly Georges frolic
about, forgetting the work»a»dav
world of today. Long, full—hooped
skirts, basque waists, powdered wigs,
swallow—tail coats, and picture lists
all make their appearance. Cares are
thrown aside and old-fashioned gal-
lants lead their ladies in the Virginia
reel, the rye waltz. and the firefly
dance, which always concludes the
evening.

Although the women attend in
gala attire, men gain entrance as
spectators. They are allowed to Sit
in the balcony and gaze at the
picturesque scene below, The ball will
take place in the parlor of an old
fashioned mansion, with its panelled
walls. portraits, ﬁreplace, and chande-
liers.

Mary Pierce heads the ball com-
mittee with Helen McLeran in charge
of the lighting. other W. A. A hoard
members will assist in decorating.

Preceding the ball the Georges and
Marthas will dine in costume in the
quadrangle dining room.

Lloyd Lahsrud, one of the nation's
premier polesvaulters, was out of
competition with the Gophers because
of illness, but should be a cinch for

may score a slam in this event as
both Collins and Johnson have done
12 feet this season. This pair ﬁnished
onetwo against Minnesota,

Capt. Del Podrebarac is Drake's
hurdle ace and also does some high
jumping and sprinting. Frank Smith
is the chief Bulldog dash man, with

“It's more fun to live today. There
are more things moving.” said Harry
Frederick War-d, professor of Christ»
ian Ethics at Union Theological sem»
inary, who is in Grinnell this week as
the Gates Memorial speaker, in a
discussion of this modern but compli-
cated age.

He feels, however, that there is a
difference in youth ofltodaty. whodoes
not take things for granted but is
more curious. “But the question res
mains,” added Mr. Ward, “what will
they do with the facts that they have
discovered? Today's youth thinks
more scientifically than before, so it
can hardly be said that the modern
youth is capable of doing better
thinking.

“I had to spend my first years of
teaching in the training of students
to recognize facts; this generation
now knows the facts, but it is yet
learning to discover the general [In-
rlcrlying principles.”

 

When asked if he thought youth
of today worse than heretofore Prof.
Ward smiled and said, “No, that talk
is all tommyrot. Of course they’re
not." He feels that, even though the
world is too full of Bahbitts, this
condition will be improved if only a
few people of today will think,

He docs not feel that college is a
necessity to everyone, and pointed
out, "Just because a man has not
been to college is no reason to tag
him as uneducated.” Iri illustrating
his view he coutiniied, "Gandhi once
told me that, even though his mother
was illiterate, he had never considered
her an uneducated women, for in
spite of her lack of schooling, he
learned many thin from her.

“College depends largely upon thc
person,” the theologian Continued,
“Some people are aided by the train—
ing which a college course gives,
while others learn just as much by
mere living.”

Gates Speaker
F oresees Unity
in Communism

Fellowship Delegates Hear
Concluding Lecture

on Friday

“To have a rightly organized so-
ciety no class must dominate," de-
clared H. F, Ward, professor of Chris-
tian Ethics at Union Theological
seminary, in his second Gates Memor-
ial address on “The Emergence of
the Masses" this morning in Herrick
chapel. Mr. Ward said that this
could be accomplished only through
the abolition of all classes.

“Only as the peasants and the
workers come together can we se—
cure a functioning society," the
speaker declared, “and this thing is
taking place for the first time in
world history.” He pointed out that
in this forming movement of peas~
ants and workers a universal sense
of kinship grows between them.

Depends Upon Attitude

“It is not a case of ‘let us be one’,“
Mr. Ward explained, “but of ‘we are
one—one in our name, our thoughts,
and our powerl' Whether or not
these people succeed in defeating
their condition depends almost en»
tirely upon our attitude.

“The first directing force is com:
mllnisnl." he said. “It is the
spear point of the class upheaval
everywhere, and many American in—
tellectuals tend to depreciate it."‘

communism Gives Plan

This communism, Prof. Ward be-
lieves, gives the people a plan and a
purpose in life. "Instead of destroy-
ing the individual by mass movement,
as heretofore been done, he will be
developed,” he continued.

other forces which Mr. War-d
pointed out as responsible for the
direction of the movement are a
racial revolt and spiritual and educa-
tional forces. “We must be able," he
declared, “to take these personal in-
ter-ests and transmute them through
the universe for the good of society.

Tiirec Lectures Remain

"This situation," the speaker con»
cluded, ”needs a religion which will
put its sanction on the lower classes,
for talk of democracy means noth-
ing until knowing and doing are tied
together."

Futility of the Modern Temper,u
