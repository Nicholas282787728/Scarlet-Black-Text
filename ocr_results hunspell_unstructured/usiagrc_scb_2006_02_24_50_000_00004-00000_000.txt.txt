Old virgins, young wizards and trespassing MIWIHIMES

Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire (PG-13)

The latest Hairy Potter installment, Harry Pol/er
and [he Gal/e; a/‘Fiic, shows the power of thorough
Hollywood filmmaking. The film is full of exciting
segments, wellredited and shot, but ultimately the
decision to focus on fast-paced action and simple ex»
position rather than making the most out of the real
story means that, while exciting, it doesn't hit quite as
hard as it could.

For example, in the novel, Harry retrieves an egg
from the nest ofa chained-up dragon in a tournament.
In the film adaptation, the scene is set the same, but
instead of Harry managing to evade the dragon and
bring home the prize without too much drama, the
film's dragon manages to break its chains and pursue
Harry all over the Hogwarts grounds, from tower to
valley and even barreling through a rather formidable
stone bridge. At one point, Harry is barely hanging. on
by his fingers, one hand desperately reaching for his
broom, in a moment that owes more than a little to
the famous icescave of The Empire Sinker Back

Unlike the first two films, which strictly adhered
to the source material and had the unpleasant result
ofbcing entirely too dry and lifeless, this fourth film
takes the text and adds all sorts of Hollywood devices.
But with the addition ofa more Hollywood tone, the
series loses something as well.

In H1177 y Father and lie Prirwlel' afﬂzhnbml, rogu~
ish director Alfonso Cuaron introduced a new chil-
dren’s film aesthetic: mature and powerful, alluring
and mysterious. With Newell, the style has shifted
away from Cuaron’s artistry and towards simple
craftsmanship, offering less to the viewer’s imagina-
tion. Your mind simply doesn't have to work as hard
as in the third film.

While Harry Porter and the Goblet afFirr is not
quite an artistic triumph, it does have remarkably en—
rertaining character development. Newell seems to
have a knack for small, meaningful moments 7 little
cinematic clues that help us better understand the
players.

He's also an “actor's director."In the climax of the
film, Daniel Radcliffe displays a much wider emo—

tional range than in previous films. Rupert Grint and .

Emma Watson, playing Harry's best friends Ron and
Hermione, measure up as well. As is tradition, the role
of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor is taken
by yet another veteran British actor, this time Bren-
dan Gleeson in a total physical transformation.

Still, while the acting is admirable, the film doesn’t
quite fit together as cohesively as it could. Some

scenes are captivating. The climax of the third chair
lcngc is especially atmospheric, but the few cinemittie
gems do not quite satisfy the high standards set by the
previous Azlnhmi.

3-Iron (R)

wesrern cinema really ought to learn from eons
temporary Asian cinema.There aren’t many Western
films with deaths induced by golf balls, romances
without words and main characters that break into
homes to do chores,

In Korea’s J-Imh, written and directed by Kisduk
Kim, the protagonist ‘is mysterious, to say the least.
He remains silent for the duration of the film and
breaks into homes to repair malfunctioning property,
clean dishes, do laundry and make beds. Ofcourse, he
also indulges by "sleeping"in the owner’s bed (I’ll tell
you when you‘re older), preparing sumptuous Asian
cuisine, watching television and doing anything else
that strikes his fancy.

When his clever system of determining whether
his hosts are home fails, he befriends a woman who
resides' in one of the more afﬂuent homes he visits.
Her husband returns to find them, and the main char—
acter quixotically takes care of him with what I as-
sume to be a 3-iron.

His new comrade accompanies him to more house
es and becomes his sexy, silent apprentice. They keep
getting into more trouble, and the main character
perfects his crime to such an extent that he becomes
almost ghostslikeffhe woman returns to her husband
when the main character is incarcerated, but upon his
release, the three find an inreresring way to live ro-
gether in relative harmony.

The message of the fdm is difficult to ascertain,
but by the end of the film the main character and
his female companion begin to settle into their hosts’
homes even when the owners are around. Kitduk
Kim may be pleading for more amiable relationships
between people, particularly strangers, and the elimi-
nation of the enmity and antirsocial proclivities that
many people harbor. It is a convincing argument yet
difficult to embrace with the lack of dialogue, even
though that did not hinder rhe pacing of or themes
in the ﬁlm. Kisduk Kim's film surpasses and breaks
away from the four or so plots typical to western
cinema. The actions, pantomimes and interactions of
'the various characters rruly evoke their own iiirerpres
rations. The few subtitles are superfluous.

The 40 Year Old
Virgin

Frln 7-30 is. l0-30 p m

The 40 Year Old Virgin (R)

At firsr glance, T/ac 40 rm on Virgin is just aliolllt
er lame sex comedy, The formula is fairly strlllghtfots
ward: undersapptcciated guy, his mitnlysniim fiientls,
awkward relationships, good-looking women and lors
ofsex jokes. Despite this familiar formula, this movie
does what the others before it could not: stay funny all
the way (0 rhe end.

Director/writer Judd Apatow (Fr-ml: mid Gee/tr,
Under/arch is one of Hollywood's bcsr at creating
likeable characters, and he uses his talents to sell this
movie.

Moving beyond his memorable supporting roles,
such as BrickTainland inAnc/Jm‘mmi, Steve Carell has
stepped into the limelight. He plays Andy, an elec
tronics store employee who rides his bike to work,
wears really ugly shirts, watches Tv with his elderly
neighborsand who obviously hasn't managed to round
all ofthe bases in any of his relationships.

Andy's friends Jay (Romany Malco), Cal (Seth
Rogen) and David (Paul Rudd) become involved in
his sex life after he makes up a story about feeling a
woman’s breasts. They decide they are going to get
Andy a partner so that he can finally experience the
joy ofsex.

Unfortunately, none of the Andy‘s dates go very
well, ending in particularly hilarious situations. Andy
eventually goes offon his own and meets Trish (Cath-
erine Keener) and hopes that, by using his friends'ad-
vice, he can woo Trish into having Sex with him.

Andy’s friends play their stucksup, manly roles
very well and make use ofthe movie's R rating, spie-
ing up two hours of film with incredibly dirty, yet
funny conversations. Their “you-kiiowshowslsknowr
you'resgay” banter is a highlight and gives us more
reasons to laugh at stuff we probably shouldn't. (Be
wary, Grinnell fans of coldplay. You will have re once
again defend your taste in music.)

Unlike the summers other hit comedy, Wedding
Cmrhns, The 40 Year Old Virgin manages to maintain
its humor throughout the movie, something that most
comedies fail to do

In the end, the movie succeeds because of its
combination ofrapid-fire jokes and its feel-good, ro-
mantic comedy Geeky Andy garners rhe audience's
support and affection as he finally breaks free from
his life ofaction ﬁgures and video games at home. By
the time Andy gets deflowered,it's easy to iealize that
TI}: 40 Yer/1r Old Virgin is the best comedy of its kind
in recent memory
