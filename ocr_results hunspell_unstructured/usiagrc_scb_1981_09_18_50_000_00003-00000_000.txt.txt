Audubon works to oust Watt

Students sign petitions
outside Cowles and Quad

by Marty Merlotto

The Grinnell College Audubon Society
has joined a nationwide petition drive that
calls (or the ouster at US Interior
Secretary James Watt.

The Audubon action, taken on the behalf
of the National Sierra Club, was conducted
last week on the Grinnell college campus
According to Audubon's president, Jon
Binhammer, 560 signatures were collected
oulside Quad and Cowles Dining Halls.

The Sierra Club started its national drive
April 17 and has collected at least 750,000
signatures The aim of the environmenr
tallsts is to collect one million names, a
goal they hope to reach eimer at the end of
September or early October. To publicize
their cause. the petitions will be sent by the
truckload to the oliices ol LIS. senators and
representatives in Washington. no. ‘Wlth
such results as this," Binhaminer said.
”these petitions will lell the Congress that
the vast majority ot the American public
disapproves ol' Wall's conduct in office."

Grinnell‘s Audubon Soctety claims there
exists a conflict of interest between Watt's
business ties as president or the Mountain
States Legal Foundation. a Denver based
public-interest law tirm that specializes in
representing businessmen and taxpayers
in environmental court cases against the
tederal government and his ability to pro
perly carry out the interior Department's
duty to protect the nation's natural
resources

The Society cited a number or Watt's pro
posals they ielt underscored Watt's contlict
ol interest. These proposals include the In-
terior Secretary‘s decisions that no more
tederal parks be established, that the seabr
ed on the Calitornia coast be opened to oil
exploration, that off-road vehicles be given
increase use or tederal land, that oil and
gas production be permitted on wildlite
reiuges and Wilderness areas, that the pro
visions oi the Clean Air Act be relaxed and
that park concessionaries have more con»
trol over their National Parks

when asked whether environmental
groups have been too extreme and it Watt
only wants to “swing the pendulum back to
the center." as some of his supporters have
claimed, some or the members or Audubon
did agree that environmental groups as a
whole have been overly zealous. But
Binhammer noted that Watt has swung it
too tar in the other direction. He remarked,
"Once the land has been depletetd due to
Wall's actions, it will be those same
businesspeople who supported Watt that
will end up paying tor his actions "
Therefore. Audubon urges his removal
rrom the post of interior Secretary notonly
because of the threat he might pose to the
aesthetic value to the environment but also
because of the dangers he might pose for
the Us economy

Faculty retirement changes to take effect

Mandatory age to 70 tn July

by Anne Rawland

Although most Grinnell College faculty
members plan to continue working up to
the mandatory retirement age, said EXr
ecutive Vice President Waldo Walker,
some tind the rigors ot teaching too deman-
ding to remain in the classroom during the
last iew years 01 their tenure,

Soon this problem will be compounded by
the rise in the retirement age from 65 to 70
years, which is slated to occur in July of
1982. The U.S. Congress voted this change
during the 1977 congressional session.

But due to a program ﬁrst proposed by
Walker and approved by the Board of
Trustees during the i978-79 academic
years, protessors may stay with the college
even though they choose not to teach, The
college terms the plan the Partial Salary
Continuation Option,

Under the plan protessors may opt to
remove themselves from the classroom as
much as five years belore mandatory
retirement and still 'receive 47'percent or
their salary along with all of their beneﬁts,
A protessor who chooses this route remains
on the roll of faculty members, He also re-
tains rights to ottice space and college
tacilitics and research endeavors.

With the rise in the retirement age pro-
iessors will be forced to wait longer before
they can take part in the partial salary ops
tion. However, because at" the change the
college will probably offer more money to
non-teaching pruiessors, according to
Walker.

since the college pays a professor less
while he participates in the option, Grinnell
uses the excess timds to hire new iaculty.

The policy on the use at the Forum's
private dining rooms (PDRS? has caused
much contusion among students this year.
According to Jenny Erikson, director of the
Forum. the policy on the use at the Pond
remains unchanged for campus organiza
tions and all other student and faculty
groups

"Any group can reserve a dining room
in a spc ' ic night throughout the entire
semester," explained Erikson, "However.
this year we will not be catering meals

“Some schools make money on their
plans,” said Walker, “but we’re not trying
to make money on this."

Presently the college must continue to
contribute to percent or a protessor's in-
come to the college‘s retirement iund agen-
cy, Teacher's insurance Anui'ty Associa
tion (TIAA), even if the professor chooses
the partial option. But because all or the
TIAA tables reﬂect a 65 year old retirement
age, federal law will not require institu-
tions to (Rmtribute to social security when
the age jumps to 70. Thus. said Walker,
“Since we don’t have to pay TIAA we can
contribute more than 47 percent."

Currently only tour protessors take part
in the partial salary option. Regardless oi
the ottictal age change, those faculty
members will be allowed to continue until

in waves," said Walker. “There could easi»
ly be a fiveryear period when there would
be none.”

According to Walker, besides the current
program, “We are considering backing it
(the option) ott to seven years" in order to
help protessors caught in the transition
crunch.

Prior to the partial option idea institu-
tions allowed faculty members to retire
