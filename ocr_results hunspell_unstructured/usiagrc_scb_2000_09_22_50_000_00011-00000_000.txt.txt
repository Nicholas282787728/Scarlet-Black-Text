from Nebraska. rhere are a grand roral orrhiee
things in life I really love: beef, eorn and eollege

College arhleries is a very speeial rhing re
any Nehraskan. Living in a srare where the clos-
est thing re a professional sports ream is

11': no surprise, rlien,
rhar we Nebraskans
love the traditions
rhar come along
with our college

_ most as much as life itself. The Nehrnslra
Cornliuskers are surrounded by more rradnions
rhan a cob has kernels; rhe Tunnel Walk, the
Scaochd, rhe Consranrwmning oiNauenal

Coming from a srare wirh all more rollege
sporring rradnions, l have the almosr.mysrieal
gift ofknowing whar makes a good rridirion,
wirh rhar in mind, I’d like to humialy offer a
row suggesriens otrradirions we need ro lnsti»
riirr ar crinnell.

First, we need an aerunl maseor to attend
home sporting events As far as college nick»
niinaes go, we have n prerry cool one (Pioneers)

two halls, norstri kes

and we should have an equally cool maseor.
I’ve ncvcr seen a realelire pioneer bcforc, and
frankly l have no idea whar your rypieal pio»
neer would look like. That’s why I rhink we
should serap rhe mundane lireral mascots run.

speaking or mascots, we also need a con-
venienr hand signal we can flash ro symbolize
all ihar is rhe Pioneers a la rhe “Hook 'Em
l—lorns" orTexas. I've been working on
the “Pioneer Cov-
ered wagon,” our
the elosesr l've gore
ren is a cross bee
tween a sign language “o“ and ivhar l'rn prerry
sure is a gang sign. Since i don’t want to ineire
rurfwars during soeeer games, I‘ll keep wnrke
rug on this one and ler you know what i come
up ivirh.
lusr heeause we don’r have a rangihle mas»
eor or nifry hand sign, though, doesn'r mean
orinnell sporring rradirions don’t exisr. ’I'hc
eross eounrry ream alone has enough rradirions
For three or four Grinnells. My tavorrre orrlie
crass eounrry traditions is a lirrle somerhing
ealled rhe Nukcd Mile. As rhe name would
imply, this is where various members of rho
ream snip down and run a mile in norhing

nithnlusjohnsorr

but rhe singler rhey were born in.

The Naked Mile is so great, I rhink we need
to extend ir r'o orher sports. For insranee, our
haselsall and softball reams eould rake naked
barring praeriee. lnsread orhaving a no.pads
workour, foorhall eould have a mommies
workour. And while in all for naked layup
drills lay rhe haskerlaall reams, I really rhink rhe
swimming and diving squads should sray away
from [ills particular rradirion (we see rhem
naked enough as ir is).

But why should our sporrs reams srop ar
stealing rradirions from other varsity squads?
Nor only do eluh sporrs or Grinnell have a lor
to ofrer as is, but rhey also have some ofrhe
hesr readiriisns rhis side orPark sr. After rughy
marches, rorerample, it’s good rughyeriquerre
for the home reani ro provide food and beer
