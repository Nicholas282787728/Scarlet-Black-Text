THE PRESENTATION of "As You
Like It” Friday evening, was an
unqualiﬁed success, and one which
reﬂects the highest credit to the
class of '99 and to Miss Glenna
Smith, who has trained them.
The Seniors have certainly proved
that such an innovation on the
regular Class Day exercises is not
out oi place occasionally, and
this pertormance will go down to
history as lully on a par with any
which preceded it.

THE ACHIEVEMENTS of the ball
team this year have attorded great
satisfaction to the student body in
general,especiallythevictory over
Cornell, which had been agoal un-
attained for the two years prevr-
ous. Throughout the season the
team has played clean, lrard ball.
and only praise is due them tor
bringing the silver bat back to
Grinneil again. In other years it
has seemed impossible to prevent
Iowa College trom securing at
least one state championship in
some branch of athletics, it not
more, and the work ol the ball
team during the past season has
kept this precedent horn being
intringed.

As THE present senior editors of
SCARLET AND BLACK drop the cdir
torial pen and leave the retreat
which has grown somewhat home
like to them, they do so with the
feeling that they leave behind
them a staff of editors tor next
year who are capable of making
SCARLET AND BLACK far better
than it has been the past year.
Mr. A. L. Frtshie, who has shared
to a great extent in the labor con-
nected wrtli the paper the past
year, has shown himself unusually
capable, and as managing editor
for the coming ye r, will without
doubt handle the paper in a way
whieh will be acceptable to all
SCARLET AND BLACK readers,
With Messr- Crandall, Whitley
and Eldredge as associate editors,
Mr. Fr bie has a strong band or
helpers who have it in their power
to make next year an unusually
successful one (or SCARI AND
BLACK, The present management
has olrly the best w hes tor-the
new staff oi editors in their next
years work.

The Baseball Season

The game Thursday with Iowa
Cityclosed the season for the Grlnr
nell base ball team, winning the
silver bat and with it the undisput-
ed right to the slate Championr
strip. Tire team is deserving of
great credit {or their season's
work. Unable on account of bad
weather to get any regular pine
tree until after the spring was well
advanced, and srrtierrng the loss
of some good material, they have,
in spite of difﬁculties, played out
the most successful season that
Grlnnell ever played.

They have won every League
game, dcleating Ames, Cornell,
and so. 1., in turn, losing butone
exhibition game, and that merely
one out of a series of three with
Monmouth. and at the close of a
hald trip.

The individual work of the team
needs no praise here, as all know
that every man has played his po—
sition well, and that all were well
placed as to their positions.

Our pitchers have been strong
and their record for‘ the season
good, with perhaps the glaring
exception of the game Thursday.

Taft has played asplendrd game
all season behind tlle bat, having
let but few balls pass him,

Tire ﬁelding oi the wliole'team
has been fast. and inﬁelders and
outﬁelders are equally deserving
of due credit for the team's slic-
cess.

In Thursday's game Clark did
especially brilliant work in gather-
ing in everything that came his
way, and in rapid base throwing.

The management of the team
has been as successful as the uork
oi the lt:.irii
