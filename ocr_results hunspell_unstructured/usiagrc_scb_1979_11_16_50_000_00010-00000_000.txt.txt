Dispelling myths; tracking down abuse

by Missy Bowen

Dale Hawn doesn’t think students
are giving his organization a fair
chance when criticizing physical‘ plant
operations. Students and other
members of the campus community
often charge that BSLG employees are
lazy and inefficient, that the quality of
the work performed is low, and that
decisions on projects are rendered ar-
bitrarily and without regard to
aesthetic taste.

.Hawn, director of the physical plant,
lays the blame for this attitude on
poor communication.

Some oi the complaints about B&G
center on the renovations and alterar
tions to buildings. Hawn has come
under fire recently for such things as
painting the redwood on the library
addition to the Science Building and
the external design of Macy House. In
both cases, says Hawn, there is sound
reasoning behind the decisions

According to Hawn, paint is the only
redwood coating that can withstand
the temperature extremes of Iowa’s
climate. The design of the renovated
Macy House was influenced by a come
Initiation of factors which left little
room to maintain the aesthetic
qualities of the building. These iactors
included a need for large amounts of
office space and the fact that the
building had been renovated on two
‘previous occasions.

Most complaints about the physical

plant center around general campus
'm' intenance and employee efficiency.
This is another communication pro~
blem, says Hawn.

The administration is generally
satisfied with the physical plant,
although both President Drake and
Dean Walker expressed dissatisfaction
with campus appearance. Drake, who
recently took a walking tour of came
pus with Hawn, was pleased by what
he saw. hut thinks “we can do a better
job on the buildings.”

Walker agreed. “The upkeep could
he better," he stated, “But part oi
that is the fault of the administra
tion.” He was referring to the college
policy which restricts the use of her-
bicides and pesticides on campus
grounds,

Despite contradictions irom Hawn,
most students and some BSLG
employees see the organization as be
ing inefficient, and some workers as
being “lazy. but nice." '

Several present and tormer
emphyees agree that this observsar
tion is correct, and that a “don't work
too hard" policy is in effect among
B&G workers One iormer employee
recalled bang on the Job only a few
days when he was told by a superior
to not work so hard. “The guy told me
to take it easy,\’ he said.

The same Worker cited incidents
when workers fell asleep on the job for
extended periods oi time, and when a
group of summer employees would
just “sit around for the afternoon,”

Hawn feels students and others do
not perceive the situation correctly,
Some work shiits are staggeredithey
begin and end at odd hours. Therefore,
said Hawn, What students see as an

extended 15»minute break could be, in
fact, that worker’s lunch hour.

Although the wages at the lower end
of the pay scale are about equal to or
higher than those at Cornell and Knox,
wages at local factories run as much
as $3.20 an hour higher Walker stated
that the pay scale is counteracted by
the fringe benefits that accompany the
job. ,

Such benefits include full health in-
surance and free tuition for children of
employees. Walker admitted that an
additional fringe benefit is the
“pleasant working atmosphere,”

Denying the existence of a “work at >
leisure” policy, Hawn said, ”if we are
informed of an apparent waste of
time, we will act on it.”

Similar differences of opinion exist
on the issue of overtime. Workers cite
cases where work was done slowly
throughout the job, therehy creating a
need for overtime work.

Hawn stated that overtime is often
necessary, especially in the summer
when the work schedule is heavvi

Walker said that the amount of
money spent on overtime is not “in
any way excessive.” and has not ex»
ceeded the amount budgeted.

Overall, Hawn felt the physical
plant situation can be improved. “I’ll
be the first to admit that there’s
always room for improvement," he
said. Hawn, Walker and Browning
asserted that an upgrading of the
quality of work would require increas»
ed spendingia near impossibility as
inflation continues to have its effect on
the budget.

F . . . '
(Mummers already eyeing nationals

, by Rob Eldon
,’ ‘,Year after year, mens swimming is
' one of the most successful sports at

Grinnell. Last year, the swimmers
were the only men's team on campus
.to Win a Conference title, Coach Ray
Obermiller says. “I'd be very surpris-
ed it we don't win conference this this
year," Obermiller feels that at this
point in the season, his team is in bet-
ter shape than any other team he has
coached at Grinnell.

Captains Grc Gomez and Brian
Jones seem to s are this feeling.
Gomez says, “The team has a lot of
depth; people are working harder."

The swimmers host the Pioneer
Relays on Monday evening. They ex
pact to win. Then, on Tuesday after-
noon, the team will engage in a three
way meet with Creighton and william
Jewell, As one swimmer put it, “No
problem!"

Obermillcr cites the loss of his three
captains who graduated last spring as
the biggest difference irom last year:
Bruce Jones (no relation to Brian)
was a nine time conference champion
in various events. Frank Halley was a
seven time champ, ”But the ir-
retrievable loss," said Obermiller,
“was, of course, Zimmerman.”

Norm Zimmerman won the Division
III national title in Semeter diving.
Zimmerman is often considered one of
the best athletes in Grinncl’s history.

Qbermiller feels that although he
has lost some good swimmers. the in»
ilow oi freshmen will help compenr
sate. He cites Paul Tcrini as a strong
distance swimmer, Hugh Deaner, a
middle distance freestyler. and Ben~
nett Lasko and Chuck Platz, both of
whom are sprinters.

Obermiller feels the team will be a

little weaker in diving, compared to
some previous years when Grinnell
diving went unthreatened, Obermiller
will rely on Tom Helpenstell, a two
time allnAmerican, lielpenslcll and
Zimmerman usually shared first and
second place at meets last year.

As for the returning swimmers,
Jones and Gomez are defending con-
ference champions. as are Brian Ross,
Rick stuck, Marty Baughman, Warren
Schultz, and Bruce Pivar.

Already, some of the swimmers’
times qualify for nationals. Obermlller
expects many of his swimmers will go
on to nationals, and that most school
records will be broken, as well as
many conference records.

Like last year, the t in will do
most of its serious training in Houston,
during the last two weeks of semester
recess.
