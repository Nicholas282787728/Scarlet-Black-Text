HE victory oi last. week has
brought to light Several Candis

Lions which are both new and strange
to Iowa Collette students of the pres-
cut generation. SCAILLET .lxn Br._icir
merely wishes to sound a note or
warning in both cases Coach Bergen
sounded the keynote oi the Grinnell
spirit when he Sliid ”Cheer for the
team and not [or the individualist Tile
team is what counts, not the playing
of this man Or of that one.” Our
friend the Senator emphasized the
same point when he modestly said
the other morning, “Blenmdster (lid
not make the touchdown, It was the
whole Grinnell team.” There is a.
wealth of wisdom in both statements.
Support the team but do not become
egotistical in your enthusiasm. The
state championship is not won by any
means, the battle has hardly begun.

The second point is that Iowa Col~
lege at Grinnell has had the reputa-
Lion in the past of being represented
by teams who were composed of play-
ers who had the best interests of the
college at heart. It was said of one
team that every member could lead a
prayer meeting just as well ashe could
play footballr That fact IS ilnmztterr
ial to us and we mention it merely as
(Ln incident. However, it is reported
on good authority that certain Grin-
nell players could he heard to use pro»
ianity :colltilluzillyj throughout Sat-
urday's game by the people on the
bleachers.

Now, profanity may be necessary to
relieve one‘s feelings now and thou,
but surely it is 11 waste Of energy. We
are Well aware Oi the fact that it man
is not always responsible for what he
does or says ina ioorball game, and yet
we feel sure that football crinbe played
and is played without the generous use
of Oaths. We do not wish it) criticize
too harshly; our only aim |S to call
the attention of the players to an un-
fortunate condition of alltii‘s, We
wish them to reﬁll/e that when It mun

A Few Remarks;

Wise and Otherwise.
By the Ediror

“Sting 'em." Well, 1 guess Vie did.

The “I-told-yourso" people are not
very much in evidence this Week ant-i
we guess that Mike is [he only one
who has the rightio use the expres-
sion and he has l'eh'ﬂinetl out olsyin-
pathy for liouilaw, we expect.

It is reported that our genial i‘riend,
Dr. llomlaw cussed and prcaned all
the way down town ill a manner
which would do ii lee to a-lientucky
Colonel. Too ba “not, but, “Cheer
up, it mighthai-e been worse," as Mr.
Bogus used to say.

“Bumping the Bump ’(s)” may be
great sportill the White city but it
is not what it is cracked up to be in
Grinnell. r. s. The editor can give
a written testimonial to this ell‘ect. if
necessary.

Saturday’s victory was hard on our
friends, Tracy Garrett of the Register
and n K. Steere of Iowa city but they
have succumbed gracefully and conde-
sceuded to give us a fairly decent
write up, They can’tlorget, however,
that Dralre is still in the game.

Beiore the season is over, some or
our Dralre friends may come to the
conclusion that the greatest. thing
about Heston is his salary. Norahi
It is not the biggest frog who jumps
the longest distance or the greatest
player who makes the best coach.

The poem which appears on the first
page is certainly a good one and is one
ol the cleverest production which has
come to our notice for some time. Tile
unknown author deserves a leather
medal.

“Sting ’ein," has become a favorite
phrase in Grinnell and Mr. Barnard at
Philadelphia has made himself famous
in a single night.

We are moved to remark that those
selrsaoridciug professors of Cornell
have certainly lived up to their repu»
tatiou. At a recent Freshmen party,
every member of the faculty horn the
venerable president down to the jani-
tor alIorded police protection Lo the
“Fresllies” and faced a regular shower
of vegetables and eggs, and even
rished their own sl:il:ls,lloo to inentiou
their reputations in a llltlldrto-hand
conlliet with the indignant Sopho-
mores,
