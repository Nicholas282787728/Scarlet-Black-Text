During his lecture Tuesday
night, Jafri gave a brict his»
torieal, political and economic
survey of his country. Pakistan
is, he explained, an exceedingly
young nation. It was created
in August of 1947. upon the
r withdrawal oi the British irom
India, by the Moslem peoples
who had been dominated polit-
ically and economically by the
more numerous i-Iindus. The
two religions being basically
antagonistic, the Moslenis torm—
ed a state ot their own in north»
ern India—Pakistan.

Pakistan is divided into two
parts, East and West, West
Pakistan is the larger in area,
being about the size oi the
state uf Iowa East Pakistan.
though it is but 1/6 the sire
oi West Pakistin, is the
greater in population. The
population or the entire coun:
try, both East and West, is
20,000,000, making it the sixth
largcst in the world, and the
largest oi the Moslcm nationst

“From its very birth, Pakistan
has faced grave dangers from
the outside, especially from
India,” continued Jatri. One ot
these dangers is the Kashmir
dispute, This dispute began in
1947 with the partition. Kashmir
was one of the princely states
of India which enjoyed certain
autonomy under British rule. It

was allowed to keep its own
ruler who in turn had a great

Though the majority or the
people in Kashmir are Mos—
lcm tahouttin%) the Mahdi“ 'ah
“'25 Hindu, “'hcu the BI l
Irccd India in 1947, the Mos-
leins within Kashmir began to
agitate to join Pakistan, The
Hindu niaharajah rearing revo-
lution, called on India tor
help, Artcr signing a treaty
with the hiaharaja, the Indian
government promptly new
troops into Kashmir. where—
upon Pakistan rushed troops
to ‘Kasllmir to support the
cause or the Mosloins,

Fighting broke out and con—
tinued until 1949 when thc
United Nations Security Council
intervened at the request or
lndia and ordered a cease fire.
It was decided to hold a gen»
erai election within Kashmir
and abide by the will ot the
majority oi the pcoplc, as to
which country Kashmir would
join. However, indie refused to
remove her troops from the ter-
ritory when the elections were
to take place.

Pakistan immediately protest-
ed that the elections would be
uniair it Indian troops should
he allowed to remain. H0w~
over, India still reiused to re—
move her torecs and no clcc.
tion was held At the present
moment Pakistan holds at»

India possessing the remain-
ing portion

Pakistan's two greatest prob-
lems, however, are economic and
educational. Pakistan is unable
to raise enough tood to support
her enormous population and
consequently huge amounts of
inoncy'must be spent in import.
ing food from other nations that
could be spent as industrial
capital and for nation building
projects. Currently there is not

under cultivation,
or an adequate irrigation sys-
tem Foreign aid is helping to
combat tius problem but it is
far Ironi enough.

Pakistan’s second big prob-
lem is i, illiteracy. Eighty,
per cent at its people can
neither read nor writer To
combat this problem Polristan
is building new schools and
educating teachers needed to
start thcmt

Jatri pointed out that because
at those pressing problems at an
undcrdevclopcd nation, Pakis—
tan's major foreign policy must
be primarily one ot self-interest.
Howcvc, he stated that it was
the aim at Pakistan to “pro-
mote peace in accordance with
the United Nations chartert
There is at present a feeling
of tricndship between the Unit
ed States and Pakistan We hope
that it continues to exist tar
into the iuture,"

In other areas, Jairi com-
mented on his country's posi-
tion concerning Israel, ltcd
China, and the united Arab
Itcpublic.

viewpoint, the creation or Israel
