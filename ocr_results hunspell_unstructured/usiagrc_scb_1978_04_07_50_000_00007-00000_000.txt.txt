Expansion

by Tin! DcCoster

The Scarlet and Black baseball
team has returned from spring
training camp with high hopes for
a successful 1978 campaign, The
squad worked out at Ranger Junior
College, whose motto is “Winning
is our tradition."

Ranger, a “Juco” run by the
Philadelphia Phillies, is powerful
in football, basketball and track as
well as baseball.

Grinnell's presence in Texas
added fire to recent rumors that
the National League, anticipating
expansion in 1980, intends to tab
the Pioneers in order to draw fans
from the upper Midwest,

The National League is expected
to place Harvard in the expanded
Eastern Division. Grinnell, in its
“Go West" tradition, will be placed
in the Western Division with such
powerhouses as Cincinnati, Los
Angeles, and San Diego.

while instant success cannot be
expected for the Pioneers in the
big-leagues, a few good trades
Could land Grinnell in the World
Series by 1934. And what a scene
that will be.

Grinnell in 1984

In 1984 John Martinek, veteran
manager in the league as a result
of deaths and firings of other
managers, will lead his team into
the playoffs after a tight race with
lhe Giants Their foes will be the
Chicago Cubs, who won an in-
credible 143 games, thanks
primarily to their acquisition of
free agent umpire. Shag-
Crawford.

A senior transfer student from
the University of Cincinnati, Joe
Morgan, will provide the offensive
punch for Grinnell, driving them
over the Cubs three games to two.
“Bring on the Yankees!" Cry the
elated Iowa fans,

The filst two games of the Series
are won by the Yankees in New
York before 70,000 screaming fans.
Back in the friendly confines of
Stadiums Unlimited’s Pioneer
Park, Grinnell takes the next three
games before 50 witnesses, then
wins the sixth game in Yankee
Stadium to take the Series! Un-
doubtedly the birth of a dynasty.

Grapefruit League
Ranger Junior College proves to be
too tough of a match for Grinnell

by Dick Gilbert

During spring break, just like
their major league counterparts,
the Pioneer baseball team had
their own version of spring
training

Traveling to the Texas resort
town of Ranger, the Pioneers
played against a team as talented
as any they’ll face all season,
Ranger Junior College

RJC. a school where 95 per cent
of the students participate in Ins
tercollegiate sports and where the
library frequently closes at 5 p m.
while the weight room stays open
all nigllt. defeated Grinnell in all
live games in three days. Seeing as
how RJC has been practicing since
September, the losses should come
as no surprise

However. the Pioneers had many
superb performances 'against a
team loaded with potential pros
(four or five, in fact, have been
drafted by major league teams).
Joe Nixon and Joe “Mellow”
Mclinger led the hit parade with
six and four hits, respectively,

“Sweet" Fete Nlerman and Ross
”the Boss" Jacobsen each slame
med homers while Melinger, Bill
Pickett, and Jeff Lindholm had
ringing doubles. Scott Adams and
Dave Green were also hot hitters
with three solid Singles apiece.

With the exception of a few
pitches, the mound staff threw
quite well. Kevin Starrett, Bob
Meyer. and Dave “Juan“ Wick all
held the Rangers scoreless for
innings at a time. Chris "Sultan of
Swat" Sodoma and Nicrman were
finally able to turn loose their
powerful arms Jim “Gibby”
Gilbert and Dave “Buffer" Schultz
along \\ ith Pickett were behind the
plate calling the signals

Ken Bloom. Steve Bnlesta. Dave
Dunning. and Charlie Gogel per-
formed well with their fine alle
around play.

Thus. the Pioneers broke their
Texas camp in good spirits.
Although they left winless, they
gained much needed practice and

Big turnout gives Grinnell
depth for Central meet

by Tim DeCoster

The men‘s and women's track
teams open their outdoor seasons
tomorrow as both travel to Pella
for the Central College In»
vitational,

Coach Kit Wall will have a large,
young squad at her disposal in
taking on the strong teams that will
be competing at Central. Most of
the women running for Grinnell at
Pella were members of the indoor
track team.

An impressive number of women
have shown up for practices this
week, an occurrence which
delights any coach, The so runners
should give Wall‘s team
substantial depth. Depth, an im-
portant factor in any team sport, is
something which until recently
Grinnell women's sports have been
lacking.

Following the Central In»
Vitational, Wall's forces will travel
to Oskaloosa for Wednesday's
William Penn Invitational. Next
Saturday Graceland will host their
invitational meet in Lamoni.

Stars of the indoor team who will
be competing in outdoor track
include sprinters Harriet Phinney,
Loralee Newman, and Mary Jo
LaDu and distance runners Julia
Carver and Toni Heiman.

Coach John Pfitsch, having
added few “field men" to his
squad, will be trying to revive the
men‘s team following a rather
disappointing indoor finale The
Pioneers placed eighth at the
Conference meet in Chicago,which
was held before break.

 

Pacing the Grinnell scoring will
be triple and long jumper Tony
Whitaker. Whitaker, who placed
second in the indoor conference
triple jump this spring, jumped a
PEC record of 43' 9" late in the
indoor season,

Another consistent competitor
for the Pioneers Should be Kelly
Hanick, who placed fourth in the
conference EDD-yard dash. Hanick
also participated in a fourth place
mileerelay effort at the conference
meet,

The mile-relay team, which
provided many exciting finishes to
the indoor meets, is expected to
again be in contention for places
duringthe outdoor season. A1529 is
gone from the relay squad, but
Mark Bowman, Tim DeCoster. and
Hanick remain. Pfitsch will have
to search through his ranks to
come up with another quarter
miter for the relay team.

The Central meet will be an
important one for Plitsch to gauge
his team's conditioning. Witha
short season ahead, the hope is that
the two weeks of break did not
cause any of the runners to lose
their peak conditioning,

The distance runners carried
over from a Successful cross
country Season should prOVe ‘2
be another bright spot for the track
squad. Although the performances
of Dick Gilbert, Kevin Key, and_
Roger Sayre, were below par
during me indoor season, their
week long training in Ranger,
Texas should pay off.
