Rugby:

Women looking for new name,
but having no trouble finding

By Mali Lorenz

What is the mysterious allure
ofrugby? i talked to several mem—
bers orthe Grinnell women's rugby
team, and, though some of them
had been intending to give rugby
a try before they even got to
Grinnell, they had a hard time
putting its appeal into words.

Dcll McLaughlin ’02 thinks it
may be due to the fact that rugby
is “an unusual sport to American
audiences" and a “good way to get
out aggression,"

Meghan O’Connell '01 said, “1
think I was intrigued by the physi—
cality. You're in direct competition
with other people-and you have to
push yourseltand work with both
teams so no one gets iniured.”

Rugby is a very accessible sport
at Grinncll, which is part of its at»
trJCtion, According to O’Connell,
“A’ game is a learning experience.
You never blame anyone’for doing
anythingwrong,” One can join Lhc

Somcwl'tat like football, rugby
entails dodging tackles and pass—
ing to get the ball to your team's
endzone. But in rugby play is con»
tinuous, and a scott, worth ﬁve
pointers called a “try," Also, the
ball can only be passed backwards.

‘Thcrt: doesn’t seem to be offen-
sivc blocking involved like in foot-
ball; instead, according to
McLaughlin, "lryou have the ball,
you’re the center of attention for
everyone who wants to purnrnell
you to tha’ground.” No pads are
worn, either.

probably the weirdest looking
aspect of rugby ts rhe scrum,
when teammateslatch onto each
