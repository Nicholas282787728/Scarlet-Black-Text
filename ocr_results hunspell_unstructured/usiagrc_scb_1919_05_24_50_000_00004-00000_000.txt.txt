"The ﬁnest buildings of their 111ml 111 the United States," said BXrPresidenL Taft
after seeing the mall’s dormitories and women's quadrangle during his Visit to Gl‘ll'll'lell
'last year. '

The six buildings, now complete, form one side of it [imposed quadrangle to contain
sixteen buildings when ﬁnished. In ehtolilal zlpllczllzlnco they resemble the English
cottage time and symbolize Something of the t'pll'it at hospitality and good fellowship
which is within.

A long open Cloister lims the length of llli‘ Tlulldulgs on the east side. This binds
the Sixnnits together into the one dall'luinll 11ml. Building spirit is encouraged but
this is absorbed in the larger Grlnuell SDlIit.

No expense has been spared to “lake the dolmitories the best ill each particular.
The most advanced type of m-eoroot construction has been employed. Furniture is at
the best and of ample quantity. Hot and cold lullnlng Water in every bed room is a
‘ luxury which men letul'ning {1 am the almy particularly appreciate

a communit- 1111: 101 11 omen has been built up uhich assuics them a huge place in

.the college life.

The present group consists or ﬁve cottages which also arc the nucleus for a future

quadrangle. A ccnual cottage includes a spacious dining~ room which shots the four
hundred girls of the college.
' Herc also a close community spirit is encouraged both within the cottages them~
selves and the Quadrangle as a whole, The Quadrangle boasts all at the advantages
of the dormitories m matters of constructlon and equipment with some additions. The
"club rooms” hcrc become "parlors" buti the spirit or the rooms is the same. Each
cottage claims a kitchenette which serves as headquarters for spreads and lunches or
all descriptions.

Hendricksun, the elongated Simpson

three points.

The high jump will hc a pretty hat-

of Amos, 'and Stock. All three men
have jumped close to the record, 5
feet 11 inches, and the winner may
have to go over this. stock is better
this year than ever, and may will out
over the other two men, He is at
least assured of two. points. The

Paige and vinscl, w'lﬂi the odds favor-

both jump close to 21 tect, and this
should insure them a. few points. '
