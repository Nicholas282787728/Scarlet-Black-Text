. Is time running out
for the Grinnell , ’
media?

The media are dying a slow death at Grinnell, ‘

The symptoms are everywhere — the difficulty of filling editorial posi-
tions for the S&B, the scramble to find a yearbook editor for the 1983
Cyclone, the delays in increasing the wattage of KDIC, and its high in—
cidence of record theft.

Surprising occurences at what is supposedly one of the most pro-
gressive liberal arts colleges in the Midwest, possibly the country.

Where does the problem lie you ask?

The problemlies partly in me administration’s and faculty’s apparent
lack of concern and disregard for the students’ efforts. This disregard
becomes evident when you look at the shoddy facilities and equipment
that students must use, the lack of financial sup ort thus far, and the
absence of faculty advisors for these extracurric ar activities, which in
part prevents media workers from receiving any academic credit.

You would think a college which just declared its desire for develop-
ment “in the skills of i i . critical thought . . . and communication”
(President’s Ideas) would help foster this valuable means of acquiring
such skills outside the classroom.

Further, media which maintain high standards are an effective and
excellent way of reaching the campus, the town and other colleges.

The fault does not lie solely with the administration, for disregard and
disrespect is also apparent in the students’ attitudes.

Many students too readily criticize and condemn all three mediums
after just a cursory appraisal, forgetting that they are regarding me
work of their peers. ‘

If students respected the media, they would not steal records from
KDIC, thus impairing its ability to function and creating unnecessary
expenses.

It students respected the media, they would care about the quality of
their paper, participate in its production and look at more than just the
persona 5.

If. students respected the media, they themselves would help it
achievea postion of importance interms of academic credit and
recognition equal to that of other extracurricular activities.

Does a solution exist?

Possibly, but only if fundamental changes occur in the attitudes of the
campus population and the administration, and in the policies the latter

chooses to enact.

' A Eulogy

I was going to write about an issue I
thought was important. Suddenly, 'it
wasn’t. Saturday night a man was killed in
a tragic automobile accident. He worked
for the college and was on his way to work.

I knew this man, not well, but I often
talked with him, He was always helpful to
students — I think he truly cared about
people. Although his death won't make na
tional headlines, it shook me up more than
daily tragedies do. i am no longer concerns
ed with me issues that normally upset me
a not classes, not people a nothing i
might, however, be back to normal before
this is printed. That makes It even worse.

He was a good man, an often torgotten
virtue. He always took the time to say
hello, to ask how I was, to smile. He was a
kind man on occasions when i needed
help, he went out or his way to assis't me.
Rare qualities indeed.

I wonder what he thought as he watched
students pulling their hair out during finals
weeks. One could easily have seen us as
young idiots, wasting our time on

trivialities. He probably just tried to he]
out That was his manner.

What about watching us inhale absur
quantities of alcohol and drugs at parties
Did he condemn us tor destroying our live

Reflections on Campaign '8

Already the election has begun to fade
into the obscurity or your minds as the
Thanksgiving season passes and the specs
tie Oi finals and the end of the semester ape
preaches. The bombardment of campaign
ads, constant news coverage and in—depth
analysis by political commentators and
writers, including myselt, has been ops

lightheartednews detailing the more pleas
sant aspects of the Grinnell experience. I
promise this to be my last analysis of the
election year, unless sent on assignment
by my editors atter something they con-
sider to be newsworthy to all Grinnell
students.

What crinnell students accomplished on
election day was a mayor earuiouake,
whose shattering reverberations‘still
sound across the politcial landscape or
Poweshiek County and the whole or iowa,
with the epicenter in Grinnell’s lirst ward,
home oi Grinnell College. Grinnell
students voting in the numbers that they
did was largely responsible tor the re
election oi State Representative Janet
Carl and State Senator Joe Brown.

Indeed, because of the extremely heavy
turnout, the college represents a new, ma-
jor voting block that will lundamentally
change the political makeup of the county
and the state legislative districts that en
compass it, The conservative establish»
ment was badly trightened, fearing what I
believe to be a lasting change in the type of
representation the Grinnell area will
receive for the remainder of the decade
and perhaps beyond The college has
always enjoyed the reputation of being
politically liberal, but now it has become
known as the “Liberal Place that Votes,”
making itself heard through the represen-
tatives it sends to Des Moines and
Washington. It has become clear that Con—
gressman. Cooper Evans, no liberal, has

moderated his stands. on the issues from .

Bra

his freshmen term in Congress as coattai
beneficiary of the Reagan landslide.

Already those who seem offended b
your voting in the numbers that you di
have come forth to mount an assault 0
your right to vote in iowa. Just after th
Votes were counted in Janet Carl’s race
giving her a slim 49 vote margin out 0
over 11,000 votes cast, her opponent
Representative Phil Tyrrell (R-Nort
English), called for a recount and an in
vestigation into the possibility that som.
Grinnell students may have voted twice
once in their home district and once i
Grinnell.

Tyrrell, a member or the “Dirt,
Thirty", an ultra»conservative delegatio
of Republicans in the Iowa House whi
withheld their block of votes on key issue
in order to coerce the more moderat
Republicans into backing their legislativ
priorities, began immediately alter th
election to churn out press releases claim
ing that Grinnell students thwarted th
will or the district in his race because the
have no real interest in the issues or low
and, hence, should not have voted in it
elections, "

W.D, Best of North English, c
Republican and Tyrrell backer. com
mented in the Grinnell Herald-Regisle
that itwas "almostunbelievable thatnear
1y too students, most of whom don’t evei
live in iowa. can decide who is going it
represent the 53rd House district in lh
Iowa Legislature. These students lor th
most part assume no obligations to low
and don't even remain in Iowa.“

W,D Best's comments are shallow an-
partisan. Grinnell students spend nin
months of the year in iowa, they pay tui
tion to attend an iowa college, and they
work in the community as productiv
citizens, It would be ludicrous to think the
Grinnell students’ lives are not effected b)
the laws passed in the Iowa Legislature. I
smacks of intolerance that some propos
students should not be allowed to par-
ticipate in the election of the place wher-
they really do reside.
