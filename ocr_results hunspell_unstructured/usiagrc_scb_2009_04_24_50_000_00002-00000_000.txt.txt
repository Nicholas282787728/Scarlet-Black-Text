Money from Mays

BYJA] GARG

Grinnell College received a £500,000 fouryeal‘ grant
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation this year to help
initiate the Mellon Mays Undcrgtaduale Fellowship Program
(MMU'F) at the College.

The Mellon Foundation created the LiMUF in 1988 to
“help remedy the serious shortage offaculty ofeolor in higher-
educau’on," according to the Mellon Foundation website

“I think Grinncll was chosen in part because of their work
towards diversity and achievement," said English and faculty
coordinator for M.l\'lUF Shanna Benjamin. "And because
Gr innell is srrch an outstanding liberal arts college."

The program is named for Benjamin Mays—an African
American man who was a mentor to Mar tin erther King J12,
and later became president of Morchouse College in Atlanta.
It offers the opportunity for up to any live students in the sec-
rind-year class to conduct independent research widr a faculty
member for two years. '

“We identify students in the second semester of their sec-
ond year, they are the kind of individuals that know when: they
want to go and have a clear sense. what they want to do," Benn
jamin said. “What we do is help dicm realize those goals."

Additionally, the ferrous will have many Options to attend
seminars, regional conferences, and summer research oppor—
tunities. According to Benjamin, after Grrnndl, the lollows
could receive extra grants for research, loan repayment, and
other valuable resources.

“Once you are a Mellon you are always a Mellon." Benja-
min said. “Once you leave Grinndl, you will be part nfa na-
tioriwide network of scholars and you will have support in the
process of achieving a PhD."

Students will be chosen based on a eompeotive application
process that includes a cover page, two essays, and two letters
of recommendation including one ﬂrom a prospective mentor
by the end of the month.

Grinnell Mock Trial competes at nationals

Underdog team performs at competive national stage, credits lack of law school

BYBASSILALCHEIKII

This past weekend, Gr'innell’s Mock Trial team surprised
colleges across the country by advancing and participtrt g
at the national mock trial competition, beating Brown U
vers'tty and tying the University of Virginia on way to an
overall lrorl recortl. only 48 out ofovcr 600 college teams
in the country mad t to the national level, where students
rritd a defamation c. c in journalism. "Vi/e had been work
ing on this case all year,"said Julia Reese
'10 “It was a rewarding experience to see
us compete at nationals—n level where
Harvard didn't make it to this season,"

\Vhilc Gr-inncll's Mock Trial team
has been competing for 14 years, this
year was the team's highest plnccmcnr
in a national tournament. “The team
is definitely an underdog." Reese said,
“You don’t expect schools wrthout a
law school to perform this well, hilt we
changed that this year"

Team mcmbers said the high level ofcomperrtion did not
fnze them during the trials. “We were poised and confident,"
Sam VVrce '09 said. “We weren‘t pressured, because we never
expected to get this far'7 hence why we’re an underdog,"

Thc team's success sterned primarily from an intense levr
cl of practicing, as members devoted large amounts of time
and effort to repeating the some case throughout the year.
“We ran this mock trial scenario 36 times at different com—
petitions,” Reese said. “At times, we would practice three to
four hours in the morning and in the evening."The mem-
bers even cut their winter break short to practice on campus
a week prior to the start of the second semester.

Fellow team member Adam Lange ’11 said that another
reason for thier victory is a new style of practicing, "As the

”ll was a rewardlrlg {WEI/Elite
to 568 us compete at narlon—
aliia level Wllé’lE’ Harvard
dldn’t make ll [0 [ll/S season.”

school year progressed, we st -tcd relying on group practiCr
es a lot less and instead, doing more one-on-one practices,
where we can ﬁncrtnne what needs work," Langc said. “Five
Iowa schools made it so we were not surprised who we saw
at the competition, and we dcfrnitclv knew what to expect."

According to Reese, the tcam's unique strength is the
ability to look at any case differently from most other terms.
“We don’t look like lawyers," Reese said, “but when it comes
to the trial, our trrrmp card is the intel-
ligence, prepiirirron and insight into legal
martc and arguments that other teams
mts .'

someone vital to the team's preparer
lion and practice is local attorney Brad
McCall. "He has helped us with not only
theory, but how to deliver your Ideas dur»
ing a trial," Lange added “if you ealcur
lrltcd how much time Brad puts into us
and his hourly rates, it adds up to a hugc

donation,"

This )car, the Mock Trial team has been working on a
defamation cnsc, regarding a politician who allegedly lost an
election due to libel from a reporter in a tabloid magazine.
The mock magazine reported that the politician committed
first degree murder, which was later found false by forensic
sclunllsts.The politician then took the case to court. Prior to
the competition, the team then decrded whether it will take
the prosecution or defense side.

Tire team is somewhat optimistic about next season, “We
definitely have the tools and resources to succccdi it all
depends on who we recruit," Reese added. "We are now dcfr
nrtely prepared for these competitions—however, our short-
coming rs the strength of other teams.”
