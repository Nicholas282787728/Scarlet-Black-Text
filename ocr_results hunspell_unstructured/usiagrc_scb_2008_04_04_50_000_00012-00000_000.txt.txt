No smoking, no talking One last lick at a dead horse Nerd rage against Windows

I’d like to request that people stop
talking on cell phones in Burling Library,
especially on the upper ﬂoors. If smok-
ers want to smoke, they go outside. Cell
phone users should stop being lazy (and

Students speak loud) and do the s mic

about what’s on
their minds in 142
words or fewer’
and you’re invited!
If you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[yorkkath], Com<
plaining in a public
forum is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

Jean Gm was not an 38,000 comedian
Come Saturday at 7:00pm, when Jean Gme ar~
rived at Harris, we all discovered that Concerts
did not own CD] turntables and a mixer eirher
not was it acquired. (Apparently, mmmhlss are
rnmrahlrs— never mind vinyl or CDJ.) Instead
of taking her $8,000 and going back to New
York. Jean Grac ate and Came up with some-
thing for a show. Kweli (who, she promised to
bring along, no extra Cost, next time) would not
ﬁre her for rhar shi)ur—rltther"a certain com-
ment she said, and Kweli deﬁnitely would not
have performed had he nor had equipment. It
is cool to feel offended if lean Grae was not
PC enough, but let‘s not take certain comments
out of conrcxt. And umm, we broke contract
so umm, she did more than mos: artists would
have Jnsr for the record

I hate the'VVindows machines on this
campus so much. i just about OiﬁceSpaced
one rlxis morning after it took four minutes
to boot up to the point where I could click
on the Firetox icon and wet a browser window,
which might not seem like 2 lot, but it really :5.
People donr play games on these computers,
or it [hey do,1ve never seen it happening, so

’ whar rhe hell is the dual? L33T MAC OS X

machine two over: ~50 seconds to boot. There
is no excuse to have Windows machines on
this campus, except maybe to run some stu-

pid graphing software (sorry IVInlhletes) that
should probably be open-source anyway. I vote
to donate all these Windows machines to peo-
ple who can use them for sewers or something
rind get machines that pull their weight.
