Democrats will send an evenly
split delegation to the party’s
district convention as a result
oi Saturday’s presidentialr
preference groupings in
Malcom.

In what convention Chair-
man Kevin Crim said was one
iii the largest local turnouts
ever (or a county meeting of
Democrats, the 172 delegates
gave nearly equal district
representation to Missouri
Congressman Dick Gephardt,
Illinois Senator Paul Simon,
Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis and the Rev
Jesse Jackson Uncommltted
delegates were also viable at
the county convention and will
be represented at the district
level. .

The question going lnto
Saturday's convention was
what nould happen to those
delegates who had supported
former Arizona Governor
Bruce Babbitt, whovhas since
dropped out oi the presidential

‘race. Many or the Babbitt
delegates wound up among the
ranks ol the uncommitted.

When Saturday's convention
ended, the presidential cons
tenders emerged with the
lollowing delegate strength:
Gephardt. 5; Simon. 5,
Dukakis,4;Jackson, andunr
committed, 3. ,

The breakdown of actual
supporters at the county level:
Gephardt, 3 .'Sim0n, 38;
Dukakis. 35: Jackson, 34; and
vuncomlnltted, 26,

Crim. who last week declined
to seek another term as county
chairman aiter nearly nine
years at the helm, said Satur-
day's convention went relative-
ly smoothly.

“It was the iirst time we'd
tried one that large.” Crim
said, "We had to backtrack to
veriiy credentials. out things

When you finally finish War and Peace, a small celebration
is in order.

went smoothly irom that point
on. We rinished at 3:45 pm.
and if we hadn't had to
backtrack. we could have been
done by 3 o'clock,"

The county convention
unanimously adopted a resolu-
tion praising Crim for his years
of service to the party. Crim
was given a standing ovation
alter the reading of the resume
tion which cited his organiza-
tional and oratorical skills, his
work with students. and the
party's success during his
tenure.

Delegates adopted a broad
platiorm containing sections
on agriculture, social pro
grams, the economy, deiense.
environmental issues,
educaton, ethics in govern»
ment. and toreign policy.

Not surprisingly. the
Democrats blasted the Reagan
administration's economic
policies, declaring that the
US. ',‘is in a state of national
economic emergency“ alter
nearly eight years oi
Reaganomics. The
convention's platiorm calls ior
an increase in the minimum
wage, stronger regulation of

banks and savings and loan
associations “to adequately
protect depositors." and a con
[inﬂation of state efforts to pres
mote the creation oi jobs by
locally owned and controlled
enterprises.

Despite the presence at a
large contingent of Gephardt
supporters, the convention
easily passed a plan declaring
that "fair trade policies should
be negotiated, and restrictions
on imports should be used as
the last resort to eniorce these
agreements.”

But Gephardt’s stance on
iarm policy won broad sup-
port. The convention endorsed
a plank which declares that
"agricultural production

should be kept in line with de-

mand through mandatory con-
trols established iollowmg a

reicrendum by iarmers, as m
thleI Harkianephardt Farm
Bi

The party acknowledged the
plight oi Social Security ”notch
babies" by calling tor a reform
or “notch group inequities,"
and declared that Social
Security “should be removed
from the regular budget pro-
cess and made an independent
agency helping to insure the
continued solvency of the
Social Security Trust Fund."

Another major plank in the
area oi social programs deals
with homelessness, The party
endorsed “the right ni
Americans to decent emergen-
cy shelter, existing programs

that should be aiding the
homeless, the restoration oi
iederal iunding for housing
programs to 1931 levels, the
Homeless Persons Survival

Act. . . and passage oi similar

legislation."
The platiorm also calls [or
improved housing and care for
victims at AIDS, as well as me
creased iunding ior AIDS
research and education.
Asserting that the party
"believes in a strong and em»
clent national deiense which
works‘ ‘to promote peace and
justice ior ourselves and the
world," the county convention
called ior greater eiiicieiicy in
deiense spending and the pro
secution oi deiense contractors
who habitually show cost over

runs. The Democrats gave uh»
oualiiied support to the INF
treaty to limit medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe and
called ior a 50 percent reduc
tion in long~range weapons and
the prohibition ol “oliensive
applications oi Star Wars
technology,"
