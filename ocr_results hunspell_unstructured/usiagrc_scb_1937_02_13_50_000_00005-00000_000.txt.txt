insists on a light smoke

"My voice is my career. It has in-
spired more than ﬁve million people
to conﬁde in me their personal prob-
lems. During 25 years, ﬁn: on the
lecture platform and then on the air,
I have never missed a single engage-
ment because of my throat. I am a
steady smoker, and because my throat
and voice are vital to my career I in—
sist upon a light smoke. In Luckies I
ﬁnd a light smoke plus the enjoyment
of ﬁne tobacco . . . and that’s why
Lucky Strikes have been my choice

for 14 years.”

FRIEND AND COUNSELOR

of».

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women~lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

“The Voice of Experience” veriﬁes the wisdom
of this preference, and so do other leading artists
of the radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices
are their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat prev
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
