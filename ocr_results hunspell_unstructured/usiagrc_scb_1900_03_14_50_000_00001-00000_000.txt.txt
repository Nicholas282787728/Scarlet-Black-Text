Pres. Gates' Resignation.

To THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES or town
Cocccoe:

When in May, i837, i entered upoti the
duties oi the presidency oi iotva College,
1 did so with the expressed ltope and me
tention oi giving the remaining years oi
my active liie to the service oi the Coir
lege. 1 had no other purpose then, and
have not in thetntervening yearschanged
that purpose until now, when a sheer
physical necessity makes a continuance
much longer oi my work ior the college
a practical impossibility. As most oi
you already know my iamilyisnot liv—
ing in Grinnell tor the reason that Mrs.
Gates can not longer live in this climate.
She has tried iaithiiilly to endure a Cllr
mate which has increasingly mastered
every eiiort, until at last she isiorhidden
by physicians ever to attempt to live in
iowtt again, Sheisnow with our chil-
dren at Colorado Springs, in which cite
matesheis, you will he glad to know.
entirely well. One may not rightly he
asked to live and work permanently a
thousand miles away irom his iamily.

ihave been expecting to resign my
othce to take eeiect at the end oi the Cur-
rent college year, in June; hut the argue
merits and urgency oi the iaculty have
persuaded me to postpone laying down
the work until aiter the summer months,
and even until the ensuing college year
shall he well on:itsway. l have decided
thereiore to reconsider my purpose and
to plan, so iar asl can now determine
the iuture, to stay with the college until
next Novemher, li, however. meantime
the trustees can ﬁnd and choose my suc-
cessor, it will he aspecial pleasure to me
to assist in his inauguration at any time
prior tn that date.

iam unwilling to lay down the oiiice
held ior thirteen years without adding a
wordcxpressive oi my appreciation oi
the strong support tvhich i have received
during all these years irom the board oi
trustees. This, oi course, does not mean
that you have always agreed with me or
even among yourselves in regard to the
almost innumerable matters oi detail
which have occupied theatteiition oi our
meetings; hut it does mean that i can
count it agreatprivilege to testiiy to you
my appreciation oi your loyalty to the
general method and purpose oi the ad
minisliailon-which i have endeavored to
give to the oiﬁce with which you have
honored me. Even in matters in which
some oi the hoard have held opinions
and judgments someivhat widely differ
ent irom my own, we have nevertheless
in the end tvrought together in a temper
and with a purpose whose results are
seen in the strong progress which the
college has made during these years.
For this generous support and continued
loyalty i desire here to express my 3pc
preciation and thanks. My work and
plans have oiten demanded much par
tience irom you, which you have not
iatled to exercise. While many ambi—
ttonsl have had ior the college have
necessarily railed oi realization because
we could not ohtain meatis to push the

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

 

college to its pos le growth, yet it
would he singularly ungrateful oi us not
to recognize the good degree oi progress
which has been made on yonder campus
while we have wrought \ogethcr.

During this time the resources of the
college have increased irom an annual
income oi nineteen thottsand dollars in
1887 to about nity thousand dollars now.
The number oi annual graduates has in»
creased irom ahotit twenty to iorty and
titty, and this ycara climar oi oversixty.
This growth has not hcen at the expense
oi quality, ior lowa College has no cheap
diplomas to oiier. lowa College has not
nor does it desire growth in mere numr
hers and material prosperity at the e»
pense oi the best academic quality and
the maintenance oi the most worthy tra-
ditions oi American college education.

There are several suggestions which i
shall hope to contribute to your consider
ation beiore I ﬁnally leave the work, but
there are two matters which because at
immediate concern may proﬁtably re~
ceive attention now.

it would seem wholly wise that the
same cooperation which has ior several
years exlsted hetween iaculty and trus—
tees in ﬁtting vacancies in the body oiinr
structors should continue. lhopc it may
be applied ever. to the presidency. While
the trustees must elect, the iaculty have
a yet more intimate and vital interest in
securing the best available man ior this
oiﬁce. Tltis is not a superﬁcial or inclr
dental suggestion hut is in the line oi the
clear policy which has increasingly pre-
vailed among us. i believe it to he the
only wise policy in college and university
administrauon. it certainly ialls in wttli
the principles oi a true democracy.

The second matter concerning which i
wish to say a word, is this: There has
been much distraction, too much, about
the Callege»about, not In; ior we have
gone steadily on tti our grotvlh and work
hereiiii recent years, arising irom the at-
tempt oi the college in one department,
somewhat new in both tianie and nature,
to apply to the social, industrial and po—
litical conditions oi otir time the teach
ing oi the gospel oi Him whose natne this
college hears oii its seal, Naturally the
discussion oi such themes, in which nearr
ly everyone has the iritertscst interest,
must elicit much diiierence oi opinion
and wide espression oi it. There will
also inevitably arise much misunder—
standing. Concerning one aspect oi this
much—discussed matter, my cotirse has
seemed to me clear. Atty momberoi the
iaculty oi lowa College, who can he such
oiily hy the vote oi the hoard oi trustees,
mttst receive the loyal support of the care
ecuttvc oihce. Especially should tlits he
true oi any instructor who was placed in
the iaculty hy the unanimous vote oi the
hoard oi trustees. until such vote is
changed, one who is charged with the
chiei executive responsibility oi the Gale
lege would he singularly unrecognizant
oi his ohligations were he to iatl to sits-
tain, in the midst oi whatever storms oi
criticism, the integrity oi the postttoti.

Through all the discussion which has
gathered ahout lowa College in the pub-

lic mind in this matter i believe the coir
lege, though it may have suitered some
losses, has made immeasurahly larger

ward and not backward. There is in eed
a new and wide Constitueliey oi the Colr
lege, wider atid ntore important than
many oi the trustees realize, who are
watching with strained interest the course
the college will take at the present junCr
titre. Let there he only a iearless Courr
age, unconditioned loyalty to truth, and
the iorward look which should mark
those who believe in a kingdom oi God
on earth and in great reiorms that must
come in order to the realization oi that
kingdom,

lnleavingthts college i shall cherish
one unspeakable comiort: i have never
tor a moment in these thirteen years
soughtatiy good, or any one's good, httt
only the good oi the college. Any fail»
tires, and there may well have been many.
have not been due to a narrow purpose
or selﬁsh aims. Whatever happens the
college must gain. 1 am glad to leave
the college at a time oi its prosperity.
There were never so many students as
now, The senior class is twenty per cent.
larger than ever heiore, and ﬁity per
cent. larger tltanever heiore withasingle
exception, the class oi thos. There is no
more harmonious iaculty, and there are
no better relations hettveen iaculty and
students. 1 never knew a ﬁner spirit in
a student body than has prevailed here
ior years. So that ti 1 must ever leave
lowa College there could not he a better
time than with;this last class oi the cine
tury. it is a good time ior a new era to
begin oi growth, expansion and press

Choose A. GATES.

Response of Tru'stees.

The trustees oi lowa College have re
cetvcd and accepted with proiottnd re-
gret the resignation oi Dr. George A.
Gates irom the presidency oi the college,
to take eiiect not later than Novemher i,
tooo. in accepting his restgnation, we
deem it tittiiig and due to President
Gates, to ourselves and to the public,
that we give expression to our deep sense
oi loss, and our sincere appreciation oi
the services'and devotion he has given
the college during the past thirteen
tears.

That Di. Gates should ior any reason
be compelled to sever his relations with
the college is to us a matter oi hearticlt
sorrow. But since, in the providence ot
God, health and liic are not possihle to
Mrs. Gates in the climate oi Grinnell, we
can not ask nor expect President Gates
longerto sacriﬁce his home and family
liie in the service oi the college.

While he has been at the head oi the
institttnon oi learning under the control
oi this hoard, his strength and manly
character, his irankncss and willingness
to cooperate with the hoard, have been
notahle, and have constantly woii our ap—
proval and admiration. His iaith in the

college has been strong and uniailing,
His devotion to its interests has bean
proved by sacriﬁces which iew men
would have made. His inﬁutnce with
the steadily increasing student body has
been tiniiormly upliiting and strongly
stimulating to the noblest ideals of
thought and lile. He has been fearlus
in the advocacy of what he has regarded
as truth. He has always sought to at»
tnin his ends by di cot and bonorabl:
means. He has always iairly and care.
iully represented the opinions oi those
who difiered from' him, and he has al-
ways weicomed in akindly spirit their
criticism. His great sympathy for hu—
man suffenng hits causcd him to Iak: :
deep interest in all movements to better
the Candi on of th: unfortunate (and dis-
tressed. His abhorrence oi corruption
and his outspoken denunciation of it,
have made him enemies and entitled him
to the gratitude oi all good citizens.

The trustees also sincerely regret the
loss oi the presence and .eitamplc oi his
excellent and devolcd wifet Sh: has
done much in many ways to assist and
improve the young ladies oi the college.
and she has'heen an inspiration to all
who Came within the inﬂuence of her no-
ble womanhood. We hope for her and
ior her husband a speedy entrance upon
that large sphere oi useiulness tor which
their culture and experience ﬁt them.
and which we sincerly trust awaits them
