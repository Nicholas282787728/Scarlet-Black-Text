Ending Gay, Oppression

Homophobia is rampant throughout the U.S. and unforr
tunately, Grinnell is no exception. True, we are a bit
more enlightened than most colleges, but not near enough
serious attention has been given to the problem of
homophobia or to gay/alternative lifestyles.

One modest suggestion: How about a lecturer or two, a
film or two, or even a week-long series on gay oppression
in America. The issue certainly deserved atttention and
certainly has not received much from the college.

a r a: s s

In public and private schools, in church, on the job, in
violent homophobic attacks, in government, in health
care research, on TV, and subsequently on the streets,
homophobia and gay oppression are exu—emely evident.
It’s usually not too hard to find a conversation (usually
among men) speckled with hateful, insecure talk of “fagr
gots, wimps, pussies," etc. Machoism prevails.

The most wide-spread evidence of gay oppression is the
common assumption that a person is heterosexual . it is
prevalent in our speech and our society.

Grinnell alumnus Richard Cleaver (’75) articulately
notes this assumption in the following excerpt from his
article in the Nov., 1983 Missouri Valley Socialist:

“Struggling against this heterosexual assumption is
perhaps the most important part of interacting with gay
men and lesbians as well as hearing witnesss to the rest
of the world. Look around: are the only people touching
one another members of the opposite sexes? Are sleeping
arrangements based on the assumption that only mixed
couples share beds? Are domestic partners of all kinds
'welcome at parties? One half-facetious suggestion I once
saw in a list of hints to straight men was, ‘Don't invite a
gay man someplace where there will be straight men
unless you tell him in advance. He may not want to be
with them.‘ And a good button to wear is the one which
says, ‘How dare you assume I'm heterosexuali‘ Wearing
it or otherwise not challenging all assumption'that you
are gay or lesbian. is a good way to show solidarity and
get a feel for what it is like to be in our shoes. Such an op—
portunity to experience another's oppression is rare:
seize it."

One recent action of importance was the Lesbian and
Gay Organizing Committee’s (LOGC) September 29th
march and rally at the United Nations. The march
organizers listed the following demands:

“The freedom to live openly as lesbians and gay males
from our youth to our old age; and an end to antirgay
violence by governments and institutions, and on the
streets and in our homes; equal rights and equal access
to housing and employment of all forms; our right to have
and keep our children; an end to discrimination in any
form against people with AIDS, and increased funding for
research and treatment of AIDS; and an end to antirgay
immigration laws in all countries of the world."

The Scarlet and ‘Black fullrheartedly supports these
proposals. We further urge the college community, The
Rosenfield Committee, and the college administration to
become active on this issue. Gay oppression is a pressing
problem of our times; it is a problem of Grinnell, the
US, and humanity.

‘Grounds for thought’

1)) Ellen \i‘diiistot-k

Maybe you've seen th’
newsreel. Presidentrclcct '
holds up a newspaper. grinning
broadly. The headline reads:
“DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN".
shortly belore television made
eleclion results llash all over our
country and tell us what our peers
in the lime Zones to the east were
deciding. it wa a time when
editors weren't giving the
hlissouran half a chalice. and
printed up their giiesstimaic

It you vlere show ii that
liewsreel. maybc in the Social
studies class, you're possibly ci-
periencing some deja vu at the
press's treatment of \ialter Mon-
dale's bid for the presidency.
Words like “landslide" are being
volleyed in all directions, making
many people iccl hopeless and
disgusted. leading them to stay
home and moan aboul the slim
prospects pl getting as old as
Reagan. There‘s Jusl one thing to
say to these people DON'T no
IT}

The "landslide" is in the eyes of
the conservalive beholder First
of all. Eliot depends on which
pollster one believes The biggest
Reagan advantages ranged
recently lroin tail to liltecn per-
-ent overall. which does not put it
in the "hopeless casc" category.

Then. there‘s the problem that
polls are generally based on
representative samples ol the
population. This ignores the lact
that the population does not vote
"representalively". According to

a Des hloines Register article by
Peter Francese, publisher ot
.iincritaii ilriiiugrapiiics
magazine. a more do percent 01' 18
- 24 year olds bothered to vote in
1980. as compared with 70 percent
01 people over 55

l-‘ranccse goes on to show the
importance oi the "gender gap"
and its link with aging. the
maletlemale ratio lroin ages 18 ,
24 is 100.93 The ratio lor ages «to ,
6451002110 and over the age at so
there is the astounding ratio ol l50
women per 100 men lti other
words. a 70 percent turnout
among overrdis will bring 5.4
million more older women than
older men to the polls, older
vi omen have several reasons to be
especially angry willi the Presir
dent , his lack ol attention to
Social Security and Medicare
especially touches those who
haven't built up their ovln savings
and pensions by working, and
those who \\ill live longer and
need medical care There is also

the media appeal to these voters
at Gerry Ferraro. who alter all is
not a kid and is a good prospect to
try to improve the lot 01 her peers,

Added to this ﬂash of hope lroni
our elders is the Lou Harris
statistic that Reagan has a mere
six percent lead with voters over
50 lNalional Public Ratio, "morn

There‘s still a lnonlh to Close
this gap. and you've got a vaca»
tioli coming up, Sure, you've got
schoolwork to do, nd the parents
and friends [0 talk \\ ilh. but one 01
the nice qualities oi democracy is
that every little bit counts
There‘s probably a day in there
somewhere you could spend mak~
ing local phone calls or register
ing voters or stuliing envelopes. A
call to your local party head»
quarters will usually lind you a
variety oi things that need your
able mind or leel or lingers, and
it's a pretty small price to pay lor
living in such a nice country which
lets you speak your mind most or
the tinle and gives you opporr
tunities to lecd. clothe and
educate yourself ll" you won't do it
l’or yoursell, do it tor some Pole or
Soviet citizen \tho can‘t. Above
all, vote! it's pretty sad that our
age-mates in 1972 loughl tor the
right oi lttzl year olds to vote. on-
ly to have a mere 40 percent at us

my car breaks down.

Since 1 have what might
modestly be considered a lair

would be a good idea to havc my
car taken care at before I left for
school. Procurlng my mother's

Less than one week later. \‘lllilc

Socialist Party is building

by iii-ran Kendall

Much discussion has and is lakr
ing place within the Socialist Par-
ty to whether or not the right
dec ion was made by the Na
tional committee \illcn they deCldr
ed not to run a Socialist candidate
in President in 1984 Alter all is
not the goal ola political organl -
tion to tilt the oliice oi the preSIr
dent-l Yes. the goal is to occupy
the oval olrice. but not at tho
sacrilicc ol occupying local 017
liccs.

With the limited {manual and
human rcsourccs which the
Socialist Party has, \\e have
decided that it would be more
bcncllcial to us to organize and
rui candidates on the stale and
loc levels As a grassroots
political movement we lnust re-
main as closc as possible to the
fundamental ideas which are
prevailing in the working class

A candidate running on a local
level knows the positions and inir

portalice ol local issues which are
the backbone lol' national and iiir
ternalional issues. Just as local
government is the backbone tor
the state. the State Is for the
ledcral.

II the Socialist party did run a
presidential candidate and thc
candidate won. the U S. would not
be a socialist couiitr ii president
must have the support at the local
and state levels lo be successful.
in 1934. we are not "going lor the
gold" but are rather building a
foundation: All indestructible
value system based on the respect
tor all humans and the belief that
no person has the right to subject
aiiotlicr lor personal gain.

tliily aller socialist values are
accepted at the local levels can
they be accepted on the state and
national levels. We see our goal as
working to inform the working
class 01 an alternatlvc‘ an alter
native which begins on the local
lcvcl. ‘

naturally. the problem was
more coiiiplex‘ than a loose

he'd have to take the car in and
