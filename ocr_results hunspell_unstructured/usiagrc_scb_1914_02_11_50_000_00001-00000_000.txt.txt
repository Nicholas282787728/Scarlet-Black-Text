evening or i-lirc pleasure to the ca-

Mr. Kl‘etsler is esscntially an intel-

a remarkable control ot the wouderiul

llischa Elmdu, who was heard in Grin-

of this contrast has heelt noticed in

emotional player, and he expressed in
the Hullmi‘esque all the delight or
youth in the sweetness or love; iir.
Kerisler's iiiiiiioresuue was the work
