Poli’rical Science Dep+. Rel-urns;
Was Founded In I885 By Prof. Macy

Griiiuell students again may
join the ranhs or such distinguish—
ed Crinncllians in the field of
politics as Harry Hopkins, Chester
Davis, Paul Appleby. and Fred
ich Miller, with the reestablish-
ment next semester, or the de-
partment of You cal Science.

Following the retirement or Dr.‘
John W Gaiiiiway, head of tiie
department, in 1943, and because of,
the wartime inch of teaching perry
sonel, the History and Govern—l
nient department included thel
teaching or political science in
its curriculum. Next semester,
however, will sue the department
reactivated under the chairman-
ship or Dr, Joseph Dunner. pro
fessor of goverllmcni. An expert
in the field of American gover -
ment will be added to the teach-
ing staff, students may Carmen»
trate in this field with 32 hours
or study.

The Grinnell political science
department, one of the oldest of
its hind west or the Mississippi,
was established in 1885, by its
head, Dr. Jesse Macy, beloved
Crinnell professor, who served the
school in this capacity until his
retirement in 1912.

A few or Prof. Macy's more
well-known students were Hops
hins, who became president
Roosevelt's pvi'sonztl adviser, Dav-
is, tormcr AAA head, and mains
her or the Federal Reserve Board,
Applchy, former undersecretary of

, Agriculture, and now Assistant
Budget Director ,and Mrs. I—Ialiie
Flanagan Davis, former director
or the WPA National Theatre,

Dr. Macy introduced a new
approach to the teaching of poll»
tical science. His plan was to
teach the subject as an objective,
scientific study, rather than purer
ly theoretical. He was also one
of the first to introduce student
opinion in class political discus-
sions.

Succeeding Prof. Macy in the
department chair was Dr. Ganna-
way, who won a Republican seat
in the Iowa Legislature in last
week's election. Among the pupils
of Prat. Gannaway who achieved
recognition are Iowa Supreme
Court Judge Frederichivliller, and
Mason Ladd, head of the Iowa U.
law school.

Members or the class or 1948
will be the first to come under
the new concentration plan, which
is scheduled tostart early next
Veer. .

tor.

The organ, costing between

ranges of pipes instead of the
present twenty-ﬁve,

The pusatif is the newest dee
velopment in organ building.
This section is constructed upon
the lines of organs used in the
time of Bach and Handel, and it
enables the organist to play the
music of that period with the
Briginal tone qualities, since the
stops have a somewhat different-
sound than those of the modern
period.

The old organ will be stored
for the present and will be in-
stalled in the fine arts building
when it is erected.

Presenl'ed Friday
By Eleanore Skok ,

By Bill Wilson

Eleanor Slmk, dramatic soprano,

accompanied by Margaret Denni-
son, presented a varied program
to her Grinnell audience last
Friday evening.

Although the “German Lieder"
represented some or the lesser
hiiown compositions, Miss Skok’s
interpretation of these was arr
tisticaliy done. she gave deepi
feeling to her songs, and excellent
breath support to tones and long
phrases. Her German diction was
faultless.

In the “Shepherdess”, by Mac
Muirough, Miss Skok used her
otneiivise too consistently nee
glectod piaiiissinio. It was in this
artistic performance that she prov-
ed what was suspected, that Miss
Skoh is a lyric soprano _

Miss Dennison, the accompanistl
used majestic motions to give the)
needed support to the many heavy
selections sung by Miss Skok.

How would you handle the
business for a club whose mem-

bership totals 73 per cent of the
Campus? Weekly meetings? Well-
nign impossible Even monthly
gatherings would be a real probe
lciii to organize. Yet the express—
ed purpose or the club is one that
requires periodical uspr'cading of

each member is sure to be lllr
terestcd.

It‘s a pe'rplexerea brow-wrink—
ler, indeedeor at least it was, un-
til the guiding lights of Anchors

club, round a way to contact all
the 349 men and 7 women enrolls

going through the inevitable con-
fusion of scheduled meetings for
such a large group

The solution lies in the publi-
cation of a dope-sheet, which is,
