Say Something. . . Damn-it

An interesting question arose at the Joint Board (J.B.)
meeting on Wednesday, November 14. The J.B. was
debating the issue of whether they ought to be a
signatory to a letter condemning the United States’
belligerent policies toward Nicaragua. The issue itself is
both intriguing and important, but what stands out about
the Joint Board meeting is the persistent ambiguity con-
cerning the S.G.A., its role, and the extent of its voice.
And, of more concern is the attitude of the Grinnell Col-
lege students toward national and international politics.

One member of the Joint Board expressed Wednesday
that, “we [the Joint Board] have a mandate to represent
the student body on political issues . . . ” Another Hall

Wresident, though, explained that she had spoken to
several members of the dorm which she represented, and
they had expressed that they did not elect her on the basis

of her political ideals. Should the S.G.A. make these im» ‘

portant political statements?

This question became even more relevant when a mo-
tion was made to present the Nicaragua issue to the stu-
dent body to vote on in the form of a referendum. The mo-
tion was defeated, essentially because the S.G,Al
members know through experience that referendums are
never successful because so few students vote. Only bet-
ween thirty and forty percent of the student body votes on
referendums, clearly not enough people to determine a
codified statement. So, we see the students deferring
their voice on political issues, but not, according to the
opinion circulating around campus, to the S.G.A,

Should not somebody be saying something? The United
States government not only rules us, but assumes to
represent our interests and ideas on matters of foreign
policy. For example, the U.S. government provided the
Nicaraguan Contra’s with manuals explaining how to
behave as terrorists and assassinate their elected
leaders. This policy was enacted, in theory, in die interest
and with the approval of the American people.

Over forty colleges and universities have signed the let»
ter concerning Nicaragua, including our neighboring and
in many ways similar college, Carleton. Why are the
students at more than forty campuses across the country
making statements about foreign policy while Grinnell
students are not?

The issue of concern here is not the Nicaraguan ques»
tion, but the question of where the Grinnell students stand
and why. Or, maybe, the question is whether the Grinnell
students have a stance at all.

There are many critical and relevant situations and oc-
currences in the world today There is a Government in
South Africa which, with the support of the United States,
is keeping twenty-three million people in a sub-human,
slave condition, There is a government in El Salvador
which, with the support and blessing of the United States,
is slaughtering hundreds of citizens. There is a Soviet
Government determining the policies of Poland and not
allowing free speech or many other “self-evident" rights.
These are, indeed, but a mere shadow of the things going
on in the world which affect us or affect people like us
about whom we should be concerned.

Most importantly, there is a nuclear arms race which
not only has provided the ammunition for ending human
life, but which perpetuates an attitude between people
which makes such an outcome more and more likely.

Where is the Grinnell student body? Why are not these
people with intelligence, education, and access to a
plethora of information saying something? Doing
something?

Often, very often, one hears, “I would like to do
something about the cruelty and hatred in the world or
the unfair government practices in the world, but I just
don’t have the time . . . reallv." What?

‘Grounds for thought’

by Ellen ilcinstock

hi the Great Abortion Debate
raging around this campus
recently. there seems to be one
major point which no one has been
addressmg Peopleargue whether
or not abortion is murder, or
agree that it is but that it is
unavoidable, What ls overlooked
however, is that abortion is more
than a problem,

it is also a symptom.

Abortion in the United States is
sometimes seen as a symptom oi
a “me" generation which wants
Sex to be carefree and life not to
be hampered by children But it is
also a symptom oi a society which
by and large does not tell its young
people about birth control, It is a
society which assumes that
everyone knows how babies hap»
pen. which too many Ann Landers
column bear out is not the case (“I
thought i it couldn't happen to
me"). it is a society in which
there are too many young women
growing up watching commerr
cials which tell them that the way
to a happy life is an extensive sex
life. but are given no warning
labels on what its consequences
might be,

In 1924. Lenin's government
made abortion legal in the Soviet
Union, Soon after. the abortion
rate exceeded the birth rate. NOW.
an unexamined assumption about
that would lead one to bemoan the
"godless communists" “ho would
do such a vile thing, A closer exs
anilnation tells otherwise, Aborr
tion was being used as birth cons
tl'tll. because no birth control vias
available, women. even as they
were being encouraged to go out
to work, still had a subordinate
role in that society, which made it
difficult [or them to press
demands tor a more reasonable
order Day c c centers as they
are eveli today, wcrc -c L'olllr

could mean extreme economic
hardship lor parents and child.
This example is not so diliel‘ent
ll'onl the modern United States as
people arc willing to call it

honest it those uho vlcl'c lllcl'cly
antrabol'tioll would stop labcling

plc who are antrabortiun arc in

deed pro-lite. and we have some
shining examples at that on this
campus 7 people who. besides
condemning abortion. also cons
dcmn nuclear weapons, the death
penalty. a d have other congruent
positions. on often. however, the
“pro~liters" are also against gun
control. in favor at corporal and
capital punishment, in tom of
building up our nuclear stockpile
yet further, eat lots ol meat and
watch Charles Bronson movies,
Now. not to imply that pro-liters
are all closet readers 01 "Soldier
of Fortune” it's just that too
many of them come across that
way,

others can see through this
hypocrisy in our society. even it
not all or us can. l-‘or proot. one
need only look back a tew weeks ill

tional reaction to the United
states' presentation at the Viorltl

city. our main thcinc was that we
would not give toreign aid to coullr
tries who used it tor abortions.
Stating a strong antiraborlion
stand would perhaps have been a
rcasouablc thing to do. but realize
ing the liecessﬂy ol - mbining
that with specitic encuuragcmcnt
and aid tor programs that would
make abortion lcss necessary or
desirable \tuuld lime earned us

answer is yes, what would you do
to make avdecent lite tor this lami-
ly? It you want to call yoursell
prerlll'e, hadn‘t you better think
about hon to avoid abortions [or
those who are not as lucky as you
are?

AS another primc example oi
the onesided approach some antr
abortion politicians have been
taking is the Hatch Amendment.
Senator Orrin Hatch tR-Utaht has
proposed an amendment which
would make the legality oi abor-
tion a state's decision. Therefore.
one assumes. no abortions would
be performed. at least by doctors.
in Utah. Now, as tar as i know. no
one is yet checking passports at
state borders. What this amends
nlent would do. then. is simply
rliean that women who want others
tions would have to find some exV
tra money in order to take a little
trip to a state where they werc
legally periornled. Granted, this
might be good lor transportation
industries as a sort or "consunlp»
tloli tax." but what on earth is the
logic ol it'! is it so mat orrin
Hatch can go to sleep at night with
a clean consmence that he has not
permitted a legal abortion to go on
“i ithin the boundaries ot his state?
one dares not think that such a
thing could be the reasonable pur-
pose at law,

The best thing that can come out
oi the Great Abortion Debate is a
little examination at our (J\vll

ouc oi the best parts or our

one thing a comcuian never

are luiiny. what happens between
the conception ol the yoke and
laughter is simply not a good sub-

humor make for some at the driest

But we crave a light touch to
even the heaviest of news stories.
Frequently what results is a sick
