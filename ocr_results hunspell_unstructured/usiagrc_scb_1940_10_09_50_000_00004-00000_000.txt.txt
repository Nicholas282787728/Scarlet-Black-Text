Grillnell's gl‘iddel's will travel
to Galesbui'g, 11]., this wee
end to invade Knox college s
gr iron for their second
Midwest conference game.

This is the first time in the his-
tory of the schools that Grinnell
and Knox have opposed each other
on the gi‘diron The siwdsh shzu»
ed first-place honors with Ripon
last year in the final football
ranking
One Conference Win

The Knox team, by virtue of
its 1373 victory over Lawrence
last weekend, are proving to be
one of the items on the Pioneers'
“must" list to be taken care of
Saturday afternoon.

Both teams are ranked at the
top of the conference with one
win apiece. Coe and Cornell are
also undefeated. but Coe, the only
team that has chalked up more
than one victory so far. has a,
massed three straight conference
wins. This Saturday's game will
eliminate either Knox or Grinnell
from the undefeated class.

Webb, Waiters Outstanding.

The Pioneers found that they
had stepped out of their class
last Friday night when they tried
to tackle the Drake Bulldogs zit
the Drake stadium in Des Moines
Drake climbed out on top of the
contest, winning by a score of
20-7 However, some indications
of what we can expect. in the
Knox game were given by Fred
Webb's outstanding performance
in the backfield, Comapt. Ed Wal-
ter‘s sensational recovery of a
blocked Pioneer punt followed by
a 30-yard ieturri run, Jack
Keehn's accurate place-kicking,
Tod Kennefick and Louis Gonias
playing excellent defensive roles,
and Carl Blandin doing some good
punting. Harry Barker, who n
still on the sidelines with a had
knee, will probably see little ac-
tion Saturday afternoon.

Thc workouts so far this work
have been fairly light Couch Bed
Douglas. Pioneer mentor, has been
sponsoring some seriminagcs with
the props and passing practice by
the rest of the squad. Webb ap-
pears to be wellnmpahle of hau-
dling his end of the passing C(‘mr
hinations both in practice and
iindci- fire, A little polishing this
week should make Grinnoll a dot-
inite threat from thc air as well
as in their running plays
