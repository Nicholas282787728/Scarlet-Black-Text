Perhaps this best sums up the production of “Of Thee

I Sing,” which made up for
volume.

Off to a slow start, the show
picked up speed in the latter
portions, and several notalble
performances from supporting
characters livened this much-
shortened version of the Ger:
shwin musical.

Among these notable perfore
mances was that given by John
Condon. who, in his portrayal
of Alexander Throttlabottom
“stole" nearly every scene he
was in. Condon displayed a
comic touch in this character
role which he has lacked, and,
at the risk of becoming “typeA
cast,” Condon might do well to
hang on to the character which
he has created.

Peter Parshall as the French
ambassador sometimes cori—
iused his French and Yiddish,
yet managed to establish him.

tent chnracter actor.

Among the other supporting
actors, few distinguished them—
selves. Dennis rurbush was not.
lable for the voice he used
{which was not his own. l-lis ef»
forts to portray a newspaper
tycoon showed an obvious lack
of maturity which he tried to
iovercome vocally. with little
success.

The two leads, Dan Toft
and Betty Brandt, playing

Turner, are two very seasoned
performers, well accustomed

stage. Both did very fine jobs,
yet neither developed a char-
acter. Both sang well and act
ed well, yet they never seem-
ed to be other than Dan Toft
and Betty Brandt.

It is easy to say harsh things
about this show and its per-
formers, because this is a big
show; one of the biggest ever to
be presented here, with a cast
of over 40.

On top of that we have the
problem of singing, and per—

such a show. The latter was

who provided a forestage which
nearly doubled the playing
area. But the size of the cast
and the limited time left the
show with many rough spots
and too many ad libs.

As Ned Donahoe’s first di-
recting etfort at Grinnell, this
show was certainly an ambi—
tious one. Don Jones did a
more than splendid job with
the chorus which performed

as a real team, and which at
times almost lifted the aud~
ience out of its seats with
sheer volume.

The accompanist. Carolyn
Hewes, certainly deserves more
credit than can be given here.

Perhaps the traditional judge
of the worth of a production is
the audience reaction. Since two
