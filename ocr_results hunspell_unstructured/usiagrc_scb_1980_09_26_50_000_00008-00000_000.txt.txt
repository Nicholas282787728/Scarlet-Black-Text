Bail transportation

through tho
century

This week we decided to let Graphics Editor
Barry Jarrett loose and come up with the
photo essay of his choice. Barry is what you
may call a “train nut," so we weren‘t real sure
prised when he came back to the office with a
set of rail-oriented pictures. ‘

“While the pictures deal with subjects that
span almost a century,” Barry said, ”all of the
pictures were taken in the last three years.”

As you can see, Barry can take a potentially
boring subject and . . . well, spice things up
with his own special style. We hope you find it
as exciting as the “Bear” does.
