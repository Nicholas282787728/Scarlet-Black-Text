The David
Lynch Parallel

During the 24 hours of
my ﬁrst vrsrt to Helena,
Men, I commented that
the place bore a striking
resemblance to David
Lynch’s television series
Twin Pcaks.Thc entire
town seemed to rest on
the sur-
face tcrr- a tenderfl
skirt of
something
ctr-ic,rrrrrratunrl, bizrurc. People made far too mudr eye
contact, used only ﬁrst names, and took an inordinately
long time to articulate tlicmscl\les.The place seemed to
feature a cast ofcharactcrs instead ofinhabitants, create
ing a very constant and palpable cirrcrnatic sensation.

One such character who halintcd the town's cafes
was identiﬁed simply as “the hook tliidc."ln his late 50s,
wrry and gangly, the book dude traveled wrth an ever-
ptcsent stack ol’books at his side — at least ten, I~lc os-
tensibly reveled in the role ofthl: hook diidc, as he never
carried out or two books it a tirnc,or- used a backpack
for the books, In his time living in Helena,]ohn had
only seen the book dude without his accoutiements
twice: once jogging along the main gulch, another
mowing his lawn It's nimnied that in his honie,hooks
compose the hull; ofthc furniture, and that when a new
librarian moves to town, the book dude scdticcs thcni
mth hrs love ofbcoks, them leaves them hrgh and dry
shortly thereafter. At the General Mercantile I never
saw him speak to anyone, but was repeatedly Warned
not to engage the hook dttdc, as unsticldng yourself
{mm the situation often proved near impossible

In late August, John asked me, which neighbor of
ours was stranger ~ and in fact, we were sandwiched
between a rock and an unstable placerTo the south, a
hermetic carpenter made his home, his toolshcd/work—
shop bordering our fence, He would often work at or
tatit: hours, at midnight, at seven am, cmiting terrible
grrnding noises thatl didn’t think wood could produce.
When I would read the paper outside on the patio
before going to work, he would look me in die eye as
he padlocked the door, as ifto say “Mention this to
anyone and I will end you."To the north lived a Very
Reverend with his wife and son. Jeremiah, their 35*
year- -,old still lived with his parents after distributing
his time at Berkeley ,MIT, the Department of Defense

and NASA. This genuine rocket scientist, who only

wore seventies vintage clothing and appeared mute,
produced his micromachines at the vvmdow facing out
house from one a.m. to ﬁve a.m. This activity piqued
the interest of my friend, Maggie, a woman prone to
dating eccentric types “tor the experience," After she
had approached Jeremiah a couple oftimes at art opens
ing where he reacted like she didn’t exist,we gave up on
unlocking the genius of our recluse to the north.

Upon relaying these experiences to a friend, I was
informed that David Lynch was in fact from Montana,
that he still kept a home outside Missoula, I didn't
think that my level ofrcspcct for Mr. Lynch could posr
sibly be lessened, but remarkably, in that instant, it was.
Not only were Mr. Lynch’s creations awtul, they were
unimaginative as well: he simply borrowed [lac bizarrc
frgures from the uneven larrdscapc ofhis homo.

Joys of food in the library

Right now, it's 1052, and l'vc got along night ahead
of me, Writing this column right now is actually just a
wide; form ofprocrastinurion from my homework be
cause I can tell myself that it's something I need to get
done. But alas, as soon as I’d done writing it, it’s -
back to the books. And sitting here at a computer
in Burling and looking at my fellow smdcnts,l
realize that I’m not alone. I hear voices behind
me nervously speculate how they'll get all their
reading done for tomorrow To my left a young
woman scribbles frantically in her notebook
wrth a mot between a grrmace and a scowl
on her face. And to my right two sol- _
crnn studicrs leaf drrough over-sized
textbooks, We all seciii [0 be in for
marry more hours or reading, writing,
and stumng our brains fuller than we
ever thought possible It looks pretty bleakr but there‘s
hope! Because our worn—out brains are not the only
things well be stuffrng- no, wc academic uo-gcttcts,
warriors on the front of academia, we haic ammrinir
tion. Snacks‘, That's right, every nrght countless Gtrur
ntllians walk through thc doors of Biiiling and pay no
heed to the slgll’ No Food Allowed, Drinks in Closed
Contaiucr- are permitted i admit it (and hope l will
not be punished fol my honesty) I have taken lood' into
hurling. r\t [lilacs tic benitiﬁillvrctl .rpplt or ptrlcctlv
packed hag of chips rs the only thing kctping mt gar
mg drrrrng° a long night of studying, And 1 know that
many of my colleagues feel the same. How else can you
explain the numerous trips to the Forum for sustenance
or- the grrhagc ca rs littered with tr rdy wrappers: it's
because our snacks gut rrs that cxlrii push we nccd to
keep going. Ofcoursc there’s the rnattcrot'pute energy
Yesz food 9 our bloodrsugar levels, tends off fatrgue,
gives us the caloric energy we need, and speeds up our

‘-v
apples and oranges

metabolism. Caffeine increases out alertness and int
creases adrenaline, Food kccps rrs going, quite literally,
but there's more to it than that,

Food stavcs off not only hunger (and trust me, noth-

ing is more distracting when writinga seven page pa-

, per than a need for food gnawing at your stomach)
but also boredom. How much more interesting a
reader can become iftasty pretzels are interspersed

with each page turn, how much more engaging a

book becomes ifsprrnkled with sugar from sour patcir

kids you’re eating, how much am research can

bc rfit's accompanied by a nice slice of Foe

rum pizza. Food adds another scnsory

experiencc to homework (and taste is

ncrally not engaged in studying)

. d makes for a fuller expellcncc.

Anti let’s not forget rewards. Just

like good lrttlc trained anrmrrls, food can be like a puppy

trcat, rewarding us for sitting down and doing work. It

feels great to pop open a bag of prctz rftcr tacklrng

those not fcw chapttrs, and it speeds up rho reading to
know that us waiting tlrtrc fotyou.

And there's bonding, study groups discussrng ovcr a
tub of Swedish Fish, Fricntls sharing CnsliCVVS while si»
lcrrtly pursuing their own scholastic success. lood and
lrreuds rn library make studying worth doing

Clearly, snacks rn Btirliiig take on a special signil‘r
cancc rorcaclr pct r but there rs no doubt rn my mind
that food can cnhancc unycnc's experience rn Burling.
l'm prorrd to be a rulerbrcrker (though I must add that
I do clean rrp all food rncsscsll leave and urge all those
who bring food' into the lihranl to do the slim) I bet
lrcvt rh rt snacks are one ofthc bcsr study tools a person
can have, and I pl an to utilize this tool frequently and
enthusiastic illv for the reSt ofmv years here at Grinncll.
Cheers. Now back to that paper..

 

Crazy solutions for crazy celebs

What the heck is it with all these crazy famous
people? Every day the news is full ofsome new crap
a celebrity or world leader has pulled off for seem-
ingly no reason. Singer x is involved in some torrid
affair with another and performs a mopcy/dopcy song
about it, sending thousands of preteen girls into ‘
hysterics; Actress Y marries.,.and divorces,” ,»
and marries...and divorces...and gets married
again, World Leader 2 issues a proclamation
utterly contrary to consensus. . .and aforemen-
tioned consensus is turned on its head, These
people are just plain silly! Something ,
must be done to maintain their en— ,
tertainment value while rendering
them relatively harmless to us
“sanc"mundancs,

One option that could be
considered would be chemiv
cal spraying of cities that tend to accommodate large
numbers of famous people: Hollywood, Washington,
New York, Tokyo, London, Milan, Paris, Las Vegas,
Monte Carlo and so forth, Simply aerosol the area
with an airborne cocktail of mild tranquilizers, nntk
depressants, potpourri and deodorizers to create the
best effect. Hopefully, this could neutralize the most
disturbing behavior exhibited by our cultural titans;
incidence ofthe thrcc terrors oieating disordersdrug
abuse and bad cosmetic surgery would hopefully dez

crease. Regrettably, this approach has some signiﬁcant
downsides. First: many celebrities inhale these sub—
stances (along with a great deal ofother things) fairly
regularly I don't think there's much We can do about
ccrtam families or groups of derangcd British rock
anderollerss Second: millions of ordinary folks
r would get caught up in this aerial paciﬁcation,
turning already-boring folk into masses ofun—
responsive sheep waiting for some scandal to
arise anew in the tabloids Ofcoursc, with the
celebrities chemically soothed (and creating
little news), boredom would likely rise
up as a leadrng cause ofdeath in the
developed world, which is quite
unacceptable.

Another possibility could be
found through more highstech
means: consistent advance~

ments in the world of robotics and artiﬁcial intelli-
gcncc could make way for a new generation of me»
chanical help. A far cry from today’s domestic robots
(such as the Roomba, a discoid automatic vacuum
cleaner), those newrfanglod contraptions could be one
part c-sPo, another part Sigmund Freud and a frnal
part vicious bodyguard and/or backup dancer. They

could disable paparazzi with smoke bombs...

Accommodating diversity

Grinncll is fond of steps. The Forum? Stair hell.
My room? Up 42. For a school as concerned with all
the types ofdrvcrsiry that Gr-inncli is, l was ashamed
to have m wheelchairsbound, 1211M old sister
stay here t past weekend. After visiting my- room
ind checking out the Forum, she no longer wanted
to explore the rest ot campus. I realize that the dorms
are old and future buildings will be accessible (by law ,
but that seems like a shoddy excuse to say in the face

them may want to go to alibcial arts college, but they
won’t be conting- to Gtinnell.
