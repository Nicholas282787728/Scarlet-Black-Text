WASHBURN: Answer those who

their minds that they decided to get
togetherin abig group and attack me.
The letter is signed by many people,
but there’s no question who wrote it.
It’s vintage Magill, with all his uade-
marks. There’s tautology: “The work
was long...and lasted through the
night."There’sdisagrecmcntbetween
noun and verb: “When we hear
Washbum...the hair on our collecr
tive necks go up," “We hear
themmessage of the hate mongers,
and those who...try to legitimize it.”

There's use ofa singular form where
a plural is required: “We do not see
the connection with any of the phe-
nomenon he recounts."

Apart from being gramatically
challenged, Magill is incapable of
sustained argument, sohe falls backi
not for the first time—on the smear
tactic. He suggests I'm “another
Hitler,"just as, in an earlier column,
he suggested I’m a “Gestapo Conser-
vative" In a separate letter, Amos
Cohen writes that it’s wrong to use
loosely a term like Kristallnachl, be-
cause this may drain it of its meaning

and relevance. I can hear Magill add»
ing, “That Gestapo Conservative
Mike Washbum, that modern-day
Hitler, actually invoked the
Kristallnach! in attacking liberals!"
Zachary Polsky charges that in
criticizing militantminoritiesttorgot
that racism is as severe a problem
today as in 1865 I think that racism
isn‘t nearly as bad a problem today.
Commentary gave an index of this
when it noted that blacks have been
elected mayor in many cities that are
predominantly white, Le. Seattle,
Washington and Augusta, Maine.

EDUCATION: We keep saying that
parents have to take an active role in
their children’s education and I've
found a way to make that work. It
hooks in with my economic policy. I
propose we give a $1000 tax credit
for each dependent child, but only if
that child watches less than 5 hoursof
television aweek, PBS can be Watched
without penalty. With cash on the
line, we’d seejust how many parents
would encourage theirchildren toread
a good book.

 

 

DIPPING IS FOR DIPS.

DON'T USE SNUFF OR CHEWING TOBACCO

 

 

HEALTH CARE: I would estab-
lish a fund for national health irrsur»
anceby placing a 20 percent tax on all
plastic surgery occurring in 1.03 An-
geles and the

Upper East Side of Manhattan,
And in an effort to control costs, I
would mandate thatall attorneys sub-
mit a $5000 deposit before agreeing
to handle a malpractice case. This
deposit can not be included among
their client’s fees. Ifthey win the case
they get the five grand back, plus
interest. If they lose, they forfeit the
deposirand can befined an additional
$1000 ifthejudge determines that the
lawyer is an unscrupulous ambulance
chaser.

Well, t’tat’s my campaign. Dona-
tions can be sent to the care of this
newspaper, and please, cash only.

Well hell,l‘m writingforabasrion
of PrC.-ness, Personally I'd rather
read the Quad Polls, I’d rather ask
over three hundred people are same
question all night long. I’d rather ig-
nore the people who ignore the ques-
tion. I’d rather shufﬂe food onto a
plate and try to explain that it's not
my idea that you can only take one
entree. You do have to bring your
plate back. It's notjust me, really. I’d
rather scrape blackened cheese off a
metal tray and soak my hands in liq-
uid Fun. Better yet, I’d rather spend
Friday night slipping on beer and
dislocating my knee. Or yelling at
people over eaﬂsplitlirtg music not to
pour beer on each other ‘cause I’m
net the only one who falls and gets
hurt.

Maybe I‘d rather have a nap. I
should relax more. Spend quality time
with my girl—friend. Be happy that I
got my bike back. Be happy that I
never found out who stole my bike I
should get to work early and joke
around with the staff, the wimmin in
white and the dude with suspenders. I
could use a hotbatht I could usea day
off.
