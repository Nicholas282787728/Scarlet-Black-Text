IT is with great pleasure that
the students see Professor Parker
in his accustomed place in chapel
on Thursday mornlngs, He was
connected with the college [oi
twenty years and since his resig-
nation it has seemed iinnatuial
not to see him in the class room
and about the buildings. The in.
ﬂuence which Professor Parker
'cl with successive g’cnera»
t students can never be
light it necessary to give up
' ’n the college we leel
that his inﬂuence will not be en-
tirely lost but that by his chapel
remarks he will be able to smooth
over many of the petty descourr
agements and grievances oi col-
lege work. His cheery words
have ever been a help to the stu-
dents and with no disrespect to
the other members of the faculty,
we can say that the mornings on
which he has led chapel have
always been one of the most help»
{til of the week. For the last few
years Thursday morning's chapel
has been known as Professoi Par-
kers morning. and it is with de-
light that learn that it can
still be called the same.

DURING THE last few weeks,
SCARLET AND BLACK h‘as containr
ed several aiticles calling on the
students to show their loyalty by
turning out and giving that imr
petus to the practice which the
presence of spectators always

to urge the players to turn out
and help themselves. During the
last few days the spirit displayed
by some of the varsity has been
anythingbtlt commendable. Prac-
tice has been slighted in every
possible way. The men have
been late on the ﬁeld. and have

spirit can never accomplish any
thing for the good oithc team.
All that has glvcn

each individual has worked
the success of the whole. The
Grinnell player of the glorious
past did not think of shirking
what it was his duty to perform.
That is an outgrowth of these
later times. lii the last few (lays,
