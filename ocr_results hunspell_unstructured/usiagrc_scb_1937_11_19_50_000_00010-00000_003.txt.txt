The pleasure you get out of a cigarette depends on
the quality of the tobaccos put in it. And in the
case of Camelstha'l: means ﬁner, costlier tobawos.’

HERE’S only one way to ge(
the best tobaccos. That’s to
pay more for them.

It has been awell-known fact {or

for fun lubacrm. It's the natural
way 10 put more enjoyment into
smoking.

People have conﬁdence in the
mildness and goodness of the finer
tobacco: in Camels. More and
more smokels turn to Camels.
They ﬁnd that Camels axe nam-
rally milder. Ifyou are not smok-

ing Camels, try them now And
see if you, too, don"t ﬁnd that
Camels mean unﬂiling plenum!
