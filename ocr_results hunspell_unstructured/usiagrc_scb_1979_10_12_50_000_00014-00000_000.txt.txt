stitute. But again I was too scared.
Maybe the right girl just hadn't come
along yet.

I began going out with more and
more girls. I was a robot, programm-
ed mechanically go through the mo-
tions oi sex, but I was always unsucr
cessful. The girls would feel inade~
quate or bitter and I would ieel
degraded and incapable.

I became more confused. Why was I

‘ doing something that I didn't want to

‘ do? Why was I suppressing my

‘ natural desires and subjecting myself
to the anxiety and frustration I felt

. relating sexually with women?

, How much longer could I continue

. deceiving women and making excuses
for my impotency? It seemed like
such a status symbol “to score." But
it wasn’t me, Maybe suicide was the
answer.

Before coming to Grinnell, I called
Masters and Johnson. 1 was too young
to participate and “be cured" in their
clinic for sexual dysfunctions. I then
went to a sex therapist who told me
that if I masturbated while staring at
pictures of nude women, I would
become a heterosexual.

This wasn't “just a phase " l was in-
deed a homosexual, and the sooner I
accepted this the sooner I would like
myself.

Within the last year, I have learned
to appreciate myseli I have learned
that gay isn't a disease, rather, the
ability to love someone of the same
sex, To me, gay means the [reedom to
hug and hold another man. To me, gay
means being able to cry and be sup
ported by another man.

[haven’t hurt anyone. I haven‘t
murdered, stolen, nor deceived. I am
simply appreciating Cary. And it feels

so good after so many years of guilt
and sell-hatred.

Around campus, people accuse me
of being “flagrant." I think that it's
very important ior people to know that
I am gay, because they will inevitably
be lorced to question their
stereotypes

I am not ugly and those who believe
that gay people are incapable oi being
attractive to the opposite sex will need
to think again I am not a child
molester nor a misogynist. And those
who believe gay people molest
children and hate women will need to
think again, Ian'i a person. And I need
to be held and feel warmth and care.
too.

So, the next time you say or think
“faggot,” remember that iaggots are
also people, people with feeling and
needs, and they can be hurt, too,

but your 'slippers

and light your pipe

One of the most heartwarming and
encouraging recent campus trends is
the growing number oi Republican
students seen along the hallways and
loggias in the Big G.

It is with no small flush of pride that
I reflect that here, at my college, a
student can get a fine liberal arts
education regardless or his or her
political belieis or party aiiiliation.

Republicans can sit in the front rows
of classrooms, be admitted to the
Forum without showing their le,
enter the Pub, attend concerts, and ln
general assume all rights and
privileges enjoyed by other Grin-
nellians.

Yet it wasn't always this way, and
to hear some people talk, things still
haven't changed much. There is a
small but vocal minority on campus
which wants to turn the clock back to
the days before the Thirteenth Amend~
ment to the SGA Constitution allowed
Republicans to enrolliback to the
time when a Republican dared not
even bring his pipe and slippers into
the library for fear of being beaten up

Since these people are too cowardly
to identify themselves in the pages of
their “alternatlve” newspaper. I won't

, mention names, but we all know who
they are-that miserable band of
malcontenls, the self-appointed guar-
dians of campus moral standards, who
blame the Republicans for the disap-
pearance of a vague ideal world which

‘ probably only existed in the mists or
their twisted imaginations.

The growing number of pre-meds.
pre-laws, and other ”nerds," the

, lackadaisical response to skip Day,
the new 5&8 format, and other

changes symptomatic oi deepseated
college trends are all laid at the feet
of the unfortunate Republicans. Why?
Such vicious and unfounded persecu-
tion is no different from Anita
Bryant‘s association ol homosexuals
with the decline of American Society
and values

Like homosexuals, Republicans can
not change the way they are and only
ask to be accepted as such. Why do
the Anitas, Adolfs, and 85:55 of the
world always [eel so threatened by
diversity? As a bright, sensitive,
tolerant, openrminded person myseli, I
cannot pretend to know the answer to
that question, but I do know that it is
time we all faced up to the uncomforr
table and even shocking truth:
Republicans are people, too.

Sure, they dress differently, they all
have pictures Of their families on their
dressers, they listen to Perry Como
and Neil Diamond instead of the
Grateful Dead or even Donna Sums
mer, play golf, and keep to themselves
in their Republican clusters: but they
do have some of the same feelings and
desires as the rest of us, believe it or
not.

I happen to know this because I
roomed with a Republican last
year—for the whole year. And I even
got to the point where I enjoyed rather
than endured his company. Unlike a
few Grinnellians who room with
Republicans, I didn’t decide to do so
because I [ell sorry for the poor
bastard or because i wanted to prove
to everyone what a good bleeding
heart liberal I was, but because I
thought I might like livrng with himi

It’s true, he did smoke a pipe, have

a picture of his family on his dresser,
wear leisure suits, and go to church,
but eventually I go used to these
things (although I did have to excuse
myself sometimes when he brought
his friends over) and became fairly
well acquainted with my roommate.
We had several long and intimate
talks, during the course of which I
found out that Republicans smoke just
as much dope per capita as other
campus groups, that some oi them
even engage in premarital sex, and
not all of them have fathers who are
presidents of corporations

My living situation that year taught
me a lot about Republicans and a lot
about myself, I realize that I am not a
Republican, nor would I want to be one,
but I Wouldn't mind if my sister mar~
ried one. The march of history pro-
ceeds inexorably on, and mixed mar-
riages are but one of its mileposts.

The day is not far off when
Republicans will not be ashamed to
'hold their heads up on any college
campus in this land, when they can go
to the same bathrooms as we do, live
on the same dorm ﬂoors, and eat at
the same tables in Quad, Equal righls
for Republicans are on the horizon.
and no underground newspaper or
clique of bigot: can stand in their way.
