Ovel‘rcouﬁdence is generally con-
sidered a detriment to an athletic
team. While we do not want to wish
the Drake university football players
any particular bad luck, we do rather
hope that they look on the Gl'innell
team as n push-over. If they do, they
will have a surprise coming when the
two teams tangle on the Bulldog
gridiron next Friday night.

Erich time that the Pioneers play
a game they seem to gain ,1), little
more ability, a little more expel“
ieaoe, and yet are still dcteated. In
the first grime of the season they
gave a bad demoiistnetion or foot-
ball, and auou-ed the Geo team to
upset them 7 to o. In the second
gmno they surprised sports writers
and coaches by holding the Michi-
gan State eleven 14 to 0. Then the
Iowa state Teachers team nosed
them out, by taking advantage of
the breaks. Inst weekend the Pier
nears gar-e the best showing so far
this season, and with te team now
hitting on all eleven cylinders,
perhaps Drake will be the first
victim.

The game Saturday will be the
thirtyminth grid contest played be-
tween the two schools. The first but-
tle was fought at Drake in 1895,
and since that time Drake has man-
aged to win 22 games, while the Plo-
neers have captured 15. Last year

sion of the traditional "old oaken
bucket", by downing Coach Green's
gridders 7 to o. The bucket has been
lying dormant for the past year in
the trophy case between the library
and Alumni Recitation ball, but next
Friday night, gaudily arrayed in
ribbons, it will again be in the lime-
light, almost alive.

Speaking of trophies; suggestions
are being made by various sports
writers in the conference to have
some unusual emblem adopted as a
traditional traveling trophy for the
winner of the conference title.

President of Texas A. & M.
Opposes Admission of Coeds

COLLEGE STATION, Tex.7The
administration of Texas A. and M.
college will continue to oppose the
admission of women students, T. 0.
Walton, president of the college, said
this week.

“With women in it, Texas A. and
M, would become merely another col-
lege," he declared. “It would lose a
certain distinctiveness which now
marks .it."

A suit has been filed to force the
college to admit women.

Dibble Scores
Largest Total

Defeat Langan in Speedball
Contest 26 to 4

Dibble ran up the largest speed-
hall score made so far this season
to snow Langan under 26 to 4 in
a one-sided contest Monday evening.

Leading by a 9-4 count at the end
of the halt, the winners added five
iicld goals and a pass during the last
two periods, Langan lacked by two
man enough players to term a full
team, partially explaining the over-
whelming defeat.

Hemphill led the victors in scorr
ing, checking up eight points by
means of a field goal, a free kick
and two passes. Lcaclnnan, Royal and
Putnam each contributed Six points
to Dibble's total, putting across two
field goals apiece. Taggart kicked
Langan's lone field marker and Slye

free kick.

The game scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon between Smith and Clark
was postponed on account of a wet
field. It will be played the latter
part of next week, probably Friday,

Gates and Langan were scheduled
to play this afternoon in a game that
will either strengthen the farmer's
grip on first place or leave Smith as
the lone undefeated outfit.
