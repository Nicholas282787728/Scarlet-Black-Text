"The best ever seen in Gl'iilllell"
was the remark which more than a
‘feW persons made \v 'le leaving the

Although the costume and solo
dances called forth the most vigorous
appreciatinn from the audience that
evening, the comments of various spcc—
talol‘s upon the freedom and abandon
with which the Senior Normal Trains
ihg class presented the Russian techs
nique have since been numerous. This
is the first year the Russian technique
has been attempted in Grinl‘lell, unit
for that reason the finish of the work
last Saturday evening is eunsidcrctl
even more remarkable.

“Boy l‘tluo" a Favorite.

Among the , ious solo dances of
the evening, "Little Boy Blue,” by
Miss Martha Barr was among tlle must
generally appreciated. She appeared
in a costume of blue blouse and liniclis
erbochers, With straw eureretl hair
and “Boy Blue's” horn siting over her
shoulder. Her danec was characterized
by unusual grace and abandon, res
markcble lightness and freedom of
movement and great beauty of tech-
niquc. The success of her perform-
ance was testified by the vigor with
which the audience attempted to call
her back.

In a Quaint costume or the early six-
ties, Mar-y Platt presented, in n Win-
somc manner, the French pantominc
dance, “Petite Coquette." Wild sw t-
iioss of movement, fantastic and vigon
ous grace was shown in the dance of
"The Begging Gypsy” by Josephine
Hutchinson. -

The committee in charge or the
spring dance reports that a large num-
ber ol students, alumni living in town
and a few trom out or town have matlc
arrangements to attend the affair.
The matter ot guests seems to have
been the cause of considerable diffi-
why and misunderstanding. The
plan to make the dance a st ctly Gals

to those who either have, or havc had,
direct connection with Grinnell.

The chaperoncs for the alfair will

“The Seven Last Words of chr t"

Miss Gladys Downing, M- Engstrom
and Mr. Cairic its soloists interpreted
the major parts of the Oratorio. while
the Vesper choir made up the choral
group.

The soprano solo. “Ilczii' ye all who
travel upon the highway" announced
the story which was to follow. Miss
Downing's clear (one and sweetness
of voice gave an al‘ tic and sympas
thctic interpretation.

Mr. Callie, singing all but the sixth
of the last seven Words gave his solos
a truly dramatic feeling and pathos.
“Father forgive them" and "I am a7

-. " were particularly effective. Mr.
Ellgstron . solo ”Into thy hands I
commend my soul" was intc'i'pi-ctcu
sympathetically. Two ducts by the
soloists and the choral singing of the
choir added to the beauty of the ser—
vice. A chapel full of students and

“Go to a training camp," is the atl-
vice which Prof. llolmes Beckwith
gives to Grinncll inch in a. statement
made to The Schrlct and Black today.

That more Grinncll men ought to
go to the military training camps like
the one which B. J. Carney, "Doc" Lit-
tle and others attended last summer
at Plattsburg, il. v., was the unquali-
tied opinion oi Professor Beckwith.
Mr Beckwith has had consider-able
training iii such camps and in the
army and Sneaks from experience. He
was at one timc a. member of the New
Yul-l: Training Battery and latcr at—
tended a Plattshur-g camp.

Professor Beckivith says:

“'uulll Assure Battalion.

“Tile recent agitation for the estab-
lishment of military training at Grin-
riell makes especially opportune 'at
this the subject of military training
camps this summer. indeed, those
who wish to aid the Grinnell battalion
movement may well find no more cer—
tain means that to secure the attends
ance oi as many men as possible ati,
the summer camps. With a strong
Grinnell contingent, returning inform»
ed and enthused tlotn the camps, the
Gruinell battalion would be practical-
ly assured.

Apply Ehrly.

“The tirst experimental summer-
camp was begun by General Leonard
Wood in 1913 with 264 members. In
1914 there were 763, HI 1915, 3.333, at".

citizens, with education or experience
at least equivalent to that ‘of high
school sradnatcs, and between the
ages of is anti to, arc eligible to at-
tend. The War Department cxpects
50,000 men in camp this summer. Ins
deed, according to the Military Train-
ing Camps association, applications
should he put in carly, as mere ivrli
be a waiting list inthoiit a question of
a doubt.’

Miss Ruby fielder of the School of
Music l'aculty created such a favor—
able impression before a Dos Molnes
audience last Sunday that shc has
been asked to sing again March 25 at
the final one of a series of. concerts
given by the “White Sparrows."
Three thousand ﬁve hundred pcople
attended the concert Sunday.

The following comment appeared in
the Dos Moincs Register last Monday:

“Solo honors ol' the after non by
rcasmi or novelty and true merit, Went
to Miss Ruby Helder of Grinnell col-
lege School of Muele, a young Woman
with a remarkable tenor voice. Miss
Holder's vocal chords are cast in a.
masculine mould and give forth a gen—
uine tenor tone or good depth and
range airtl of such smooth serenity and
sweet resonance that it seems peculi-
arly adapted to church music.”
