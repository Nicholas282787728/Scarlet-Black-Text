Grinnell opened the season against
Penn College at Grlnnell. At the start
or the game Griunell marched right
down the ﬁeld for a touchdown, Mc—
Intire going over for the score. The
try ior point tailed. After this score,
the Pioneers had no trouble gaining
in midﬁeld. but the Quakers held

every time when their goal was ap-_

proached. Toward the end or the

game, Penn succeeded in completing
» a pass from Covey to Quire behind the

goal line tieing the score. in the ﬁnal

minutes oi play the Pioneers tried
