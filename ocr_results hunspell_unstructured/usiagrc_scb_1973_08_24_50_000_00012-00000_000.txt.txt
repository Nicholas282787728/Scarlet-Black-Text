Senior Barry Huff led the Grin-
nell track team to sixth place in
the Midwest Conference track meet
by winning his third straight con—
ierence shot-put championship and
his second discus title. In the pros
cess he demolished the school shot
record with a throw oi st feet,
3 inches. Barry won the competi-
tion before it really got' started,
as his standing warmrups landed
beyond his opponents‘ best effort
Minutes after going through the for-
malily of his sixth and last throw,
Huff anchored the 440 relay team
to its fastest time of the year.
This must have had a demoralizing
effect on some oi thethlnnersprlnt-
ers whom Rarry gunned down in
the stretch.

Chip Hall ended an amazing iirst
season ofjavelih throw1ng by winning
the conference title with 198 feet,

one ct Mr. Obermiller’s inspiring
pep talks ("Stay loose”) aiter a

ed by tossmg the spear 20 feet

The Grinnell pioneers missed a
chance to oust St, Olaf from their
perennial spot at the top oi the
Midwest Conierence baseball stand-
ings as the Oles won the four state
playoii (Minnesota, Wisconsin, 111.
inois, and Iowa) by topping Knox
in the finals, two games to none,
Grinnell cannot really be faulted ior
allowing st, Olaf to win a sixth
straight conierence title because the
Pioneers weren’t the lowa repre
sentative. Cornell was, so blame
them. (Don’t bother to ask why

_ Cornell was the lowa representa-

tivel),

The Pioneers linished the season
with two wins and six losses in
conference play and were 2-10 over
all. The two victories were at the
expense oi a dishelieving, but over—
rated Coe team and Cornell, Mike
Levy picked up both wins, one oi
them a shutout. He also pitched
fourteen innings oi shutout ball a-
gainst Coe heiore losing in the
iiiteenth.

best day of the season with a 3rd

The Pioneer’s luck turned all bad
the final day, however, Jim Briles,
who had run an excellent race to
qualify for the 880 final in 1:594
the first day, couldn’t overcome
sickness and the heat in the final,

final. Dave Wright qualified for the

Summed Up

Boyd’s squad were the contributi-
ons of several iresnman. Craig
Zippe,' Jon Haigh, and Brian Cook
were all regulars who distinguished
themselves both in the ileld and
at the plate. Zippe was the team's
leading hitter even despite being
hampered by injuries the latter part
or the season. klaigh was a solid
performer at the hot spot and was
a consistent hitter. Cook, when the
sun wasn't in his eyes, was an
impeccable fielder and a respecs
table hitter Otherspluses were the
pitching oi Levy, the slick fields
ing oi Wes Fugii in center—iield.
the solid play of Jeff Dick, and the
overall team spirir.

Both Levy and Dick, and catcher
Jack l-lamann will be gone next
year. These players will be miss-
ed, but losing only three players
will make iilling their positions
easier, This year's bench doesn't
otter much in the way or replace
