V; For Coe Meet /
‘ At Homecoming

For the‘ iii-st time since 1912
Grinncll college has a chance to
win three lootball games in a
row as the Pioneers travel to
Rapids Saturday. Like
Brown 6.: Co. Coc is trying to
work its way up irom the bots
tom oi thc conicrence, but so
with less success.

Last year the Kollawks were
Grinnell‘s only grid victim, as
the Pioneer gained a 6‘0 edge.
This season Coe has won one,
lost two, and tied one game. The
Kohawks play from a Trim-ma»

:tion and ieature a running game

In an attempt to rise in the
standings Coe has built its team
around sophomores who seem to
he improving with every game.

Charles Biermann, sophomore
fullback, is expccted to get in
the Coc contest. Bier-mann star—
red for Gl'innell in the Central
game, but has been out or the
lineup since with an ankle in-
Jury.

Duane Blough and Johnny
Bonyata are still on the iniured
list tor the Pioneers. and prob.
ably will not play tomorrow
Dave Dunlop and John Reimers
have been named co—captains ioi
the Coc game.

Tomorrows encounter will be
the homecoming battle for the
Kohawks and will mark the
thirtyesecond meeting between
the two schools. In previous
games the Pioneers have won 15,
lost 13, and tied 3. However,
there is nothing on the Pioneer
side of the ledger to equal the
55 it pasting Coc handed Grins
nell in 1914.
