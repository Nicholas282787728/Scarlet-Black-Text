"The White Male Advantage"

Let's talk.

I am a white male. I am
middle class. I am personally
responsible for the oppression of
every other racial, ethnic. and
sexual group in the world. For
my entire life I have enjoyed
advantages and privileges denied
to all other groups. I get better
jobs, earn more money, enjoy a

Clash - an introduction

While last week's article
seems to have been reasonably
coherent, this week I am going to
smrt on a new direction quite
different from that taken last
week. In forthcoming articles I
will be focusing primarily on the
upcoming Presidential election
instead of current events and
topical issues.

Matt Macho

But before you sigh and
resign yourself to hearing yet
MORE drivel about the
Democratic and Republican
candidates, note that I will be
approaching the election from a
variety of perspectives, some of
which you may never have heard
of or even thought about before.
Virtually everyone in Grinnell
seems to be at least vaguely
aware that an election is
forthcoming, and no doubt most
people can name all four of the
major candidates for President and
Vice-president. Some people are
even reasonably familiar with
major issues in the campaign,

. and some have decided who they
will vote for in November.

But how many of you are
aware that the Libertarian party is
also running a candidate, as are
several socialist and right-wing
parties? Are you aware of what
positions these parties take on
major issues? Can you name a

 

 

 

 

single third-party candidate?
"Why should I bother ﬁnding
out about these candidates, since I
would be deafened by the sound
of hell freezing over before any of
them win?", I hear someone ask.
But the criteria a candidate should
satisfy in order to get your
support is your belief in his or
her ability and/or your belief in
the issues upheld by that
candidate, not simply whether
that person can win. The
alternative is either to act on a
herd mentality, voting for
whichever demagoguc everyone
else supports with no regard for
his or her ability (or your own
intellect). or a retreat into
mindless apathy wherein you turn
your back on the democratic
process and allow others to decide
your political fate for you. Either
alternative is little better than
submission to fascism. If you
support the person you believe
in, more people will become
aware of that party or candidate.
increasing the likelihood of that
person gaining support and
eventually winning. Many
parties started off as small
movements of less than a dozen
people, and grew until they con-
trolled entire nations. Furlher~
more. winning the presidential
race is an extremely longrterm
goal for most of these parties.
Shorter-term goals are winning
local offices and increasing

 

awareness of the party. In this
Way, its candidates can eventually
be put on the ballot. as opposed
to competing as write-in
alternatives. Once some of these
goals have been accomplished, a
party can achieve significant
support and have a realistic
chance of Winning significant
offlcm.

In the next several weeks, I
will be concentrating on various
political movements removed
from the mainstream, some of
which are promoting their own
candidates, others which are
urging an election boycott.
Many of these people (Le. the
LaRouchians, neornazis, etc.) are
quite controversial. I guarantee
that you will not agree with all
or even most of the groups I will
be discussing, but in hearing and
considering what they have to say
you will become better informed,
and if you reject their message
you will have done so by a
conscious decision, not through

higher social status. and am
generally better off than everyone
else put together.

Let's get real.

I am no richer or poorer than
anybody else. I enjoy no special
social privileges. I ride the same
bus and drink from the same
fountain as everybody else. I am,
however, while and male.

Let me tell you a story. A
week or so ago I went to use the
bathroom on my floor and
discovered that someone had
written the word "assholes" in
under the word "men" on the sign
on the door. Now, I don't know
for sure, but I have a pretty good
idea that it was not a male person
who made this statement. I can
also state {or a fact that I don‘t
know every female in the world.
and am pretty sure they don't all
know me. I thought to myself.
"How is it possible that a single
female could personally know
every single male in the entire
world?" The concept amazed me.

Of course that isn't my point,
My point is that as a male, I was
stereotyped as an "asshole." Now,
let’s consider the driving force
behind every minority group
rights movement that ever
existed. If I‘m not mistaken.
fighting stereotypes has been
pretty high on cverybody's list.
How quick are those in the
business of combating
stereotypes to employ the very
means to which they are opposed.

I know what you are
thinking. You are saying Ihat
this is an isolated incident which
is not at all reflective of the way
things are at Grinnell. This is
just one such work of vandalism
that I have seen, however. In
fact, I believe that vandalized
signs are more common titan
untouched ones.

If it were just vandalized
signs I wouldn't worry about it
that much, but signs are the least
of my problems. How many
scholarships at this school are
reserved for women and
minorities? Can you imagine the

 

ignorance, Prepare for outrage if a single scholarship

was reserved exclusively for
white males? Or take another
example: equal opportunity
employment. Can you even
begin to comprehend the protests
that would erupt if a company
announced that it was going to
reserve a certain number of job
openings for white males,
regardless of the qualiﬁcations of
dtc applicants? Do you think
that I really love the idea of being
beaten out of a job purely on the
basis of my race and sex? Oh,
but then there's the white male
advantage that l have been
enjoying for so many years.

I have never oppressed any
minority group. I have never
done anything to prevent any
person from going as far as their
ability takes them. Yet, because
I am a white male, I am
presumed to have some inherent
advantage that must be offset by
having the odds stacked against
me. I went to a public school.
the same school that everybody
went to. I took the same classes,
I was graded on the same scale. i
took the same tests, and I had to
study just as hard. Will
someone please led me a exactly
what point in time I experienced
my advantage? 1 don't seem to
recall.

I think that true progress
cannot be made towards social
equality until all stereotypes are
abolished. The legitimate
women's group should make it
very clear that they are not the
same as the "male bashcrs,“ and
the minority rights groups should
stress that they hold no
prejudices. Until we destroy
stereotypes on both sides of the
fence, there will never be social
advancement. Only when
everybody is free of being
categorized will our society be
able to mature, Simply changing
the objects of the stereotypes
doesn't solve the problem.

Think about it.
