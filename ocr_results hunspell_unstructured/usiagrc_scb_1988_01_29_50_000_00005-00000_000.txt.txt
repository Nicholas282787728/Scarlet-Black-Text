15 Technology out
of Control?

Everybody has heard the ques-
tion before, “Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?” The problem
with the question, however, was
that up until now there hasn't been
a suitable answer. Both the
chicken and the egg had to come
irom each other. If you answered

John Newmark

. with a 10-minute monologue on
evolution you were considered an
egghead. However, that was up unr
til now. Now a few scientists have
nicely supplied us wiu-i an answer
An answer that might actually
even solicit a iew laughs. The
answer is: the chicken. When the
person asks you where the chicken
came irom, you can respond with:
a test tube, of course.

Scientists have recently
discovered a way to remove the
fetus of the Chicken from the
mother hen beiore it is laid along
with the egg. The chick can then be
“hatched" outside of the hen and
outside oi the egg. Therciore, we
have discovered that an egg is not
needed for a chicken to be born.
While this may answer the ques-
tion posed in the first sentence, the
process the scientists are going
through raises many serious pror
blems. First, in order to remove
the fetus of the chick, they had to
kill the mother hen, If there were
no other reason to kill the hen than
to raise chicks outside of eggs, that
would seem unnecessarily cruel.
However, there was another
reason. Unfortunately, that reason
unveils a technology that is highly
controversial, The scientists
wanted to find out if they could
manipulate the genes oi the ietus
while it was outside the body, and
if the chicken would still survive.
They were experimenting within
the irontier oi a newly discovered
science, genetic engineering.

For Centuries we have known
how to breed animals with the best
genes together in order to produce
better oiispring, but it takes an ex-
cessively long time to produce any
significant changes. Recently,

however, we have discovered what
speciiic genes go along with each
trait, and therefore have ventured
into the actual manipulation oi
genes. If we can find the gene that
can create a betteretastlng milk,
we can add it to the fetus of female
calves. That calf will produce the
better-tasting milk, and we won't
have to wait generations and
generations for the change,

We can produce better milk,
stronger cows, faster horses,
meatier pigs, and best oi all, we
can create entirely new animals.

Scientists are able to combine
several genes and create small
bacteria that never existed before.
Their hope is to create a species
that will eat sewage and trash, or
ones that will destroy viruses,
perhaps even iind a cure for the
common cold, However, there are
some important questions they
can't answer. What will these
bacteria eat once they are done
devouring what they were created
for? Some scientists say they will
just die from lack of nourishment,
but what it they adapt? Adaptation
is one of the major reasons humans
evolved irom lower organisms, so
what will stop these new species
irom evolving and adapting to new
environments?

How important are the viruses in
controlling animal populations? If
one species grows too large, could
this upset the food Chain? There
are too many questions, Perhaps
the most important is, is it worth
the risk?

Superbugs create obvious pro-
blems, Superanimals create
similar ones, it we change the
traits of these animals in order to
benefit ourselves in the short run.
what will the longrterm effects be?
But superbugs and superanimals
are the problems oi the present,
Even more frightening are the
possible problems oi the future,
such as superhumans. Researr
chers are presently discovering
the exact locations oi the genes
that cause many oi the genetic
diseases that iniect the population.

The Rude

Prior to the Christmas break, I'd
always had a sort oi iascinated
sympathy for those students who
were forced to spend their vaca~
tions on the deserted Grinnell came
pus because they were interna
tional students, residents oi the
town, or college employees Due to
a curious decision 1 made in
September, I, along with 12 other
mere mortals, got a taste oi the
hell that is Grinnell College during
the interim between New Year’s
Day and the beginning oi second
semester.

of a threeeweek hiatus at the Hotel

Before i attempt to elicit a
substantial amount oi pity irom

point out some positives that arose
irom this experience. We emerged
with a remarkable amount or team

that at that point any court of law
would have iound us not guilty of
aggravated assault (by reason oi
insanity, oi course). And although
our statistical periormance did not
meet our aspirations, we were
competitive in some games in
which we were basically overmat

stayed indoors most of the time,
but at that point we were eating all
our meals at the Longhorn, The
motivational high point or the day
came when it was time to check the
mail. The winds were sometimes
as high as 35 to 40 mph, but each at
us had a blind desire to trudge
through the arctic climate, hoping
we would be rewarded with a letter
