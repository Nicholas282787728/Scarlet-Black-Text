The news thatapassengertrain actu-
ally will come to Grinnell on Sunday,
Feb. 14 (no relation to Valentine’s
Day!) brings back happy memories of
days when it was possible to enter a
locomotive in one's hometown, relax
and arrive unscathed at destinations in
many directions.

The train on Sundaywill be a limited
train, ofcourse, consisting ofa rebuilt
passengercarandalocomotivebelong—
ing to the loWa Interstate Railroad.
Purpose of the expedition is to call
attention to the need for legislative
funding for Iowa‘s locally based sci—
ence and technology centers, speciﬁ-
cally the Iowa City Area Science Cen~
ter. The train will run from Iowa City
to Des Moines, stopping in Home-
stead, Grinncll and Newton.

Theexpedltion recallsaslmilarevent
some years ago when a trainload of
legislators came to Grinnell frorn Des
Moines at the invitation ofthe board of
the Iowa Peace Institute to hear a pro—
gram on the advantages of that new
organization in Grinnell.

At that time there was no grand new
restaurant to greet them but efforts
were made to spruce up the old depot
and legislators weretakentothe peace
institute for a program.

It Was a classic case ofbringing the
mountain to Mohammed.

One of the legislators at that time
was Jean Lloyd Jones of Iowa City, a
peace institute founder and an early
board member.

Jones, still active in public affairs, will
be the honorary trainmaster.

The train on that previous occasion
was met by groups of local residents, a
scene which is expected to be repeated
here Sunday.

In the much earlier days when train
travel was the rule rather than the ex»
ception, one could hop aboard a train
and arrive a short time later in Des
MoinesorOmaha iftravellng west and
Iowa City or Chicago iftraveling east

It was relaxing to watch the scenery
slip by to the clickity clack of the
wheels, to dine in the dining ear, al-
ways with a ﬂower on the table, and to
arrive rested at one‘s destination.

Students arrived at Grinnell College
by train and Grinnell students went to
their respective colleges by train.

One Grinnell College president, Dr.
Samuel Stevens, was known for pute
ting on his pajamas and bathrobe at
home and taking the midnight train
into Chicago in a sleeper car to arrive
in the morning to carry on his business.

Around recalls taking a group of
small children to Newtcnagood many
years ago on the last run ofthe Rock

the possibility of restoring local pas-

The effort to encourage more buyr

for example, the fact that certain

added.

Aplus forthebusiness community
is the fact that the Chamber now has

“Gina Miller is doing a greatjob
for us," he said. “Evidence of that
was the successful warehouse sale
