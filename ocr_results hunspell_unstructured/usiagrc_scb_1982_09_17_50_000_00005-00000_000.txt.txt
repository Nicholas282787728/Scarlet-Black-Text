) o the Editor:

in your article on the common sense of a
ecurity force you implied that SGA

embers argued against an inevitable in~
unction. That claim depreciates the intent
if the actual debates. No one argued that

e should not have security. We did,
owever, fear the administration‘s unruly
mposition of a plan which would jeoparr
l'ze many student freedoms. The students
.imply refuse to be ignored.

Your article stated that people “are

asting their time and SGA time” by
niscussing whether the administration
hould have consulted and confided in
mint Board earlier. I retort that it is never
= waste of time to discuss furthering com-

unication between the administration
nd Joint Board. In fact, Joint Board had
o postpone discussion for a week in order
hat Mr. Tederman could come and clarify
he administration‘s position.

0n the issue of security, only discussions
f the students’ needs and the administra-
ion's demands can bring about a com-
uromise congenial to both parties. It is im-
erative that the administration and the
tudents make a conscious effort to be in-
olved with each other on this and other
ssues concerning student interests. 7

0 the Editor:
In response to the article and editorial on
he Judicial Council ruling on the student
he struck a fire alarm, all the facts were
not presented. The fire alarm was set off
lay someone else who did it, as the editor
-ut it, “for .iun." A string of fire
rackers caused the fire alarm to go
ff. These firecrackers were attached to
candle which was lit and eventually
urned down to the fuse, igniting it at apr
uroximately 2 am. We believe that this
ct, lighting the firecrackers, is a much
ore serious act than the other commit»
ed, punching a fire alarm. According to
he editor, lighting the fire (vandalism) is

ference was the degree at guilt you wished
to feel.

As a social and gossip center Burling
was the Waldorf of them all (although
designed like 3 Howard Johnson’s). My
favorite part of Hurling, of course, was the
south study hall, more affectionately
khown as the playroom. The playroom was
almost the size of all of the first floor of the
forum, it was the nerve center of the
library social scene. One quick glance
around the room and you could find anyone
who was anyone. As a gossip center it was
impeccable, simply because if Jane and
John were discussing their newest pro-
blem, emotion or child the whole of the
playroom could hear. You see, Burling
was designed opposite of most libraries:
sound could travel completely uninter-
rupted throughout the whole building. In
my first two years of studying in Hurling I
heard of hundreds of breakups, many at—
tempted suicides, one pregnancy, one
abortion and three losses of virginity. Con-
versation was Burling’s greatest asset, not
its books.

Yes, the design of Burling bordered on
the absurdity. The mezlanine or the
Shakespearian balcony to the playroom
was more of a launchpad for wayward
airplanes than an individual Carrel study

“inexcusable" but punching the fire alarm
is ‘fespecially idiotic.” Please explain the
logic behind that. How can punching a fire

alarm (not damaging, just punching) be ,

worse than lighting a fire?! 1

Granted, tampering with a fire alarm is
a Serious offense, but considering that the
alarm was not damaged in any way, and
the fact that mch floor averaga about five
alarms, the punishment seems quite inapr
propriate. For so worth of damage, the
sentence seems very harsh. Doesn’t it
seem more logical for the accused to be
placed on conduct probation? You quote
the constitution as saying: “Conduct pro-
bation is a recognition of a very serious
lack of cooperation in citizenship or a
serious or repeated violation of a college
regulation.“ Since, as the chairperson
stated later, the defendant had ”a
slight past history . . . of problems with fire
alarms,” that seems to us to constitute a
repeated violation; therefore, conduct pro
bation seems appropriate. If the Judicial
Council can kick someone off campus for a
lousy $6 damage, I suppose I should have
been expelled from school for the $15
damage to my room last ymr. We believe
that the punishment should fit the crime.

We feel that the Judicial Council is show-
ing its personal prejudices in that they,
and especially Dean Tederman. have
finally found a method of getting back at
someone whom they have not liked ever
since they got here. if this is the way our
campus legal action is going to work, then
why bother having a Judicial Council at
all. — Questioning justice, John Egan Jr.
and J. Scott Raecker

The Editor Replies:

Punching a fire alarm is as serious an of-
fense as lighting a fire because that fire
alarm is supposed to alert people to the
danger. The offender was sentaiced for his
actions, not for the amount ofdamage he
caused.

area; how can you study sitting next to a
virtual rubber room?

Everything has changed now that Burl-
ing has been transformed into a library.
I'll miss the absurdities, too many to men
tion. (Who can forget the clogs on the tile
floors, the telephone conversations in the
basement, white table tops with floures~
cent lights, metal chair legs that erked
across the tile, pencil Sharpeners that
made everyone pause from their work?)
Some of the absurdities bordered on the
hysterical. My favorite was the foyer in
front of the budding which blended the out-
side noise with the library noise.

All of this proves the point that if you can
study at Grinnell you can study anywhere,
Even when the construction started and
the library was full of cursing, singing con
struction workers there was never a
significant drop in the amount of people
that studied there; we were so used to
noise.

‘I went into the new library and felt
somewhat lost; I couldn’t hear anything.
There was carpet, the playroom was sec-
tinned off, the mezzanine extended and
the foyer gone. Instead there were these
little padded Study cells called Carrels with
everyone separated from each other —

, ,sob, sob. So now where do wejgo for a

To the Editor:

As hall presidents who sit on Joint Board
we are, of course, very pleased to see that
mis year the 5&3 apparently intends to
devote a large amount of coverage to SGA.
We do feel, however, that there are certain
journalistic responsibilities which the 5&3
has failed to live up to.

In last week’s issue, an editorial ap-
peared which stated that hall presidents
who raised objections to the proposed per-
manent security force for alleampus par-
ties were “wasting their time and SGA
time." As the presidents who raised some
of these objections, we feel that the 5&3
failed to fully understand the issue. There
are serious issues involved here that
everyone at last week's Joint Board
meeting understood, yet the SkB ap-
parently does not understand and has not
made much of an effort to understand. if
the editor had taken the time and trouble
to speak to any of us prior to writing the
editorial, it would have been clear that we
were not “wasting SGA time.’I We wﬂ‘e
merely attempting to gather more facts
about an issue that will greatly affect all
campus parties at Grinnell.

On the other hand, maybe we were
wasting time in a sense, because the ad-
ministration certainly didn’t seem to want
to give us much choice in the matter. Joint
Board had to accept the whole proposal,
which includes paying (out of SGA funds)
security guards at least $1.35 an hour for
work that was done for approximately $2
an hour last year. Joint Board can still
refuse to fund the plan, but we are told that
this would result in serious repercussions.

At any rate, many of our constituents
are concerned about this issue, and we feel
that it is our function as Joint Board reps
to convey these concerns to SGA. if the
5&3 feels that our pursuit of this matter in-
volves a serious waste of time, then it
would be well advised to make certain that
it lully understands all aspects of the issue
before taking a stand one way or the other.

lege owned), Amy I-‘raenkel (off-campus

To the Campus Community:

This letter is being submitted with the in-
tention of clearing up the confusion sur-
rounding The Pub membership drive of
1982. This confusion appears in stem from
a general misunderstanding about the
organization and general operation of The
Pub Club, Inc.

The Pub is incorporated under the laws
of Iowa as a nonprofit club owned and
operated by its student, faculty and staff
membership. The day-today operations of
The Pub are directed by The Pub
manager, who is in turn supervised by the
Board of Directors. This Board of Direc-
tors is comprised of three Studenw and
three faculty members who are elected by
The Pub membership.

The purchaser of a Pub membership is,
in effect, investing in a non-profit business,
a business desinged to give its members a
place to relax and escape the pressures of
academia. The money invested by
members provides special events
throughout the semester, such as student
and non-student bands, dime draws and
imported beers, as well as low prices on
beer and soft drinks.

The Pub has just undergone major
renovations, the total cost of which was in
excess of $16,000. The investments of its
members over the past 10 years were used
to pay for the majority of the renovation.
The rest of the money was borrowed
from the college.

The continued investment of The Pub's
membership is essential for the continued
operation or The Pub. We hope that this let
ter will help the student body better
understand the necessity of its participa»
tion in The Pub via memberships. ~ The
Board of Directors of The Pub Club, Inc,
Paul Cohen, Manager.

congressman

Brad Vander Linden

In an era of poweriul special interests
and wealthy political action committees
(PACs) that bloat congressional cam-
paign war chests to degrees never dreams
ed of 10 years ago, Congressman Neil
Smith (Dem. la) is a refreshing change.

Most of today's campaign staffs are
highly organized political affairs captive
to rich special interests whose goals don’t
always have the vast public good in mind.
The major force that has made represen-
tative government such a success
throughout American history is the educa-
tional value two intelligent, knowledgeable
candidates competing for the same office
can bring to a voting constituency. In Old
fashioned congressional districts it takes
only a small staff and a little money for the
candidate to travel the small towns in a
district, presenting his views to audiences
at town meetings, church suppers. and
county fairs.

Neil Smith, dean of the Iowa Congres-
sional Delegation, w s first elected in 1958
from Iowa's fourt district, returning
every two years with large majorities of
the vote. Smith, who has always resisted
putting together an intensely political
organization which tends to insulate a can-
didate from the true sentiments of the
voters, epitomizes the idea of the people’s
congressman. Every two years at election
time, Smith sailies forth in his car, usually
alone, Visiting the main streets and
neighborhoods of his district, pressing the

ﬂesh and talking mostly one to one, face to .

face with individuals, trying to assess

from them what kind of job he is doing in
Washington and what they would like to
see him doing in Washington.

A politician with no ambition for a
higher office, Smith concentrates totally
on serving the people of his district. The
ideal of what a congressman should be, he
is a knowledgeable source of information
about the issues that originate from
Washington concerning the people of his
district.

On September 20, a group of Saudi
students studying at a small Iowa junior
college were attacked and roughed up by
unknown assailants in Ottumwa. a small
southern Iowa community. Smim express-
ed outrage at the xenophobic acts of
violence so uncharacteristic of normally
friendly Iowans.

“To me those actions are untypical or
Iowans," Smith said in a phone interview
with the Des Moines Register,

“1 was embarrassed that it occurred in
the district I represent. . . People in Iowa
usually don‘t react with such prejudice."
said Smith.

The Campus Democrats praise his
defense of basic human rights extended to
every guest of the United States, 00,1.
gressman Smith has proved to be the peor
ple’s congressman over his 24 years as
Iowa’s representative from the fourth
district, and we endorse and support his
bid for a 13th term in Congress. It’s ironic
that his Republican opposition is running
on the slogan that their candidate is the

. realpeople’s congressman.
