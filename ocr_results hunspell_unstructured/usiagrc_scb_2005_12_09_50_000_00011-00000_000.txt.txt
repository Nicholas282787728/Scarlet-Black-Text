Women’ s b- ball starts With win and loss

3v LOLA GARCIA

The Gtinnell womens basketball
team broke even over the weekend,
opening its conference season with a
win over Beloit and a loss againsr Rie
pon.

Last Friday, the Pioneers trounced
the Buccaneers,ﬁnishing the game with
66 points, to Beloir's 43. The women
took the lead early in the game, going
into the halfw-ith a score of23-15.

The women held their lead after
halftime, pulling ahead to nearly double
Beloit’s score in the first few minutes of
the second half.

Although the Buccaneers improved
their play during the second half and
closed the gap during the last few min-
utes of the game, it was not enough to
catch up to the Pioneers.

The women were at the top of their
game oftenslvely and defensively, forc-
ing 20 Beloit turnovers and scoring 15
threeepointers during the game.

Hannah Wolf ’08 had 15 points
from behind the are and was the top—
seorer orrhe game with 17 poinrs.

The Beloit game was eneourag-
ing for Wolf because the team had
two losses to the Buccaneers last year.
Grinnell was also ranked behind Belmt
in the preseason conference standings.

“it was great for us to come out and
win our first conference game," said
Wolf. “It gives us a lot of hope for whar
we can do this season."

Katie Bowen oo scored 12 poinrs
contributing eight assists and bringing
down seven rebounds

Bowen let the team in points the
following night against the Ripon Red
Hawks, putting up a total of 24 points,
12 of them from threcepo‘lnters. BOW’
en also had seven assists, three rebounds
and two steals on the game.

Wolfhad a total of 18 points, also
making tour from beyond rhe arc dur—
ing the game.

The Pioneers could not quite tops
ple the visiting Red Hawks, who pulled
away with a 76 to 61 victory.

Bowen had mixed feelings abour
her performance. “It's hard because at
the end of rhe year it doesn't matter
your personal record, [what] matters
is your win, loss record," she said. “It's
frustrating because you do your best to
help your team, and sometimes you still
don’t win.”

Bowen felt that this weekend's
games were helpful in laying out the
rest of the season’s conference play.

“Beloit as a team is kind of in the
middle, so we know we can eompere in
the conference," she said. “[The Ripon
game] gave us an idea ofwhat we need
to do."

The Pioneers played a noneconfcre
ence game against Luther College last
Tuesday, losing to the Norse 67-82.

The team has its next home game
tomorrow, against Cornell College.
