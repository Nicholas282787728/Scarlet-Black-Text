When Roll is Called in the Class of 1612

College administrators got gray hair last in thelold
days — back when men were silly hols, pretty
clothes and swords at their sides ~ For the class of
1612 was really rough, tough and hard-to-handle.
in case you don’t believe it, just give a once—over
to these prizes item the ”Academia sive speculum
vitae scholasticae" ("Mirror of Scholastic Life" to
you Lalin-lorgettets) published in 1612. That was
in both A. D. and B. C., you know — Anno

0 Classroom conduct hasn’t changed much since the latter part of
the 14th Century when Henricus de Alemania lectured at the
famous School ol Bologna (no gag). Boredom, gossip, laughter,
weariness and argument are all present in the student body. The
scholarly lecturer sits almost on the ceiling, a symbol ol his in—
tellectual superiority and 7 also — a good vantage point during
exams. Some of the students are unshaven because good old
Bologna hadn't won a badminton match since early in the cen—
tury. (Miniature painting by Laurentius de Voltalina)

0 University students "sending" lot the benefit at the campus queen. These
boys would even move pianos out into the yard tor a chance to sing love songs
to their Lady Fair. All this was baclt in 1612 —— and il you don't think swing
was riding the strings even then, you're “icky".

0 Boy, did they go alter the lreshmenl The tortures oi the dungeons were given a real first—
hand study by the newcomers a and they often studied so hard they didn't live to put
their new-lound knowledge to good use.

 

 

 

 

 

 

O A candid canvas shot talren just 326 years ago of a couple of sophomores letting oil steam in a
little dueling match. Not many students "united out of schools in those days but lots at them were
carried out. It was all good, clean college lun, though no matter what the cost ~ and they did wear
such pretty clothes!

 

0 Here are the racqueteers oi the class of ‘1? practicing for the Finals
oi the National Intercollegiate Indoors. Court tennis was a bit dillerent
in those days; the rules were more complicated and you had to hit that
oval painted on the back wall lot some esoteric reason. The tennis balls
sprinkled around the court and in the basket bear a suspicious resem-
blance to fruit but it's probably just the artist's lault. Or should we call
it a "fruit—tault"?
