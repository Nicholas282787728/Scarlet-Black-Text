Fall data show attrition increase

by Kim Eckart

The attrition statistics for the
1988 Fall semester reveal the
dismissal of five students and the
suspension of 13, an increase
from the Spring ‘88 total of three
dismissals and two suspensions.

According to Assistant Dean
of the Faculty Ian Czechowski.
these numbers do not display a
definite trend. For example. four
students were dismissed and seven
were suspended after the 1987
Fall semester. compared to the
Spring ‘87 total of 14 dismissals
and four suspensions. “if we
continue with the high numbers.
then there would be a concern."
Czechowski said. “but the num-
bers are actually a lot better than
they were a few years ago.”

committee reviews the case and
informs the student and his or her
adviser and parents. Depending
on the case. the penalties include
warnings, academic probation,
suspensron. and dismissal. Sus-
pension is defined as a limited
termination of student status.
whereas dismissal is lhc complete
termination of the student‘s rciav
tionship with the college. “The
comtnittee always reviews each
case as a serious matter,"
Czechowski said.

The increase in suspensions
and dismissals rs not due to a
lack of notification lo the neces-
sary parties, Czechowski said.
However. in some cases it may
be difficult to give sufficient no~
lice. “In rare cases where a stu-
dcnt doesn‘t turn in papers or
doesn‘t show up for a final.

notification is difficult." said
Czochowski. ”Some warnings
are greater than others, but we try
to catch students before serious
action needs to be taken."
Czechowski also clarified the
student handbook's rCViSttXI policy
on academic honesty. The rcviv
sions involve a clearer definition
of the judicial proce . Specifi-
cally. if any suspicious work is

instructor. When a student is

traditional penalty, the final dCClr
