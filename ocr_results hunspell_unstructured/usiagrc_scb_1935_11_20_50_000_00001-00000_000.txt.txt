Stowe Sees
Possibility
of War

Says Conflict

to Start \in Europe

General

in Five Years

“Europe is heading towards an-
other general war and one in which
the odds are 19 to one that the
United States wrll become in-
volved." asserted Leland Stowe,
foreign correspondent for the New
York Herald-Tribune, in his ad-
dress last night on the “Ethiopian
Situation as a Menace to World
Peace."

The general European conflict,
which will probably occur within
five years, will he an outgrowth of

the great struggle now in progress,

between Italy and Great Britain
for control of the Mediterranean
sea, Italy has long been dominated
by the British fleet due to the pen»
insular position of the ltalians, and
now that rising power is objecting
to this domination, the speaker
pointed out.
ll. 5. to Get Involved

In discussing the possibilities of
the United States being involved,
Mr. Stowe expressed the belief that
this was inevitable unless the
Americans were willing to forego
all profit from war and would re-
frain from having any form of
trade with any of the belligerents.
It will be a question of whether or
not America is willing to sacrifice
a few billion dollars for two or
three years, or willing to pay a
huge sum, which will make the 55
billion dollars of the last war look
small, at the end of the conflict.

Mermen to Begin

Daily iii-11s 'm
After Vacation

Daily practices for varsity and
freshman swimmers will com-
mence Dec. 3, Frank Luonra. Swlme
ming coach. announced yesterday.

The tankmen will practice Tues<
day and Thursday afternoons at
4:30 o'clock; Monday, Wednesday
and Friday afternoons at 5 o'clock;
and Saturday at 10 a. m. Varsity
men have been working out three
times a week during the past two
months, in preparation for the
start of the swimming season
after the Thanksgiving holidays.

“No definite meets have been ar-
ranged as yet for the 1935-36 var~
sity schedule," Luoma stated, “but
Grinnell will probably have home
meets with lowa State, Gustavus
Adolphus and Carleton, while plans
are also being made to secure
meets with Michigan State at East
Lansing, Mich, and Washburn uni-
versity at Topeka, Kans."

What’s Wrong With Grinnell?
\tht‘s wrong with the Grinncll football team?
we would like to know, .

\vVith but one more gadne leit, Grinllell is about to bring to it
close another—l not (lisastrollS, (hell in: least a mediocre seasoni
'l‘o (late the record is tllrec \ 5, four losses and one tiHrtainly
nothing to brag about when it is considered that the last two games
have resulted ill ii tie and loss ‘0 teams which were supposedly wooll—
cr than Grinnell. This constant grinding in the dust of the Grinnell
reputation by teams which hmc never Set the football World on fire
rs getting irksonre.

However, the question is, why such a. mediocre season? The
schedule has been fairly well balanced, with Grilulcll playing both
large crud small schools, yet we lose to both.

ls lack of material the cause of these losses? It doesn’t seem
so, for this year (or the first time ill three years, Grillnellilms had a
liil'gejuotball squad reporting for practice, yet we merrily, continue
to lose. l

ls tllerc a lock 01 spirit which causes Grillllell to {all before all
lootboll opponents? Perhaps this is so now, but at the opening of
the season, there was a fine morale. which, however, has been seri-
ously undermined, as is evidenced by the decision ol seVErnl of the
reserves to cease reporting for practice. Why this has happened
cannot be fully ascertained as yet.

The real answer seems to lie in the [act ﬂmt first. Grillnell’s M:-
tnck. which hiﬂ'nys’toﬂk to the air lanes, was centered around one
main; and second. the team has never Showed signs of being thor-
oughly drilled on the fundamentals of the game—blocking inid tack-
ling.

IL is unfortunate that any team should center its attack around
one man, [or disaster is certain in case of injury and Such was the
case with Grinnell, hence we continue to lose.

It is likewise unfortunate that Grinnell never hm; been thoroughv
1y drilled In blocking and tackling, No one would accuse Grlnnell o!
displaying a thorough knowledge of fundamentals, in fafct at times
the play can only be described as being lousy. Why this weak tack-
ling and blocking has marked the play of Grinneu for the last three
years is more than we can explain.

One fact remains, if the present athletic set—up cannot produce
teams that will make at least a fairly respectable showing. then it
is time that a shake—up was made. Three years is a long time dur-
ing' WMCII to be represented by mediocre tenths, Dnd either we should
be represented by winning teams or- we might as well drop varsity
sports.

We have always ranked with the highest, size notwithstanding,
and if we cannot do this, then why ask men to put in long hours of
practice when the repuiaﬂon of Grinnell \vlll receive just another
beating. This season is Just about over, and judging from the past.
it is time for a. change. If the ndmlnistraﬁon does not Want teams
that can will in strong competlllon, if the policy of the school Ls to
be one of no cooperation with the athletic department, than we had
better begin booking junior college teams, At least the players .will
have fun then, and the school will stand an even chance of winning

Cage Drills
to Begii

Coach 'Asks Men to Report
Monday Afternoon

season

Practice for the 1935-36 basket-
ball season will start Monday aft-
ernoon, John C. Truesdale, varsity
coach, .announced yesterday.

Grinnell's hopes of winning early
season games received a severe jolt
two weeks ago when Julius Bauer,
football halfback and regular cenr
ter in basketball, incurred arup-
tured kidney which will force him
to remain away from the cage drills
until after the Christmas holidays,
according to Trucsdalc.

To Miss Bauer-

“Bauer’s loss may be the differ-
ence between defeat and victory in
the Loyola tilt,” Tluesdale said
"Last year Grinnell beat the Chie
cago team on their own floor by a
narrow margin but the absence of
Bauer may change this. This
coupled with the short practice
period may be too much of a handi—
cap for the team,

“On the whole. this year's team
will be slightly less effective than
that of last year, due to the loss
of three of the team's most depend.
able scorers, Mason. who averaged
seven or eight points a game,
DuMont, who averaged five points,
and Frye, whose average was four
markers."

All Teams Stronger.

Truesdale expects the rest of the
Valley circuit teams to be stronger
than they were last year. Drake
seems to be the strongest, having
lost few men by graduation, while
Creighton will present its usual
strong team, being led this year by
Emil "Box". Englebreuon, veteran
cager, who is considered one of the
most outstanding players in the
conference.
