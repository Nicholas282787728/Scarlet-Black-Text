Students spend week at Tama settlement

By Sharyn Obsatz

A culture torn between the forces
of modernization and tradition
awaited 20 Grinncll students and
seven Grinnelt faculty members at
the Mesquakic Native American
Settlement near Tama, Iowa.

As pan of a minority recruit-
ment program sponsored by the
Native American Interest Group
(NAIG),participantsspentﬁvcdays
on the settlement, presenting
workshops on various coltege»re-
lated subjects such as Theatre.
Chemistry, Contemporary Native
American Literature. and Creative
Writing, Students also assisted
classes at the settlement schools
and nearby schools in Tama and the
neighboring
town ofToledo.

While the
M e s q u a k i c
youth learned
about different
aspects of cola
Iege life, the
Grinnell par»
t t c i p a n t s
learned about
thehistoryofthe
Mesquakietribe
and the effects
of moderniza-
tion on its cut-
turc.‘ Many
went into the week knowing little
about Native Americans.

“i‘ve never come across them
before," said Doer Gurung. “l've
only seen them in movies. and I
know that’s not how it is.“

shops. the Mesquakie community
held a potluck dinner and a pow-
wow in honor of the Grinnelt par
ticipants.

Nonetheless. during the week,
the Grinnelt students also were
made aware of some negative Nae
tive American sentiments toward
whitepeople. The Mesquakicterrn

One Mesquakie elder shared
stories aboutbcing scntby the gov;
emrncnt to boarding school and
about the lessons she learned there.

“I was taught that when you go
into someone's home, you don't
just grab ev»
erything, but
what did the
white people
do. " she asked,
“I guess only
the white
people can act
that way.“

A n o t h c r
Native Ameri-
can, Jonathan
Buffalo, de-
scribed white
Americans as
“a good peo-
ple", but caur
tioncd Lhat“they can be real bad.“

“We’ve seen how ruthless they
can be." he added. referring to the
1840's when the Mesquakies were
forced by the U.S. government to
move to Kansas. As woodland In»
dians, they were not used to sur-
vival on the plains of Kansas, and
thousands perished.

In 1850. many of the surviving
Mcsquakies bought the land on
which the settlement stands today.
A few Americans. such as Joshua
GrinneII. helped the Mesquakies
keep their land by petitioning the

government to allow the tribe to
stay in lowa.

All the land on the settlement is
owned by the tribe. and they pay
taxes to the governmenton theland.

mcnt needs only pick out the land

As no individuals can sell their
land. communal ownership also
provides protection against the
buying up of settlement land by
outside parties. The Mesquakies
are very concerned about minimiz-
Ing the inﬂuence of outside forces
on their culture.

“Sometimes wearctiberatwhen
politics are concerned,“ said a Na-
tive American journalist, Elliott
Ricehill, “but we are conservative
when it comes to protecting our
tribe and our traditions." But even
with efforts to preserve tradition
and control outside inﬂuence, the
settlement is modernizing.

“We’re changing, losing our
Ianguageand our independence. but
we can’t stop ourselves from
changing,” saidBuffalo. “Modem»
ization is like a drug! We are no
longer self-sufficient. Ninety per-
cent of our food is bought at the
store. We can't live without T.V "

Buffalo fears this change. Clix

the effect that he saw this having on
the tribe’s culture,

“In changing, we lose our spirir

the gods are going to the spiritual

them. When the last spirit leaves.
the Great Spirit will say ‘These

know howlohg wehave,”headded.

Amidst the struggle to preserve
their heritage. Native Americans
must also struggle to survive in
American society. Many residents
on the Mesquakie settlement make
a living olt the bingo hall they run.
Others sell crafts. Many young
men and Women go off to nearby
cities such as Cedar Rapids to find
work.

One Mesquakie said it was cru-
cial that the government help Na-
tive Americans who are trying to
further their education. A repre-
sentative from the South Tama
County School district suggested
that Native American students
might be aided most by increased
funding and scholarships.

While NAIG members have
been so far unsuccessful in gaining
increased landing from Grinnell
College for Native American stu-
dents, they will continue their efa
forts and hope that the workshops
encouraged Mesquakic youth to
consider college.

Grinnell student Mike Galaty

hoped the week would provide“the ‘
little push" the kids needed to get
serious about college.

“I really think all these kids have '
a lot of potential to succeed in col~
lege or whatever they do, but they
don’t realize how much work it
takes to put their dreams into ac
tion. We want toencourage them to
taketheirdreamsseriotlsly,”hesaid.

Tom Berger, one of the ma
ordinators ofNAiG, explained that
the program was intended to dem-
onstrate strong student initiative on
the issue of Grinnell College’s re-
cruitmentofNativeAmericans. He
thanks the Rosenﬁeld Committee
and the Office of the President for
funding the program and the
settlement‘s J OM Committee for
their support.

In his opinion, the program was
successful.

“The workshops worked. The
kids camcand had fun. The parents
were happy. Thepottuck and powr
wow was more than we ever ex-
pected. I would do it again. no
question, right away. right now.”
