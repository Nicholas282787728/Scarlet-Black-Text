Inendly atmosphere ol the school Aller set»

are the two basrc iorms ol racrsm en-
countered at ctrnnell LIVlng rn Crlllmell and
attending classes here lot iour years has
taught me a great deal aborrt IlVlng in a
society where race rs an rssue.

Cnnnell rs a mrcrocosm ol socrety. I must
always remember that racrsm rs eyerywhere
r you cannot escape ll ln a small lawn and
you cannot escape rt rn a city Anything em
perlenced rn Grrnnell can he and wrll be eke
perienced anywhere The racial tensrons orr
campus are subtle — you cannot potnt to
one person and say that he or she rs racist,
you cannot pornt at any given modem and
say that rt rs a ractst act, open hos rty dues
not exrst on Cnnnell's campus the racrsnr rn

The Black conimunrty In Crllmell rs sard to
be a separatrst one a ridiculous accusatron
First or all, black students at Cilnnell are
Irrends, Ius| like certain groups or whrte
students are lrrends Secondly, we all live rn
the dorms and rnIeract darly wrth nonsBlacks
Flnally, rl we warned to separate ourselves

Also that month the south Alrrcan Support

agreed to meet again wrth the group in
May), and Natronal Pllbllr Itatlto's Susaw

not want to thrnk ol these obvrous Incons
srstencres. they would rather look at so
Irrends eating dinner together, all or whom
happen to be Black, and say that they are
separating themselyes Do they bother to
look at all ol the other tables and notrce that
they are occupred by whrte studentsz No.
Amerlcan socrety Is a vrsual one — people
respond only to what they see; they do not
thrnk about the srtuatton or the ctr
cumstances surroundmg that event.

5rrnrlarly, there is the problem caused by
people saying that one or two people repre
sent the entrre Black community at ,Crrnnell
Ihts is simply not the case. Ihrs type ol
generalrzatron rs another lorm ol lns|ltullon2|
racrsm Crlnrlell accepts students lrom a
varrety ol backgrounds — the school’s com.
mrttment to dryersrty, since all ol the black
students come 1mm varied backgrounds it Is
rmpossrble lor any one person to represent
the other thirty people's leelrngs; to belreve .
thrs rs possrble rs absurd

The cry goes up that the Concerned slack
Sludems (CBSl, the Black students unron on
campus, ‘ls a separatrst organizatron and that
the Black Culmlal Center rs an exhrbttron or
that Semimem. this too ls a tallacy, cas ek-

Crmnell and il selves as an educallonal

through the two malol weekends rI sponsors
each year, brings Black cultural and polrtrcal
awareness to the campus and communrty at
large An organrzatron wrth these goals and
asptranons ln mrnd cannot be a separailst

I do not want to sound like artnnell rs a
place where racrsm, overt or subtle, runs
rampant — that rs not the case, howevel,
one must be made aware ol what
generalrtatrons do to people and how when
you make race an Issue, rt clouds over and
debases many relatronsht s.

I have talked about the rnstrtutronal racrsm
on campus and there'rs a leerenl lorm oI It
in town The type ol Incident I encountered
my lrrst day ol school is extremely rare, but
sonrethmg much more drsturbrng happens
tlarly — people state when a Black person
walks rnto town or walks Into a store, peas
ple actually stop, turn, look and then stare
IOvaously, everyone does not state, but It
happens every day.) One store owner would

Or how about llbrary cartel mock-ups; the

Walker and lrm Iederman decrded to keep
the health center on'campus due to high
costs, student opposrtron, and the hosprtal's
mabrlrty to provrde the level ol servrces the
college wanted.

-do not understand the reasoning behrnd this

type ot actron 7 there have been Islack peo
ple rn Grrnnell practrcally srnce the college
has been here, there are two sucesslull black

I don't want to sound paranord, or make
Grlnnell, lowa look like the pedect locatron
for the next regional Ku Klux klan meetrng,
There are several people In town who are
supportrve or Black students and who enyoy

many Issues

I'm leaving Cnnnell but not wrth any rll
Ieehngs about my experlence here I love
Ihrs school but as wrth everythrng rm»
proyemeno can be and should be made.
The solution to the problems caused by in
strtutronal racrsm rs a simple one, carryrng rt
through rs the hard part It you open up the
lrnes ol communrcatron and people raise
questions, demand answers and talk to each
other about then tears, hopes, Ieelrngs, so
many ol the problems would be solved I
know that that ts a very optrrntsttc Leslre talk-
rng butl have to believe that there rs hope.
Grinnell has so many drherent krnds ol peo
ple here, we should all open up and take
advantage ot what we could learn lrom
other people

I have learned a lot about people at ctrn.
nell l have learnad that most Iowans are not
racrsts and that what I had once interpreted
as racrsm was actually rgnorance We learn
ed Ihat not only do other people have to
open up to cultural drversrty, but so do I. l
have came a long way In tour years. Crlnnell
College has been as they say, ”a place to-
grow,"

trnally, at then meeting tn May, the
