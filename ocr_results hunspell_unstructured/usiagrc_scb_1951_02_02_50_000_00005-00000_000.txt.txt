aggravation of a football knee
injury might end his basketball
days. Considered by Coach John
Pﬁltsch “the best rebounder m
the Midwest Conference,” the
Gates affiliate’s ambition has
come true; he is playing once
more.

Big Bob, who describes hlm-
self as the Union house mother,
believes this year's Pioneer
squad is the best team he has
ever played on. He thinks the
sophomore crop is outstanding
