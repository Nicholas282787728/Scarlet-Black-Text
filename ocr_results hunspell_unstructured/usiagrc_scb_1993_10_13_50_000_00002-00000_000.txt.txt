Mental illness
has warning signs. too.

Withdrawal from Social
acllvltles. Excessive anger.
These could be the first
warning signs of a mental
illness. Unfortunately. most of
us don't rccogntze the signs.
Which is tragic. Because
mental illness can be treated.
In fact. 2 out of 3 people who
get help. get better.

MOVIE REVIEWS:

By Riva Sharples

you are venturing outofGrinnell
IZverFall Break. youmightwantto
make time to see the newly re-
leased movie, Dcmﬂflifﬁll Man. The
movrc is an actionrpackcd fulut-‘tsuc
cop and criminal ﬁlm, with an unusual
twtst. The ﬁlm pits cop superman
John Stockton (Sylvester Stallone)
against “the 2 lst century's most rulllr
lcsscriminal,"Simon Phoenix (Wesley
Snipes). The film opens in the year
1996 in the mitlstofall-out warfare in
south-central Los Angcles. Caughtup
in the excitement of arresting Snipes,
Stallonc's chamctcr is accused of vio—
lating police procedures and is taken
into custody by the LAPD alongside
Snipes. Both men are sentenced to a
“cym” prison. whcrc they are to serve
decades in a frozen capsule. While
serving their freezerrtjme in the cyro
prison, the men are supposed to be
reprogrammed to be good citizens.

But, something goes wrong, and
Snipes escapesin lheyear2032. Soci-
ety, which has become a place of
smoothering love and happiness, and
where everything that is bad for you
has been outlawed, is not equipped to
deal Willi a criminal ofhis caliber. At
this point, Stallone is defrosted to save
the day.

This movieisvery fastvpaced and
successfully covers a lot of ground.
Violence is excessive, but honoriﬁc
scenes are kept to a minimum. There
,are some holes in the plotas usual. but
for the most part. things hold together
quite well. Stallone'schamcter is shal-
low and underdeveloped. andwhilehe
does a ﬁne job portraying Stockton.
Stallone‘s performance is not note-
worthy. Snipes has the surprise per-
formance of the day: he does zl good
job of prouaying a deranged and ml-
ous criminal and his character is actu-
ally interesting and fun to watch. The
ending to Demolition Man is abrupt
andanticlimatie.butoveralllhc ﬁlm is
very cntcnaining and a good way to
get away from Grinncll and the
thoughtsol schoolwork forafewhours.

Take the relllablc cops and rob-
bers plot, add a cultural dimension,
and you’ll have the movieRlsi'rlg Slut.
The movie stars Wesley Snipes and

Sean Connery as Los Angelcs llClCCr
lives whoarc investigating the murder
of an American ill a lﬂpﬂﬂeSC'OWnCll
ofﬁce building. Both characters por-
trayod hy Snth and Connery are lynr.
ing and SupCfllClﬂl and viewers ﬁnd
themselves hard-pressed to actually

czlrczlbolltelther. Thecllttractcrplayt‘d '

by Snipes is stereotypical and trite;
Connery's is arrogant and annoying.
Unless you have read ”to novel
Rising Sun before going to see the
movie, he prepared to play calchrup
during the entire ﬁlln. The movie
moves so swiftly from one action-
paekcd scene to the next that viewers
are lcftconfllscd and clueless. Several
bothersomequestions remained unanr
swcred at the tnovte’s close. The
movie was touted as a ﬁlm that deals
with the “hard issues of relations be
tween the Japanese and Americans,"
but the ﬁlm seems more like another
confused murder detective ﬁlm than
anything else. The conclusion of the
ﬁlm is somewhat surprising. nonetheA
less anticlimatic and disappointing.
Confused, disorganized, and a
deﬁnite ﬂop arc the words to describe
the movie True Romance. The movie
is a wacky, off-the»wall Comic love
story betwwnaprostituteandalonely
college dropout. The ﬁlm moves
slowly in the beginning, but picks up
in themiddle as the plot improves. Mr.
lonely dropoulgocsto lhohousc oihis
girlfriends' pimp to retrieve her be
longings and ends up killing the guy.
In a msh to get away from the scene of
the crime, he takes off with what he
thinks are his girlfriends' clothes.
When the maﬁa starts following him.
he discovers the suitcase instead cone
wins millions of dollars wonh of co-
caine. Advised by the presence of
Elvis, lle anti his girl takeoff forCali-
fomia to sell the cocaine to a rich
Hollywood producer before the mafia
can catch up to them. The movie ends
with an unrealistic shootout in which
all lhepoliceand maﬁamcnarekillod,
and only the dropout and his girl rc-
ntain to make a quick and happily-
evcrraflcr getaway to Mexico.
Despite the ﬁlm’s problems in
plotand continuity, the movie is enter-
taining in a wacky sort of way.
