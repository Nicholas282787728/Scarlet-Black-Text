Communications Ends As Department

, Interdisciplinary Study Continues

by Don Dagenais

Accepting a recommendation from
the Executive Coundil and the face
ulty, the Grinnell College Board 01
Trustees unanimously voted last
weekend to disestablish the Depart-
ment of Communications effective
at the end of the 1973—74 academic
year.

The Trustees also approved iunding
at a “supportive academic pro
gram" for minority students begins
ning next summer, endoresed the es
tahllshment at a campus pub next
fall in the private dining rooms
beneath the Quad dining hall, and
passed a resolution accepting the
College’s “ethical responsibility"
in promoting the public interest
by voting selectivelyon proxy issues
of corporations in which the college
owns stock.

A report of the Trustees’ re-
solution concerning the college
pub appears elsewhere on this
page.

——.
Several procedural matters occupr

led the Board as well. Faculty pros
motions and a host of new appoint-
ments were approved, the budget
for the next school year was deter»
mined, and action onproposed chan»
ges in the by-laws was postponed
until the June meeting.

Communications

in a resolution Concerningthe Come
munications Department, the Board
emphasized that it recognizes the
importance orcommunications study
and ”wishes to continue this trad-
ition by making available to Grin-
nell students both general and spec-
iiic courses, programs, and inde—
pendent project work in communica-
tions skills."

Citing ﬁnancial considerations,
however, the Board accepted the
previous recommendations to abolr
ish the department itselt.

Studies in the communications
field, however, will “he continued
as an interdisciplinary program in
the curriculum oi the College."
Present plans are {or the college
to undertake an evaluation of possi»
ble curricula next year in the hopes
at establishing an interdisciplinary
program in communications for
years in the iuture. The Board is
to receive a full report on the
matter next year.

“Everybody agreed that we ought

to have a communications pro-
gram,” President Glenn Leggett
told the SltE following the meeting,
“but everybody also agreed that the
present situation is not good."
While the Trustees recognizedthat
”discontinuation is a symbolic ges-
ture lrbught with uniortunate impli—
cations,” he said, most members
felt that the current department
must be abolished in order (or
the college to begin anew to found
an adequate program in the iield.
The interdisciplinary study ofcom—
munications, according to the lace
ard’s resolution, will be staffed by
Protessor William Vanderpool, the
current tenured member at the de-
partment, and members at other
departments or the college ”wh-
ose expertise can contribute to the
understanding and development oi
communication as an integral part
ot...a liberal education.”
Minority program

Acting on a recommendation of the
college‘s MultivRacial Committee,
which is composed of several Trus—
tees and iaculty members, the 807
ard approved the iunding or a ”supr
portive academic program" tor
minority students at the college.
The program will begin next sum
mer as some minority students will
be brought to the campus for study,
and will “have a mechanism which
will continue throughout the year,”

according to President Leggett.

During the academic year students
will have the use oi special tutors
assigned to them.

The estimated cost oftneprogram,
according to Dean Waldo Walker,
is approximately $16,000 per year.
Grinneil has already received a gr.
ant of $4,500 per year ior three
years to help finance the project,
and remaining iunds will be supv
plied out at the college’s operating
budget.

Ethical Responsibility

Acting on a recommendation from
the Joint Board last week that
“Grinnell College has a moral re-
sponsibility to minimize the social
injury stemming irom its proiits,”
the Board recognized the college’s
ability to assert "its rights as a
shareholder to iniluence corporate

Between 600-800 scientists of all
disciplines are descending upon the
Grinnell campus ,Apri! 27 and 23
to attend the 85th annual session
of the lowa Academy of Science
which Grinneli is hosting this year.
During the upcoming scheduled see
ssions, Students and faculty irom all
over the state of Iowa will present
scientiiic papers, many or which
will be published later. To provide
space for these meetings, the Col»
lege has turned over the science
building and several rooms in ARH
and Goodnow for the Friday and
Saturday sessions.

The principle address will be gt»
ven by Dr Clarence E. Larson on
the “Energy Crisis” on Friday at
8 00 pm, in Roberts Theatrei His
background includes being the past
president oi‘ the Nuclear Division

A common springtime sight on Friday afternoons: students sitting on
e from terrace of the Forum, perusing the iatestissue oi the stint

at the Union Carbide Corporation
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee where he
organized the establishment at the
National Laboratory there.

In 1955, Dr. Larson was a dele-
gate to the “United Nations Canter-
ence on Peacetul Uses of Atomic
Energy.” Presently he is a mem-
ber of the Atomic Energy Commi»
ssion alter being appointed by pre-
sident Nixon in 1969.

Another guest lecturer, Professor
Claire C. Patterson from the In-
stitute oi Technology in Pasadena,
California, will speak on Friday at
11:00 am, in Roberts Theater. His
topic is “The Accidental Loss of
Silver in Ancient Times and Its
Inﬂuence on the Fall of the Roman
Empire.”

Two other special sessions are also
scheduled for Friday, both start
ing at 4:00 p.m. In the science
building in room 17], Leslie Trow-
bridge will present “Science Educ
cation Looks At Itself Through Na»
tional Assessment.” Currently he
is the chairman ot the department
ot Science Education at the Univer-
sity at Northern Colorado and is
also the president~elect of the Na-
tional Science Teachers Associ»
ation.

William Garner, the research and
monitoring representative to the
Environmental Agency in Kansas
City, will speak on “The Potential
of lnteriace Between EPA Techni-
cal Programs andtheUnlversities.”
The lecture will be held in the ARH
Auditorium.

The many scientiiic disciplines re-
presented are: Anthropology, Eo-
tany, Chemistry (Analytical, Biolog-
ical, Inorganic, Organic and Phy-
sical), Conservation, Economics,
Engineering, Geology, Mathematics,
Psysiology, Psychology, Science
Teaching and Zoology.

The Academy itself is the titth or

sixth largest of its kind in thecounr
try and one of the most active. They
meet yearly, rotating the place tor
the annual session among the acae
demlc institutions in the state. The
Academy also publishes a quarterly
iournal containing some of the sc-
ientific papers of its members in
all areas of science.

world" into the campus experience.
Goldberg would allow tor oiiecampus
work opportunities that might then
culminate in ”some sort oiacademic
product,” such as a paper or apre»
sentation, when the student returns
to the campus.

Goldberg also proposed more care,
iully drawn guidelines for indepenr
dent projects. with less leeway left
for the discretion of the dean’s
office in approving projects. There
Should be considerable input trom
students in wr ing the guidelines,
Goldberg said, and the criterion
for dividing instructors' indepene
dent/class workload should be stun
dent demand.

EPC needs to take the initiative
in communicating with and involve
ing students, particularly ireshmen,
he said.

Goldberg also advocated an ex~
pansiun oi the tutorial program
so it could be used to aid students
whose backgrounds in certain areas
might be weak,

Leonard Kurz urges a reorienta-
tion of the academic system to str-
ess the value of learning ior its
own sake rather than as a vehicle
for grades and credit,

He would like to see a desempha-
sis oi some of the traditional val-
ues in both grading and faculty
selection, he said.

“It's a mistake to continue ch—
oosing faculty members solely ac-
cording to the standards that'were
used years ago,” Kurz said. He
urged that non-academic creden-
tials, such as service in the state
Department, or other kinds olprac-
tical work, play a role in selec-
tion ol personnel.

Kurz also said that student repre—
sentatives should be willing to chal-
lenge and disagree with iaculty and
the administration--“to politically
oppose them”~when required by
student opinion, regardless ofper-
sonal leelings.

At the heart of Mark Willcher’s
campaign is a four-point program.
