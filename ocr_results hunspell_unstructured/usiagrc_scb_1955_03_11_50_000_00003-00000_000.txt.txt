‘St. Louis twill interview for
positions in retailing and mer-
ul'tandlsing on March 30.

General Electric

General Electric, llhe “big
one”, according to Thornton,
will have its representative here
on March 31. Emphasis will be
laid on the fields at advertising
and public relations, but students
interested in accounting and fin~
aucing will also be interviewed.

Thorton stressed the boot that
anyone interested in being in-
terviewed for jobs should do it
now, for there will be veiy tew
representatives here after vaca—
timl. He said that the “act time
oi the interviews would be an-
nounced on the Friday before
the date scheduled. All inter.
views are held in the ex-pl‘esir
dent’s office.

offers Advice
To help seniors in these in
terviews, Thornton made seVr
era! suggmtions. “interviewers
are most imprased by individ-
uals who appear alert and neatly
groomed, are alble to express

ﬁg‘ﬁ‘ﬁ.

themselves effectively, and who
can identify their major inter
ests and the tylpe of work they
desire, In other words, they
should have organized and es-
tablished their vocational goals,
rauier than still be groping
around,

“in addition, the jolbseeker
should show a willingness to
contribute to the representative's
company, He should indicate
how his qualifications, abilities,
and interests will allow him to
best scrve the interests of the
company, rather than put em-
phasis on how the company can
serve him.”

Sll itable Dress

He also said that the applicant
should not be verbally aggres.
slve, lbut should nevertheless
attempt to answer pertinent
questions with more than mono-
syllables. Suitable dress for both
men and women is a suit or its
equivalent, and the women
s’llould wear hose and heels if
possible.

Desired Qualities

In regard to male applicants.
Thornton stressed that “most in»
terviewers who Come to t‘he
campus are interested in people
with potential on a long-term
basis; consequently, for.most in—
terviews lihe poser ‘y of im-
minent military service is not of
too great Consequence. Men
should make use of this place-
ment service While it is avail-
able, rather than wait until
after they come out of the ser-
Vice. At that time the applicant
has the inconvenience and ex~
pense of visiting many oom-
panics, instead 0! having them

Breakfast Idea
For Sunday

Student council dropped
the idea of having Sunday
breakfasts served in the
lounges when a student poll
showed that the school was
not in favor of such it plan.
Polls were taken Monday in
some north campus housemeet-
lugs to determine the student
opinion. South campus was not
polled because of the mass
meeting held Monday night.

The student council decided to
drop the idea when Ken Kasse»
haum, president, suggested and
Dottie Fulton concurred that the
vote would probably go the
same way on south campus.

The same bus which Was made
available for trips to the Lake
Acre project is now also avail-
able for trips off campus to see
events in other cities, for pic—
nics, etc. Due to a clause in the
insurance policy the bus may
only travel within a 55 mile rae
dius of Grinnell, A nominal fee
will he charged. A chaperono
will be necessary for all trips.
Irv Simone (physical education)
is in charge of arrangements for
the bus. ‘

A motion was passed that the
student Council give a vote of
conﬁdence for the three new
faculty committees, namely the
committee on student organiza-
tions, on public events, and on
student publications.

Ken Kassebsum appointed
Dave Brown publicity chairman
for the Council. Bali Blistmm,
representative or South Younker,
was expelled tom the student
council. A new representative
will be chosen shortly by that
hall

visiting him.

“Anoﬁher value of the place.
ment interviews is that the stud-
ent can compare and evaluate
the different companies, as well
as broaden his understanding of
what is involved in a certain
industry or kind of business.”
