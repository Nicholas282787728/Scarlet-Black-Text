COOKING THEIR GOOSE

Perhaps the most artistic job of cooking
one’s own goose ever undertaken by a youth
organization was accomplished last week
when the stew that the American Youth
Congress had been mixing for the past
several months came to a quick boil. A
group of some 5,000 young people, according
to one of their placards, “The Voice of 21,-
000,000 youths," paraded around the capital
city, heard leaders defend the organization’s
ideals of social and political justice, and at
the some time gave unsympathetic speakers
the bum’ s rush

Highlighting the meeting was a speech de-
livered by President Roosevelt to the gather-
ing which assembled outside of the White
House. Speaking in the manner of a Dutch
uncle, the Chief Executive condemned the
recent action of the organization, when it
failed to approve of U. S. aid to Finland on
the ground that such action was an attempt
to force the country into an imperialistic
war as so much “unadulterated twaddle."

The next day, even Mrs. Roosevelt, who
has repeatedly defended the movement,
gently chided its members for going on re-
cord “for something you don‘t believe in."
Despite her sympathy for liberal youth
movements, she must have had a feeling
that this palticular group had violated her
t111st. She had believed in giving this group
a hearing so that they could discuss intelli-
gently the social, political, and economic
problems of youth in a democracy.

But the American Youth Congress has
overplayed its hand. Whether it be true
that the group is dominated by Communists
or not, the fact remains that its public pro—
nouncelnents are tinged too strongly with
the red, rather than the truly liberal, philo—
sophy. Moreover, it is now apparent that
despite the group’s contention that they are
fighting for the freedom from suppression
of all political minorities, they kick people
out of their meetings that do not agree with
them and either act disgustingly sullen or
boo the President when he tries to show
them the inconsistency of their position.

The worst sin of the Youth Congress is,
however, not against the principles of
liberalism and democracy, but against in-
telligence itself.

Composed to a large extent of the radical

“intelligentsia‘ among American students,
the group nevertheless evidenced a startling
lack of grey matter when it publicly flaunted
tolerance and democratic processes In so
doing it has lost the valuable support of all

true liberals

By support of one government, Russia,
when the overwhelming majority of
the American people now has evidence that
this nation hasn’t even a measure of demo—
cracy or liberalism, the Youth Congress has
made a tactical blunder of the worst type.

With proof of both hypocrisy in their
philosophy and downright dumbness in their
public actions, it is little wonder that obs
servers declare that as an important youth
movement and political force, the American
Youth Congress is washed up.

We believe that when a youth group asks
the people of Ame ca and the legislature for
aid, they must first show that they are
wortlly of it.

THE PRIZE COMPETITION .

At Grinnell, as at other colleges, public l'e—
cognition is accorded chieﬂy to those whose
talents require public performance. We are
acquainted with our musicians, our actors
and athletes because we have seen them on
the stage and the playing field. But there
are others of equal talent who may scarcely
be recognized outside the classroom, some—
times indeed not even there. Those who
write or paint, requiring no immediate audi-
ence, are nevertheless quite as needful and
deserving of encouragement Thele ale not
many oppoltllllities fol such recognition; so
the annual plize competitions in the writing
of poetry, essay, and drama, and in art, are
to be emphasized doubly.

Few colleges anywhere offer so valuable
an award for creative writing as the Selden
Whitcomb prize for poetry. Three judges,
one of whom is each year a nationally known
poet, select the winners of three prizes
totalling two hundred forty dollars. Yet the
number of competitors in the last few years
has been Very small. And instead of being
encouraged by the unusual combination of a
small field of competition and a large award,
even students of great talent have been too
quick to make the fatalistic assumption that
the winner is somehow foreordained. Never»
theless, dark-horse competitors have upset
predictions; and this year, with two of last
year’s prize winners no longer/at Grinnell,
offers another opportunity. 1

The Harry I. Worth prize for the best
personal library, while limited to seniors,
also deserves mention, and should be an en-
couragement to underclassmen as well. The
contests close April fifteenth; it is time to
be preparing for them now.

G
QUOTABLE QUOTES

(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“College men and women are peculiarly
the sentinels on the outer walls. There was
never more need for clear thinking and
courageous doing by college men and women
than there is today. We of the universities
must more aggressively, more earnestly,
more militantly combat these fallacies and
heresies and expound and ‘sell’ representa-
tive democracy. It is bastion of our liber-
ties, and the foundation of our faith must
not be undermined." Diplomat Joseph E.
Davies (Wisconsin ’98) urges .collegians to
fight the fallacies of today’s world.

a—

“If we cannot conduct our intercollegiate
programs without subsidizing our athletes or
proselyting prospective athletic candidates,
let us frankly admit that we have gone the
whole professional way and that henceforth
we shall pay our athletes for their services”
Harvard University’s athletic director, W.
J. Bingham, wants no half-way measures in
solving the play—for—pay problem. .

(F

“A person’s intellectual capabilities do not
decline after he is 40, if he uses those capa-
bilities. The average person may show a
little decrease in speed, perhaps, but in real
intellectual accomplishments no substantial
decline is indicated." University of Cali-
fornia’s Dean Frank H. Freeman can cite
many tests to prove his theory that keen—
ness of mind does not decline in the ”fright-
ening forties.”

 

'Ghos’rs' Scenery
Near CompIeiion;
RehearsaIs Dain

For the first time in many years,
the Grinnell rlrzuna department
will present a well-known classic
play. "Ghosts," a tragedy by
Henrik Ibsen, the father of mod»
ern drama, IS heing rehearsed
daily.

“Ghosts," one or Ibsen's most
difficult plays, is a prohlem play
of a woman trying to blot out the
sins of her husband for the sake
of her son. The time is the late
nineteenth century. Period cos-
tumes are now being fitted on the
characters, and furniture of the
nineteenth century is being bor-
rowed from Grinnell residents.

By the middle of next week,
Alfred Boylen, technician, and the
building and painting crew plan
to have all scenery finished.

tary of the Friend's service com-

Want to Clean Up
On The Market?

You may not be in Wall
Street, but cleaning up is
your business. During the
school year, Grinnell col-
lege students clean up to
the tune of $5,000, in
cleaning and pressing bills.
