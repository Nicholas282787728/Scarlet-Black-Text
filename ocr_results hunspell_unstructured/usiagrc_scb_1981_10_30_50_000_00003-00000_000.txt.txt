by Marilyn l. clark

tn dusty tunnels beneath buildings and in
seldumrused oiilce and dorm stormrooms,
many antiques and college memorabilia
were uncovered during iall break by a
committee consisting oi 23 people in
terested in locating and preservmg art
irom Grinnell's past

in the last iew years many iaculty
members have expressed interest in
preserving the college's known artiiacts.
On March 6, 1980, John Keefe, an art
historian and iormer curator oi European
decorative art at the Art Instltute of
Chicago, gave a Scholars Convocation en»
titled “French iniluehce on American
Decorative Art " while he was on campus
he brought to the college's attention the
iact that many oi the antique chairs and
iahles located in Grinnell House were oi

considerable value and that care should be
taken to prevent damage to these items.

In early October oi this year, Dave Mc-
Connell, director oi Food Service, called
interested people together to term a com.
mittee with two purposes The iirst was to
identity antiques and memorabilia the colr
lege has which are noton iiie in the Perma.
nent Art Collection. The second was to
determine what should be done with these
items.

The core committee, chaired by McCon.
nell, includes David Jordan. proiessor oi
history; Dick Cervene, proiessor oi art
and curator oi the Permanent Art Collec~
tion, Grant Gale, proiessor emeritus oi
physics and curator oi the Physics
Historical Museum; Anne Kintner, college
archivist; and Susan Drake, wile oi Presir

dent George Drake, The committee
selected Oct, 22 as the day to conduct the
inventory On this day 17 active and
retired iaculty members along with six
students dividedinto teams and conducted
a search oi all college buildings except the
oil-campus houses and private oiiices
These areas will be searciicd later aiter
the occupants have been contacted.

Many oi the items iound are oi historical
and artistic value "Some oi the more in»
teresting iinds oi the search " said McCon-
nell. "include oak tables originally irom
Carnegie Library, iound iii the Physical
Plant, clocks irom the 18005, an early zoth
century Spalding bicycle, what is thought
to be the old college bell irom Davenport,
an italian Renaissance table possibly irom
a castle in italy and originally donated by

the Rosenﬁeld iamily, clawei‘ooted Queen
Annestyle tables, and three prints by
Giovanni Battista Piranesi, an 18th cen~
tury etcher and architect."

in the early part oi November the com.
mittee will begin to evaluate the qualily oi
the items iound McConnell hopes to iind a
saie environment tor the preservation oi
this art 7 an area not designated ior
iuture renovation ”Some oi the art may
be placed in oiiices so that people can
become iamiliar with the college's collec.
tion," said McConnell. Cervene noted.
"Any original works oi art like the
Piranest prints will most likely be added to
the Permanent Art Collection, while the
art describing the history oi Grinnell will
probably be housed with the college's ar~
chival material

Gang Bang stirs conﬂict
Petition gets 530 signatures

by Eric Weiss

The title of one of Grinnell's all-campus
parties, the James Gang Bang, has stirred
up more controversy than the question oi
who is going to buy the beer, A iew weeks
ago, a group oi students led by Dave Cooke
and Joan Flynn sponsored a petition to
change the name or the event, which i:
scheduled ior Nov. M. The name. they
charged, is synonomous with gang rape,

In response to this petition drive, Jamm
Hall President Reg Archambault said that
ii the group garnered 550 signatures. he
would change the name. In three days, the
group collected 530 signatures, Archame
bauit later said this statement about the
petition was "premature" and dismissed
the petition as nothing more than a
“desperate rush for signatures."

Members oi the Women's Group also
assisted in the petition campaign. Accore

ding to Jane Brown, the group‘s COOP
dinator of political activities, several titles
were suggested by petition signers as
altemativﬁ to the name Gang Bang.
These included “Semesta ﬁesta" and
“James Games,"

Alter Archambault's second statement,
the matter Was taken to the SGA,
Members concluded that the petition was
not representative at the student body and
that it was up to James Hall to decide to
change the name, Archambault backed
SGA's decision and the matter was taken
to a vote at James Hall. An overwhelming
majority oi the residents voted to keep the
name. The theme is “Time Tunnel —
Come As Your Favorite Being of the Past
or Future."
