CAMPUS THOUGHT IN PRINT

Installation of equipment for night football,
enclosure of tllc Ward ﬁclcl press box, and partial
observance of the 11 o’clock hour on Armistice day
are three changes at Grillncll collegc this year
which were greatly influenced by The Scarlet and
Black editorially. To be provocative of administra-
tive and student action and thought, as termed by
Dean Shelton L, Beatty, has been the purpose of
the college newspaper. ~

Student and faculty thought has not always
coincided with that expressed in The Scarlet and
Black editorials To change individual viewpoints
on campus and international problems is not the
sole aim of the paper. Important problems concern-
ing Grinnell are laid before the readers, and cole
legs organizations under Whose supervision the var-
ious questions fall are privileged to take the Sug-
gestions as projects for their groups.

Some people object to The Scarlet and Black
editorially discussing certain campus activities on
the basis that the subjects should be left alone or
forgotten. Campus thought should be given on cam»
pus problems, and it is the duty of The Scarlet
and Block, as the ofﬁcial Grinnell college news-
paper, to print the thought editorially, Thci'papcr
is gradually coming to be recognized in that capacs
ity, as the dean of men said: “The college news-
paper is achieving a real placc in campus thought
among students and faculty."

Approving or disapproving, The Scarlet and
Black will continue to voice campus thought on
campus problems in an accurate, fair, and con-
vincing manner.

BOBBY JONES LEAVES GOLF

National as well as international interest in
the sport world was focused on Bobby Jones Tues
day morning, when the announcement was made
that he had withdrawn once and for all from ac-
tive competition in golf. Word of the action came
as a complctc surprise to cvcryone, for Such A step
by the Gcorgia lawyer had not been anticipated
even by close friends,

Through signing a contract with Warner
Brothers’ corporation to make a. series of vitaphonc
subjects on golf, Jones forfeits his standing as an
amateur, He is not interested in making money
from his favorite sport, however, but wishes to rcs
tain his game simply as a form of recreation, and
give more time to his profession, He is a lawyer,

Bobby’s action leaves the amateur ranks with
out a. real leader. George Von Elm, who was rc-
gordcd as second best, dropped out of the amateur
division some time ago to play for professional gain.
George Voigt of New York is considered by sport
experts to be the next probable successor to Jones.

Jones is retiring from golf at the age of 28. In
the 14 years that he has played the game, .he has
been an international sensation. He has, Won 18
British and American open and amateur champion-
ships. Lasi year has been thc'grcatest of. all years
for the golfer. Betting odds were held 50 to one
that he would not win all four of the great champ~
ionships, but Bobby, considered the greatest golfer
of all time, crushed through with the cup in the
British and American open and amateur matches.

As an ambassador of sporting good Will, Jones
is unequaled. Great British, chagrincd at losing
major championships to America, hailed the
Georgian’s success with fervor. The British press,
after Jones’ success, said that the American was, of
all competitors, most welcome to Great Britain’s

laurels.

Jollcs’ retirement not only will moon :1 new
champion crowned in the [our major divisions next
year, but will mean a big ﬁght for someone to will.
Doubtlcss the amateur rilulis will be increased next
ylcnr, sincc Jones and Von Elm will not be among
hem.

After the 12 rccls of pictures llovc been colu-
plctcrl, Bobby plans to return to Atlanta and forget
golf except as a form of recreation and exercise.
Just how well he will conform to his intentions,
only time can rcvcol.

DOERS SHOULD PAY

Occasionally .1 humor column uttcls some truth
dcrid cnough to make’tllosc at whom it is aimed
feel a really discomforting sting. Such seems to be
the case ill Wednesday’s issue of Tllc Scarlet and
Block, when Doric commcntcd that some young-
sters, too young to be playing with matches, set
ﬁre to the hay used at the Building Thrcc housc
party. ‘

A similar iucidclit has occurred in two sucr
ccssivc years. Last year tllc persons directly con-
cerned were required to reimburse the building
that suffered the expense. Tllis year the council of
house chairmen has generously agreed to repay the
loss from its own funds. Yet there is probably a
feeling ill the back of most minds that a better
purpose would be served if the culprits were found,
and made to pay personally for the cost whicll they
inflicted.

GRACEFULLY TAKING EXAMINATIONS

Always at tllis time of the college your there
is much feverish activity, many ldtc evenings of
desperate Study, and much self pity spent by the
youngr hopeful Phi 13ch Kappa members. However,
examinations there are and will contilluc to be.
and if the obstacle cannot be removed. the question
is: “How may one get over it gl'accfullv?"

Whether the material to be leorllctl in a course
is mastered (luring the weeks before examinations
or the night before the tests is ml important con»
sideration, of course. But which of the methods of
preparation you Select is based wholly upon pe
solml buses, such as convenience, ability to “cram,”
or a total inability to pour learning into your head
as water is poured into a gourd. However, given
the fact that you have complctcd the preparations
you are to make in the manner of your selection,
the actual problem of the examination is still
squarely before you and has not been hul-dled.

To make tllc hurdle gracefully and success
fully requires much. but there are two factors not
to be overlooked, for they will catch you under
each .iirlu at the moment you leave the ground to
pass the jump and odd immeasurable impetus to
your effort. Courage and calmness of mind arc the
benefactors. _

You’ve made the preparation, put what you
have clone down without fear and hedging about,
which will soon lead you into bewilderment. Keep
your mind calm and poised, for what ill on examine
zltiou is worse than panic Bc unafraid and calm as
you begin 'emaill fcdrlcss and poised throughout it,
and your piece of work will be coherent and vulu~

able.

PRESS DELEGATE TELLS EXPERIENCES
(From the 140M811 high schﬂnl IIIIII)

Thursday noon three Mill reporters, Mable Bauerly,
Blanche Knoop, and Donald Ladenhurger, left With Mr.
Swartley for Du Moines. From there the three be-
wildered Le Mars people took the train for Grinncll.
However, upon arriving they were cordially welcomed
and immediately felt at home. They have brought back
many new ideas and a great deal of enthusiasm: from
the lectures and roundtable discussions.

Friday night the press conventioners were entertained
at the night football game between Grinnell End Cornell,
with a. score of 12-3 in Grinnell's favor. The convention
was ended by a tea. dance given in honor of the dele-
gates Saturday afternoon. All returned feeling that the
weekend was well spent.

The most interesting lecture was given by Hurry
Brundldge of the SL Louis Star. Mr. Brundidge is the
“star" reporter or the above mentioned paper and his
experiences ranged from that o! a “fake doctor" to
that of o. "rum runner."

Mr. Brundidge is a most remarkable man. His high-
ly developed personality attracts people as ‘a. magnet
does steel. His mode of dress especially caught the eye.
A rather heavy woven tan suit was strikingly “topped
off” by a. brilliant green shirt. Such 8. combination
would detract from the average man, but it seemed to
add greatly to his appearance.

Mr, Brundidge stepped onto the speaker's platlorm
and began his speech by telling of the complimentary
statements made by Gary Cooper in regard to Grinnell
college. As you know Mr. Cooper was a student at
Grinnell.

Brundidge literally took. us Mu: him on his visit
to Al Capone's beautiful estate, be operated on us I915
a. fake physician, and We drunk 0. bottle of rum Mth
him on the rum runner ship. Next. we stood with him
before the Chicago grand jury and testiﬁed at the megnl
connections of reporters with gangsters. He closed his
speech of an hour and 15 minutes by thanking us for
our kind attention through his exciting End realistic
Wk.
