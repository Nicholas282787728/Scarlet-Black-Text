FINANCES SUBJECT AT “Y”

Association Takes Action to Liqui-
date Indebtedness.

The ﬁnancial position or the Y, M.
was the main subject oi George White's
talk at the Association meeting Thurs-
day night. He reported that 9. debt or
one hundred dollars was hold against
the Association, and that it was meas-
sary to pay it off as soon as possible.
This debt was incurred in painting and
repairing the interior of the rooms
during the Christmas holidays. The
money will he raised by subscription
within the next few days.

The work that the Y. M. C. A. does
in this college was also discussed by
the speaker. Besides the work or the
otiicers and of the Cabinet. whose div
ties are to see that the Y. .\i. is con-
ducted properly, there is a part for
every man it he is only willing to do
the work. Many things that are done
by the “Y” are not appreciated by
student}: who take advantage of tlleln.
The Men's Reception and General Re—
ception, which are held each fall, the
Men’s Stunt and various other things.
which are many times taken as a
incttor or course, are the work of
the Y. M. The rooms are open to any
one who cares to use them, and maga-
zines and newspapers can he had there
at nny time.

The ﬁreplace can be used on cold
evenings without charge—these and
many other things are used by the stil-
dents and the beneﬁciaries should be
willing to help pay tiic costs.
