Can the student media play a role?

Improve Lines of
Communication

Guest Editorial by Nate Lange

 

 

be a somewhat widely held feeling among students on campus:
a sense of nonaconnoctedncss with the real importantdecisions
that get made about Grinnell College.

Although there are many ways thatstudentinput is actively sought
by the administration and faculty, and in many cases it mayjust be that
students aren't using all of the channels open to them for expression of
opinions, I think that there are many things that could be done to
improve the lines of communication.

If President Ferguson wrote a biweekly ormonthly column for the
3&8, discussing the challenges and decisions currently being faccdby
the administration, I think it would make the student body feel
respected by the administrators of their college to an appreciably
greater degree.

There is no reason that administrative decisions, thought to be
controversial or not, should be made in secretand thenreleased, ready-
made, at the last minute. Even ifthe decisions being made are ones over
which the administration is solidly unwilling to allow studentconirol,
I think students would feel much better if they were informed of the
proews.

It might also help for the trustees to address the student body
directly, also through a written format, maybe a few times a year, after
big meetings. They wouldn't need to disclose any investment secrets
to make the impression that student concerns were considered in their
decision-making, as well.

Also, there may be ways to mend the apparentn'ft between student
concerns and the concerns of student govemmeni. How about, instead
of just putting minutes up in bathrooms, we have an actual meeting
every month to which attendance of the general student body is
actively encouraged, and at which issues of all kinds could be raised?
It could be kind of like a town meeting.

Dowe already have something like this thotmostpcoplejustdon't
know about? Our community isn‘t so large that direct democracy
would be impossible. Does this sound like a useful idea, or are things
actually ﬁne the way they are?

S EVERAL of the articles in last week’s 5&3 echo what seems to

Letters to
the Editor

To the Editor:

I’m writing in response to Tom
Zlabinger’s editorial “The Rise and
Fall ofGn'nncll.” [agree with alotof
what he says about the College’s ad
ministration being anal, etc. How»
ever. his comments about concerts
are close-minded, ignorant and mis-
leading.

This year it seems that everyone
is bitching about the concerts be»
cause their favorite bands have not
played at Grinnell. Yes, Jefferson
Airplane, Bruce Springsteen, the Via-
len! Femmer, and Soul Asylum have
all played here.

Nouetheless,theyallplayed here
before they were very wellrknown
nationally, by the mainstream. They
were all brought here by the concerts
committee as bands thatwere afford-
able and as bands that the committee
members thought were good and up
and-coming. They were not brought
here as mainstream top-40 acts. It
would be impossible to bring ‘the
3055’ back to Grinnell unless he
wanted to play for free.

Tom, like many people on this

campus, seems to be very narrowr
minded about the musrcians thatper»
form here. Bands like Head Candy
and Urge Overkill (who both played
here in the past two years) are in the
same position that Soul Asylum and
the Femtner were a few years ago
when they played here.

The Head Candy concert was
greatitoo bad only ten people stayed
for the whole thing. This is because
people wouldn't go because they had
never heard of them. Just watch, in
two years when Head Candy is a
well-known band across the country,
Grinncllians who didn’t even lake
the time to see them will boast about
how they once played here.

Thisis exactly whatgoes on now
when people mention Soul Asylum,
tthemmcr, and cvenA Tribe Called
Quest. For a college that is so “lib-
eral,”people shouldopcntheirminds
and cars a hell ofa lot more.

Also, Zlabinger’s sly comment
about Brand Nubian was unwar-
ranted. IfTom would look at the Rap
Charts for the last couple of months,
he would see lhathndNubian has
been in the top five for their new

album “In God We Trust." I’d guess
we would no longer be able to afford
them since they are one of the most
popular rap bands in the nation.

Who knows, maybe when they
become the next Public Enemy people
will stop bitching about concerts and
actually go to them. I’m not talking
aboutTom bccauseldon’tknow him
and don’t know whether he has been
to many concerts, but people who
don't show up to concerts have no
right to criticize them.

Contrary to popular belief, the
role ofthe concerts committee is not
to bring bands here that you can brag
about; it is to bring quality and varir
ety with our limited resources. There
is no reason that the concerts comr
mlttee should take abuse by people
who can't open their minds.

P.S. lfpeople wantall ofthe concerts
they whine about, ask the school to
give concerts about $100,000 a
semester.
