How Grinnell compares to other institutions on mental health, and how the administration approachs it

by Jeff Raderstrong

It could be one too many late-night
existential conversations in the Grill, or it
could be the 20rpage midrtel‘m due at the
end of the week But at some point in the
average Grinnell College students career,
they begin to realize that they are not in
a typical environment. The stress that this
college at times places on students, as well
as the mental health problems that ensue,
makes students wonder if there is something
different about this school.

Undoubtedly, Grinnell does have a high
rate ofmental health problems. Depression
and anxiety are much more prevalent at
Grinnell,wich 26.4 percent andzo.7 percent
orstudents suttering from depression and
anxiety respectively, compared to national
trends of18.4 percent and 13.4 percent,
respectively. These comparisons, from the
American College Health Association’s
spring 2007 National College Health
Assessment, compare with national trends
and not with our peer institutions which

could have higher prevalence rates than
the national levels, but they nonetheless
conﬁrm a tendency toward mental health
issues at Grinnell.

These problems could be a result or a
self-selection process that Grinnell creates
due to its mental health resources,“[lt seems
like] if you're choosing between Grinnell
and Carleton and Grinnell has walkain
counseling and you have depression, you’ll
Chose Grinnell," said joyce Stern '91, dean
for Student Academic Support and Advis-
ing. Grinnell also advertises a friendlier
and supportive atmosphere, which could
attract those looking for support for mental
health issues.

There are two different ways to approach
the pervasiveness of mental health issues on
campus. Some think that Grinnell attracts
people with inherent mental health issues,
while others think that the stress levels of
the Grinnell workload create these prob-
lems. “The questions are interesting,inher»
ently,” said Stern. “Butl shake myhead and
go: Who cares? We are where we are.l think
we need to ﬁnd creative ways to support our
students and create an environment that
doesn't allow those things [mental health
issues] to emerge,"

Because mental health is so individual-
istic, it is difﬁcult to determine it’Grinnell
creates the problems,or if people come with

them. “I think there are people who come
into school with problems and their prob-
lems are solved because there are at a place
like Grinnell,”said Emily Kugisaki'09,”and
there are also people who come in without
problems and then they have problems
because they're at a place Like Grinnell. 1
think it happens both ways."

The administration tries its best to help
students overcome these problems, offering
walloin counseling and eight free sessions
at the instown Poweshiek County Mental
Health Center, both ofwhich are not typical
practices of colleges. “You wouldn’t believe
the resources that go into worrying about
and trying to be proactive in supporting
students who we know have difﬁculties,"
said Stern.

The administration has also set up the
student advisor (SA) system, to broaden
the support network for students. During
their training before the start ofthe school
year, SAs attend an almost tourehour long
session on mental health issues, and are
trained with a mleeplaying exercise to help
them prepare to deal with students suffer-
ing from mental health problems. However,
“that doesn’t mean we’re ready for it," said

Kugisalti, who is an SA.

The size of the school also increases the
sense of community, maltin people more
aware of each other’s issues.“ At Grinnell],
you’re exposed to the same people, who can
and will recognize your problems," said
Patrick Lyons ’09.

However, this does not almys equate to
a more open dialogue about mental health
problems.“You can feel that the community
is there," said Kugisaki, “but that doesn’t
mean ou feel comfortable [opening up to
othersl."

Small groups of close friends, like
sports teams, also provide a strong network
of support. “We’re a very close team," said
Lyons, who is on the baseball team. "'ihere's
at least a few of us that pick up on [mental
health problems in others], which is all you
really need."

Even ifGr'rnnell has a high concentras
tion of mental health problems, there is
always a support network on campus, in one
form or another, for those who need it.“l’ve
always felt that there is someone watching
out for ,even if they’re not a friend,"said
Kugisakr “And that means a lot."

 

Peering into the nature of peer led groups

Sarah Smith ’08 and Fiona Martin '08 both worked in the maill'oom their
second years at Grinnell. They were talking one day about papers they
were writing for different classes and discovered that they were writing
on the same topiC7selfslnjury. They also discovered that they were both
cutters.

“Talking to each other made us realize that we are not alone," Srnrtli
said in a phone interview, Smith, who is currently studying on campus,
said that she and Martin know there were many more students on campus
who were in similar situationsrThcy decided that talking to each other was
so beneﬁcial and supportive that they decided to form Sight. “[Sight] is
a studentsrun support group for snidents who suffer or are dealing with
issues ofself—injury,” Smith said.

Both student’ and professionally led support groups exist on campus
to support students'lhey are generally the result of the organizational efs
forts ofindividual students or are formed based on a perceived need by the
administration/it times it has been unclear what role the college plays in
these peer-led groups, and whether the college is supportive of them.

“I am very willing to help and work [with a group], but I don't want to
intrude," Karen Cochran, director ofthe Health Center, said. “Ifsomeone
asked me to help out, I would do it.”

Deanna Shorb, dean of Religious Life and director of Community
Service, said the Chaplains omce provides space for several conﬁdential

 

support groups including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous
and a coming our group, as well as others.

In addition, the Clraplain‘s ofﬁce has administered a support group
concerning grietind loss (or moie than a decade. shoib said the oiiicc is
also looking into i new alcohol abuse group for students who arc unable
to diinlt responsibly.

Shorli said it is iinporrnnt for students to hire support tram a coin-
muuitv of their peers But while she may think student groups could be
helpful, tlrcr'c . ttlc the school can do to start thcm.“Wc can’t start these
[studenrelcd] groups,wc can only support them,"Shoib said.

Sight, one otthc most well known peer-led groups, is currently ins
active, but Smith said the group would be meeting again next semester.
Smith estimates that at least 90 percent ofgroup members are also seeking
professional lrelp,“'l'hcy go hand in liand,"she said.

Smith also said talking about those issues that people are told not to
mlk about provides students with a healthy outlet tor their emotions.

Although Sight is intended to he a group run by students, for students,
Smith believes there could be more communication with the Health Cent
tcr. “The school should take a more active role in what we are doing, not
necessarily who we iie doing it with,”she said.

smith said the school neither discourages nor facilitates her group and
suggested that the Health Center is a little nervous about the group.

Cochran said her only concern about such groups is that the snidcnts
