Gardner Cowlcs, editor oi

view of world airs. “I remain

Cowles stated that thc Hun-

that helped convince Asiathat
there will be no big war in the

In recent years, Coivlcs
noted, “Too much oi the rest
oi the world has looked on
America as a ncrvous, mili-
tnristic tgiant, somehow
strangely niraid oi Commun-
ism and hence dangerously
unprcdictable. We need to

Following the speeches, Cowies
hall president Neil Horton pres
scnted Cowles with an honorary
membership in Cowlcs hall and
a decorated paddle. Tile hall
was given to the college by the
'Cowlcs loundation, and is named
for Cowles' lather.

Bowen concluded with the re-

“We charge them, as per-

was able “to catch the chang—

which liespcaks a deep, an in
dcstriictihle, it natural moi-o1-

Society steadily progressed to-
wards the goals oi benevolence.
An eruption oi thought began
about 1913. By 1929, there was
“an upsurge oi pessimism, hed-
onism, egocentricity, and sever--
al torms oi socialism, all of

concluded.

Many painters and sculptors,

the most serious barriers to the
appreciation ot contemporary
art, charged Sweeney. They have
continued the notion that a

observed,

The attitude towards explora-

among Anicricaii painters otter
