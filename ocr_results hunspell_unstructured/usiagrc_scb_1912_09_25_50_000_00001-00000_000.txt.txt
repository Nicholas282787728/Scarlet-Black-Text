it is said by tlranintic critics that it
was the most successiul vehicle oi all

The absorbing dramatic action oi the
play has to do with the relationship
between an aristocratic English iamily
and a wealthy Jewish iamily who live
next door. The old Englishman has
a cholcric aversion tor the Jewish race

ships used to he disulssul br poets and
pursons, but now statesmen are called
upon to cope rritlr them. Tire racial
pioblcrrr has not us yet reached this
stage.

The spcaker traced the history oi the
negro in America. and aliiimed that
simply bemuse the hlaclt man has not
becrr able to attain in a lerv centric
ies the civiiinrtion which it has rahen
rrs years to acquire, we ioolt down upon
him. The problem oi the Chine , lap-
ancse. and ltaliau laborers is coming
to he just as vital as the negro proh-
lcm. The trouble is that thcrc are too
many purposeless Americans, llllil ior-
eign rvorhmeu have to he irirportcd to
do their work. This inct is bringing
our till young country into degellcrr
