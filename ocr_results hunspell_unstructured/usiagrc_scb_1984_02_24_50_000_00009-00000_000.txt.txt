_ The Year of
Livmg Dangerously

by Lil'Vl. Winters

Being the first Australian director to make an international reputation
for himself, Peter Weir (Gallipoli) now shows in his new film, “The Year
ot Living Dangerously" (1933), how it is possible to make a more
elaborate movie in the United States without losing either his distinct
style or his Australian flavor.

The setting is Indonesia in 1965 during the last monUis of President
Sakarno’s government. The story centers on the Caucasian community
of journalists and diplomats in Jakarta. Onto the scene arrives Guy
Hamilton (Mel Gibson), an inexperienced, ambitious Australian jourr
nalist who is determined to make a name for himself. However, Guy
needs help and guidance, and he finds it in the form of a half-Chinese, ‘
halt-Australian midge photographer, Bill Kwan (Linda Hunt), who
becomes his sidekick, tour guide, and matchmaker. The match is made
with Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver), the assistant military attache at
the British embassy who is privy to secret information which she passes
on to Guy.

This human drama in the miitt of political turmoil sometimes spreads
itself too thin by trying simultaneously to criticize decadent Western
journalists. express outrage at Sukamo's harsh regime, and present a
steamy Hollywood love story. However, the performances are
smashing, apecially that of Linda Hunt in a pivotal male role of Billy
Kwan. The tiny New York actress was chosen for the part because Weir
found her better for the role than any male. This romantic adventure will
be Shown Friday. Feb. 24 (tonight) at 9230 p.111. in ARH and Sunday, Feb.
26 at7100 pm. in ARH. 114 min.

0 Lucky Man!

Far from Indonesia and romance is Lindsay Anderson's mammoth
allegory “0 Lucky Man!" (1973). This British film with a definite sur-
realistic ﬂavor is sort of a streamlined, mod ”Pilgrim’s Progress"
saturated with biting satire.

Having shown Mick’s adolescnese in his earlier film “Il....," Anderson
now continues the saga of Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) in “0
Lucky Man! ” Now an adult, Mick is an eager coffee salesman who starts
a meteoric climb to the top. For a while, Mick has the whole World before
him. However, things begin to go awry. Finally the film comes full circle
when Mick, who is out of money, luck, and hope, answers a casting call
for the movie ”If...” conducted by Lindsay Anderson. When told to
smile, Mick demands. “What’s more to smile about?”

Anderson hits him with a script. Acceptance dawns, and Mick begins
to smile. He now understand what there is to smile about because he
knows the score.

Intercut with the storyline are the sardonic songs of Allan Price,
onetime leader of the Animals. whose lyrics function as a contemporary
Creek chorus to the journey of Mick. In addition to McDowell, the film
has a superb and versatile British cast with each member appearing in
at least two roles. With its complexities and occassional confusions, its
explosive energy, and its technical and stylistic virtuosity. mis lan-
tasy/fable which moves trom young-manon-therrise adventure to a
larger view of social corruption, can be seen Saturday. Feb, 25 at 11:15
prnl. in AK“ and Sunday, Feb. 26 at 9:00 p.m. in SL. 174 min.

Raiders of the Lost Ark

As part of the ongoing International Directors’ Series, Steven
Spielberg’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark” is a loving tribute to those thrill-a-
minute kiddie matinee favorites of the '305 and ’405. The film aims solely
to entertain and entertain it does. A virtual two-hour cinematic roller-
coaster ride, “Raiders” is the baby of the movie industry's two boy-
geniuses: Steven Spielberg who directs and George Lucas who produces.

The basic storyline is the search for ﬁle Art of the Covenant by both
Hitler, who wants to make his army invincible, and Indiana Jones (Har-
rison Ford), an archeology professor who plays daredevil in between
semesters. Recruited by the United States government in 1936, Indy
races to find the Ark before the Nazis do in order to save the free world
and democracy.

From the opening sequence which should serve as a rousing climax to
any other movie, the viewer has no time to catch his breath. In a tavern
in Nepal, Indy hooks up with an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen
Allen). Once reunited, they whisk off to Cairo where they encounter Inv
dy‘s arch-enemy and rival, Belloq (Paul Freeman), a sauve and amoral
French archeologist who‘is in cahoots with the Nazis and is also trying to
find the Ark, and are pursued by an asthmatic, Peter Lorre-like Nazi
sadist, Toht (Ronald Lacey).

Marion and Indy speed from continent to continent, catastmphe to
catastrophe, and time after time, they are seemingly inescapably trap-
ped only to escape for more adventures.

“Raiders" combines the cliffhanger elements and childlike innocence
of yesteryear with the means and sophistication oi today's technology. _
The scale is vast, but the skillful and stylistic craftsmanship and the
meticulous attention to detail are evident throughout. The adventurous
tone and the breakneck speed make this pure entertainment — you
know, the kind or edge-of—the-seat, popcorn entertainment you loved as a
kid. This film which admirably answers the lament of “They just don't
make'em like Huey used to!” Will show Monday, Feb. 27 at 9:30 lull. in
AK" and Tuesday, Feb. 2E at 9:30 pm. in ARH. 15 min.
