the speed of his dash and hurdle Der-
fol-mantles into play on the football

Bulldogs last season.

Louis but is in today's line-up
Critchelt
George Critehett, '24, Griunell, is a
groundrgainlllg ace. His toe work
has proved to be at great value to the

There is little zttlvnllce information

morning.
Although most ot the Flolleel' net

of the Drake team is practically un-
known hut it is expected that stiff
competition will he allordcd the urine

Mahara, Clark, Patrick, Hurt and
Harley will wield racquets fm‘ Drake,
while Nicolet, Brody, J.‘ stotts and
Plotts will compose the team repres~
outing Grinnell. The pairings will be
made this morning shortly before
play commences.

The Pioneer barriers tackle the
Drake distance runners this morning
in the second cross country run 01' the
season for Grillnell. “Doc" Hurts
protegcs are in good condition with
the possible exception of Jones who
has weal: arches from running on'

The Pioneers have the advantage
over Drake in that they have already
had one meet this season, and they
will strain cvcl'y citort to avenge last
Week's defeat by taking the Drake
team into camp. Coach Hull will de—
pend on Captain Meyer, Howard, and
