to learn.

As coach or the Grinneil team I
agree with him when he wrote it up as
a disgraceful exhibition of basket ball;
that Drake began the ”dirty work"
since they did not take it very kindly
in being behind; that Drake men Con-
tinuaily employed uniair tactics in the

with him when he stated that the

the ﬁrst, He specifically mentioned
the names of two Drake men who
fouled continually, but he did not
mention ally Grinnell men.

The Writer of the article blamed the

cluding coaches, athletic directors,
referee and players. He wanted to be
sure he picked the responsible part-
ies. '

In my opinion the official is the
man to blame. He is selected to run
the game according to set rules. He
has all the power in his hands and if
he is not capable he should be scratch-
ed from the list of officials.

The writer in question blamed the
official, stating that he was not com-

the Nebraska-Drake game Thursday
night and the game wasn't much
cleaner than ours. But no mention
was made of that in his paper. it all
depends on who Drake plays, it seems.

As to his suggestion that Drake and
Grinneii should abolish outside cun—
tests and confine themselves to in-
tramural athletics: will, maybe so,
but Grinnell does not seem to have
any trouble with her schedule in the
Missouri Valley.

Speaking for the Grinneii tea‘m, 1‘
absolve them from all blame for the
way the game was played. l have
engaged in athletics for the last fifteen
years and have been an advocate of
clean sportsmanship, but the ﬁrst iri-
stinct of nature is sell-defense. I am
working with the cleanest collection
of men here that I have ever had the
pleasure oi being with, and certainly
resent MT. Tayinr’s accusation of
Grinnell’s dirty Work.

SAYSSINEEHMUSTUQ !
MﬂHE THAN SING

Mme. Tillisch Declares Thai;
a Cow Can Make Noises and
Not Be Singer.

l

A sing’er must be much more than‘
a singer.

This assertion is made by Mme.
Borgijot Aurlrud Tilliscn, whose 'pro-
gram of Norwegian foil: music will be
a feature of her appearance in Grins,
nell next Friday under the auspices[
of the Gl'inneii College Lecture
liadamc Tillisoh believes
that every singer should be a thorough
student of literature. poetry, dramatic
art, painting and sculpture.

Sounds like a heavy diet, doesn't it?

Listen to the theories of this inter—

"n cowi can mlilre noises," Madame
Tillisch declares, “The singer should
be able to do much more than emit
tones, no matter how beautiful her
voice may hc. Every motion of her
body should contribute to the inter-
pretation of her songs. From sculpt:
tire and are she learns die significance
oi pose and color. Broad understand-
ing 0: literature and poetry permit
her'to sing intelligently. The im—
mobils singer may make a lovely
noise, but the dramatic artist sways
her hearers between smiles and tears."

Madame Tillisch, whose voice has
a range oi three full octaves, has
studied with the greatest masters of
this country and Europe. She has
spent many years in the perfection of
hen unusual programs of iolk music.

She establishes atmosphere by ap-
pouring in native costume. Her pict—
uresque garments are ,of homespun
wool, and were made by Norwegian
peasants. l-ler dress is of black, with
red, purple and green bindings. The
black 'wool apron is embroidered with
flowers and hound in gold and majen»
ta. Her black silk headdress is heav-
ily frinnged and embroidered in soft
colors. Over a white embroidered
blouse she wears an embroidered red
bodice. About her waist is wrapped
a hand woven belt, many yards in
length.‘ Silver ornaments are worn
about her neck.
