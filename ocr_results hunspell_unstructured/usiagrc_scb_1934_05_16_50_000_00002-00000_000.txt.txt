HATS OFF!

In this time of numerous student recitals. the
entire student body should take time off to render
a complete program of paeans ill honor of tllc sur-
prising Grinnell track team whicll has twice, ill tho,
last two weeks. completely upset predictions with
wholly unexpected performances.

Before the Drake dual lncct, Coach Lestcr
Duke admitted that he could figure no my to gain
a Grillncll victory vet the Pioneer runners rule
ministered to their rivals a decisive defeat; one
that was in no way a fluke. Preceding the state in
tel-collegiate meet Coach Duke asserted that the
best Grinllell could hope for, apparently, was third
place. Yet the Gril‘lncll team came through with
second place, being nosed out of the state chame
pionship in the last tlvo events of the meet.

It was not pessimism which prompted the
coach’s none too hopeful. predictions, for coaches
are not inclined to act ill that way; especially if
their teams are admittedly underdogs It was true
that the team which had represented Grillncll
throughout the indoor season and in the early meets
of the outdoor season was incapable of trouncing
Drake and placing so high among the other schools
of the state; bllt not so the present Squad.

Whether the rapid development has been due
to perfection of form accomplished by efficient
coaching, to increased stamina and coordination as
a result of individual training or to tllc illfllsiou of

. a new spirit in the members of the squad, it is dif
ficult to say. Undoubtedly all three have played a
part.

But regardless of why, the fact 'cmains that
the 1934 track representatives of Grinnell are cil-
joying success beyond all expectation, and deserve
wholehearted praise for their excellent record.

G
"THE THIRD HOUSE OF CONGRESS"

Pictures of 14 members of the “third house of
Congress,” familiarly known as the lobbyist group,
appeared ill last Sunday’s issue of. The Des Moines
Register.

The country as a whole is not well acquainted
with the tremendous influence that these unofficial
persons wicld. Nor does the country realize that
these same people are working in \Vashington to
achieve some purely selfish, sectional purpose. In
order to do this they bring great pressure to bear
upon the members of Congress with thc result that
the democratic Sp' it of Congress is destroyed and
it becomes a jealous, disunitcd body. no longcr i -
tclcstcd ill the welfare of the country as a whole.

It is true that each and every citizen of the
United States has the right to influellcc the formu-
lation of new laws, but this privilege has been sad-
ly abused during recent years. Tllc abuse has been
caused chieﬂy by the growth of lobbying.

The lobbyists do not represent the poop]
general; instead they arc rcprcscntllti cs of 5pc,
illtorests. The bankers, the lilauufacturcrs in fact
nearly every such group has its own lobby ._ The
result has bccll that more and more the govern-
ment has tended to be run to the satisfaction of the,
special interests who are financially alllc to hire
expert “buttonholel's ” )‘alhel' ~’lhtln in the interest
of. the pcople. It no wonder,
construe 'vc lcgislatim which might Stop on the
forlllor’s toes, either (ll r ill the ('Olnlllitloel'oolll or
finally appears ill Such an allcrctl form that it is
barely meogllizable.

Bill aftcr bill has thus been lnutilatcd or do
, slroycd ill the commitlccl-oom, and all at the i1 tie
gation of special interests which refused to yield
evcll tllc slightest portion of their unfair privileges.
It is true that one of the strongest lobbies ever or-
ganized rccclltly failed in an attempt to check the
stock market control bill; but even that lobby
failed only after the stiffcst kind of a fight, during;
which every conceivable kind of amendment was
suggested in an attempt to allow wild Speculation
to continue.

Fortunately this attempt failed, and the very
success of tile stock market control bill should

thcll, that am"

make people realize the possibility of controlling
this extra-legal body known “the third house
of Congress.” 11' the people. \llsh to have ally con-
trol at all over the government, or to he assured of
the future pass-lgc of constructive legislation, thll
lobby t must first be controlled. While tllc work of

MR. JOHNSON COLLEGTS THE WAR DEBTS

Congress recently passed a law known as
the, Johnson Act, forbidding individual Alncri-i
us to llmkc loans to foreign governlllculs that
‘c in default on tllL‘Il' debts to the United States.
ol'tlillg to the interpretation of this law by AL
torllcy Ucncrul Cummings, token payments tcn-
(lei-ed ill tllc plist by Great Britain, Italy, C CUIIOV
Latvia, and Litllllllnia exclude these nil-
tlons flolll being clussifcd as (lcfrlultcl-s, and they
may receive new loans. Soviet Russia is ill del'uult
:luso, it has not made payment on the old Kcrcn-
tlcbl. All other European llations, with the
eptiml of Finland, that. have borrowed money
from the United Stiltcs are considered in default
and (cannot be extended further credit by Ameri
can individuals.

Mr. Cummings’ ruling that tokcn paymcnts
made in the past exempt the countries concerned
from the operation of the law does not extend to
full .0 paylilcllls of the same character. Legal ad-
visers of the State Dc urtmcnt have already line
nounccd that ill tlleil interpretations of Mr. Cunn-
lnings’ ruling, future tokcn payments lncan lllltoe
lll‘rlllt: default.

Yet the European nations have no intention of
making any more full payments on their install-
ments as they conic due, For the past 14 years
thc United States has madc it as difficult as pos-
sible for its debtors to pay their bills. By its tariff
it has done its best to keep European goods out
of the count although as every economist knows.
“large inter latiolull debts can be transported over
a long period of time only when the debtor coune
try sends to thc crcditor a much larger volume of
goods than it receives ill return.”

Russia's debt to the United States is one of our
smaller outstanding obligations. The IBolshcviSt
party stated whcll 'lllc loan was made to the Kcr-
cllsl y g rnlllcllt that it would ‘ pudiatc the ob-
ligation if it came into power, as it soon (lid. Yet
the Johnson act strikes directly at Soviet Russia,
because ill the Sovlet Union practically all pur-
chases havc been made by the government to which
AlllPl‘it‘Z‘lll firms can no longer extend credit.

Tile Johnson act is not all intelligent endeavor
to promote the collection of war debts. It will pra
tically cut off American export trade with Ru.
sin, and will necessarily be a setback to the United
States' promising export tradc with the rest of
Europe. It cannot be regarded as anything more
than a flltilc gesture of international ill will.

CHARMS To SOOTHE STUDENT BREAST
(Dally Trojan)

In these hectic days of the semester's home-stretch,
relaxation is a more important item in a student's life
than at any other time of year. There is something pa-
thetically ironic in the fact that most students fail sig-
nally to take advantage of the best form of relaxation
when it is offered. .

The reference is to the numerous musical programs
that are available almost every day of the week in one
place or another on the campus.

The charms of music are real. One need not hear
such mighty masterpieces as the symphonies of Beetho-
ven to gain genuine spiritual reenforcement that results
in a calmer, saber, happier outlook on the problems clos<
est to daily existence. The chords of the organ have
power to thrill, but they also have power to soothe.

Let us serve a. double purpose by manifesting great-
er interest in the musical endeavors on the campus: not
only can we gain. as individuals. a personal benefit, but
we can eneourage the efforts of those who uhselfishly
bring us that benefit.

LET THE USER PAY
(Dolly Trojan)

While Congress is planning to turn the airmail back
to private eompanies again it might be well for it to
consider some new basis for the private operation of the
same.

The one question that has not been asked in all this
controversy. except perhaps by Will Rogers, is this: Why
have an airmail at all?

If one were to examine the mail sacks, said Rogers.
he probably would find post cards and letters telling
about Aunt Mllmie's pain in the back or the Weather in
Kansas. This is not Strictly so. he'eause the mail is used
to a great extent by banking houses, clearing house as
sociations, and persons in need of fast communication,

Brit if these firms heed fast service. should they not
be willing to pay for it? if the government were to
contract with the private companies to carry the mail
for whatever it chose and charge the user, not the post-
offiee department, the whole airmail could be p'iit on a
more businesslike basis Will that make the public use
the airmail less? Possibly. but those who need the ser-
vice should be willing to pay for it.

For eight cents, to carry a little letter over snow
covered mountains at night, the pilots risk their lives
and planes. Eight ocnts is all you pay; the government
pays the rest If a rate of 25 or 50 cents were charged
the firms that need fast service would still send their
letters by plane, but the government would he saved mil-
lions of dollars a year, and the pilots, if they crashed,
would die knowing that they sacrificed their lives for a
niueh more valuable cargo than formerly.

The solution of the airmail problem is not less sub-
sidy, but no subsidy at all, Let the public, who uses the
service, pay for the privilege, but don’t; let all the people
pay for a necessity or luxury that few of them use.
