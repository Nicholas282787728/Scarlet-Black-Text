sity is an issue; even as friendly as
people are, its hard to feel comfort»
able on this campus. especially when
other students comment about mi-
norities, I‘ve overheard people talk
about minorities on campus and
claim [the minority students] are
militant or want too much. I feel put
into a category. I need some space
away from that."

ISO social coordinator Mehr Latif
also indicated a need for room. “We
have one of the largest organizations
on campus. It‘s hard to ﬁnd an open
spot on campus for over 150 mem»
bers to discuss anything; we need a
place to effectively be able to get to-
gether."

From his ofﬁce, a bright room
twice the size of a triple in Younker,
Director of Admissions Vince Cuseo
talked about the issue.

“I think a multicultural center has
practical and symbolic importance,"
said Cuseo, who believes “there is a
need to show our commitment to stu-
dents of all backgrounds; to have
space for student organizations, es»
pecially multicultural organizations,"

When asked what he thought a
multicultural center could mean for
prospective students, Cuseo said “I
think it could enhance the experience
of prospective students...Iowa, by the
last census, had a minority popula
tion of 4%," Grinnell is made up of

13% domestic students of color and
3% international students.

“We‘re not on either of the coasts;
drawing students interested in diver-
sity is an imponant job for the Of-
ﬁce of Admissions, but there is only
so much an office can do," said
Cuseo. ”A lot of it comes from the
feeling prospective students get
when they visit or talk to students and
staff in their home town. I feel such
a multicultural center would show

NEWS & FEATURES

Space

our commitment to the diversity this
school should have. We’re not only
losing potential students ofcolor but
students looking for an ethnically
diverse community, regardless of
their heritage, as well."

With the project off the ground,
the next step for the Space Commitr
tee will be to bring in a consultant
from the college's architectural firm
to look at the campus and to assess
the possibilities, From there, an of-
ﬁcial blue printwill have to be made.

“At that point, students will have
a lot ofinput," said Childress. “Bib
sically. students will sit down With
the architect and say “Here is what
we want.’ In fact, a list has already
been started. We just have to figure
out how we can make that a reality."
The blueprints, once completed, and
budget will have to be approved by
the Trustee Building and Finance
Committee If they gain approval,
they will then be taken before the
entire Board of Trustees.

Even if everything works out, it
will still be some time before any
thing is built. “It's a very long pron
cess," said Childress. “One factor is
the timing of the trustee meetings,
which come three times a year. There
will have to be trustee approval for
each step before we can proceed."

But the Space Committee has
wasted no time. They hope to have
a consultant on campus within the
next month or so.

”This is not an issue that is going
to go away,” said Childress. “It some»
thing that is really needed on camr
pus and has widespread support.
And that if we’re going to be a camr
pus committed to multiculturalism,
and if we’re going to try to increase
the multicultural curriculum, we
have to prove that With a building.
We have to show a tangible commit~
merit."

EXCO

Now in its second year, the Experimental

cont. from page 1

that Grinnell cannot.

"The EXCO program can offer
students a means of taking a course
that the college may not be capable
of offering," said Sandlcr. “For in-
stance there are a lot of students on
campus that are very interested in
photography, but the school doesn‘t
have the resources to offer a pholog-
raphy class, EXCO can offer a class
because there are a number students
who know enough about pholograr
phy to offer a beginning Course. 1r
EXCO offered credit, students‘ ct?
forts in these classes would be legilir
mized.

The EXCO program at Grinnell
is modeled after a similar program
at Oberlin which has existed for 30
years. But while the college has been
very supportive, Sandler feels ll will
take time to turn EXCO at Grinnell
from an idea into an as well accepted
program as that offered by Oberlin.

“ At Oberlin the program is a septtr
rate part of the college, totally slur
dent run," she said “The credit sys
tem there is really important for the
teachers , because it offers them an
incentive to teach an EXCO class.
With incentive, more teacher 5 are
likely to participate, and that means
a Wider variety of courses.”

In place oftraditional professors,
the EXCO program allows current
Grinnell students as well as people
from the town of Grinnell to teach a
course about subjects they are paSr
sionate about. While the courses run
without 3 Syllabus, the ”professors"
are required give the EXCO Comll‘lllr
tee an application for describing wllat
their coursewill entail.

Despite the inevitable departure

College is pushing for accreditation

from traditional professors, to coir
legc students with a passton for the
Beatles. the results have been posi-
tive, Flt'slryenr Annalisa Haltberg,
who is enrolled in the Beatles EXCO
class. IS pleased with the program's
tertchcis.

“The guys who are teaching my
course littvc really taken on the role
ol’ teachers well, they‘ve been re-
ally responsible about sending out
cmalls,’ he said, “The courses give
students a lot ofopportunities to take
different subjects."

Onc ofthe blggestbenefits ofthe
Experimental College. Sandlcr feels,
is the small class size. which is more
cohesive to conversation and sharr
ing knowledge.

“ We' ve tried to keep the class size
down, and that makes conversation
more possible,” said Sandler. “Since
the classes don’t really have a prof,
they are more egalitarian , and for
more sharing or knowledge."

During the summer,EXCO began
to diverstly its program further by enr
couraglng more people from the
town or Grinnell to participate in
EXCO classes.

“One of the real problems in di-
verstly at Grinnell is age diversity,
so this summer I recruited townsr
people to be involved in the EXCO
program.” said Sandler. “Its a good
idea to learn from people who are
actively doing what they are teach
ing about. It helps break down the
myth that people can either do some—
thing practical or teach. EXCO can
be a great opportunity for the shar-
ing of practical knowledge."

Teacher applications for next
semester's EXCO classes will be
available around fall break, Every-
one is encouraged to apply.

not a part ofthe academic program."

One reason for this exclusion is
that Grinnell has no Journalism or
communications major These cred-
its would not fit conveniently inlO
Grinnell‘s curriculum. “The college
seems pretty resistant to givtng out
academic credit forthings in the gray
area," said Ben Coakley ‘99 stutioll
manager for KDIC.

“Students are paid for their work,"
he said, “so getting credit seems sec-
ondary to me."

Ben Nussbaum ‘98, a member of
SPARC, agreed. “We have thought
about creating Zl student initiative
recommending credits forthose who
participate in media. However, the
general feeling among the commit-
tee members was that.,,students
would prefer to be paid,"

Nussbaum also believes there
would be “too much hassle in terms
of how to set [a program] up.”

“The question is who would give

grades, be In ch' gc, clc explained
Nussbltum “The current system in
which students get credit for doing
internships is n possiblc model. I-Iowr
evet, it is worth noting that in this
model. faculty are involved as II'lIEIrlr
Slllp ridvisors, and grades are glVen.
We might not want faculty to have
any power in student media,"

”As well, ll seems like students
might hiivc a problem with overload
schediilcs (more titan 18 credit
hours) if publication work became
course work, and this could be prob-
lematic." said Don Elmore ’98 and
Erin Brallde1‘00,editors ofthe Free-
hand Press.

“It has been good to have some
cxpcrietice workingdircctly With the
publication process here, which is
irrcgardless (if the work being on a
transcript." sttid Elmore and Brandel.
“Getting a grade for this work might
even take some oftlic tun away from
working with the publications and
add some unnecessary pressure."

 

Bikes

continued from page 1

said, “I wouldn't be zit all surprised
if [my bike’s theft] was drugrrelated.
I don‘t think this was an innocent
case of bike»borrowing,". Northway
said she suspected that her bicycle
had been taken by a person or per-
sons driving a truck and taking many
bikes at once. This conjecture was
supported by the Scarlet & Black‘s
anonymous informant, who “tells
tioned that he had heard rumors that
thieves were driving around looking
for and stealing bikes in pickup

A recent rash of bicycle thefts
may be linked to drug use

trucks.

Whatever the nature of the prob
lcin, victims and authorities want to
focus on lllldlng a solution. ”Grlnr
nell is a beautiful, hikerfriendly en
vironment, Illntetosee peopleridmg
clunkers, or not riding bikes at all,
because they're afraid of having
things stolen," said Cooper. “1 think
the solution lies in owners being
more prudent about locking their
bikes, and the police cracking down
on bike thieves when they catch
them.” ‘
