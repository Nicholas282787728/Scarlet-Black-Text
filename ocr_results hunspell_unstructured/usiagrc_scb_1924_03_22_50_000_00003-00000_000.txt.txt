. ding 105,000 needy students in
nineteen different European countries
is the colossal undertaking of the
Student Friendship iuud organization.
Beginning its first real work in July
1920, the fund in its three years of
existence has raised' and spent over a
million and a halt dollars, a sum to
which thirtyrsix countries besides the
United States have contributed out of
sympathy for a deserving couse. In
these three years 22,234,545 meals,
426,567 articles or clothing, 70,315 text
books, and 43» tons oi coal have heen
furnished to assist the thousands of
European students who would other
wise have been compelled to cut their
university careers short for want of
the simplest necessities. Besides
feeding, clothing, and furnishing
books, the fund makes part of its pros
gram the payment or tuluon, the pro—
vision of shelter, and the rendering of
medical attention.

The European student Reliei is try-
ing to reorganize housing conditions

among the students, many of whom ‘

are sleeping from ten to fifty in a
single room. It is also operating stu—
dent kitchens; insuring needy Rus-
sians of at least one meal a day. There
are more than 31,000 students who are
living on that minimum amount of
food. daily.

wearable, among the students of the
American colleges and universities
Lack of sulticient clothing is one or
the majm‘ reasons why the Central
Europeans are Unable to attend the
schools. The following hit or conver—
sation is said to be typical: ”The
prohlem is solved, Michael! You have
shoes and I have a pair of trousers.
Now liud someone who has an over—
coat and the three 01 us can go to
classes, each two days a week,” This
houysnt sense at humor explains why
there are still 500,000 students in the
universities of Europe and Russia, in
lspite of all that those countries have
gone through—and are still going
through. But it does not explain all.
Had it not been for the practical help
oitercd hy the student Friendship
Fund, the ”orercoats" would propahly
never have been.

Griimell’s Yuri;
Remember that this week and next
week are the two weeks which
throughout the United States, schools
are calendared by the Student Friendr
ship Fund for the reception of mnsy
girts and the collection or old or par—
tially used clothing. Here at Grin-
nell, the drive is largely sponsored by
’the student Volunteers. All those
that have not already done so, should
-hend their donations or money to any

I

any of the house—chairmen, since tho

chairmen have charge of the

dorms, All clothing should be placed
in the Val’iuus buildings for that pur-
pose. Bear in mind that the 013*
Dol'tuuily to help will be over a week
from today, and sort out the clothes
you can do without. The clothes you
can do withouta European student
can do with!
