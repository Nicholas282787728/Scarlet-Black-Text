The SGA Joint Board consists of 23 senators who are elected by their

of these differences is that the issues discussed by senators are heard by the
SGA cabinet. This is imponant in that it is the duty of the SGA cabinet to
represent the concerns of the student body to the administration. “What do
you mean?“ I hear you ask. I mean that if the senators agree that we need
soap dispensers in the residence hall bathrooms, then the SGA cabinet must
ensure that the college administration hears and understands this concern.
Additionally, each week the Joint Board minutes are read by President
Ferguson, Dean Crady and the rest of Student Affairs, This means that if

Everybody Square Dance Now

By BRIAN JONES

The American Legion Post 577, in
Grimes, Iowa: a small building with
wooden floors and curved walls and
ceiling vaguely reminiscent of a
barn On the second Saturday of
every month, the Talking Fiddle-
heads are seated at one end of the
hall, chairs are lined up along the
walls, and the squares form in the
center.

Its a regular event in Grimes, this
monthly square dance, and it attracts
both guest callers from Chicago and
dancers from Grinnell, Last Satur-
day being the second Saturday ofthe
month, five Grinnell students made
the Just-OVCT-ﬂnrhoul’ drive to
Grimes (which is north of Des
Moines) to dance squares, contras, a
few circles and a waltz called by Bill
Sutcliff ofChicago.

The dancers were mostly older, the
majority being middle aged, and
Alice, Dorothy, Sarah, Jeremy and I
were easily the youngest outside of
the few children dancers had brought
along. Age, however. was probably
the worst indication‘ofenel’g)’; it was
with the middleraged ladies that I
was swung the most times in the few-
est measures (and I do mean “was
swung"7that stuff about the gent
leading doesn’t always mean a
thing).

Square dances are partner dances,
but that doesn’t mean that the only
person that you‘re swinging, doe-ce-
doe-ing or gypsying is your partner.
In most squares, while you may
swing your partner every time
through the dance, its a sure bet that
you'll be dancing with every meme
her of the opposite gender in the
square. And hey, this is the 90’s, and
gender in the square is determined
primarily by who is one the right of
whom (a quick lesson: the lady is
almost always to the right of the
gent),

One of the most popular dances of
the night, in fact, was called Cheat

Burling Counts in More
Ways than One

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

Few would be surprised to discover
that Burling Library staff counts
each time somebody enters the door.
Few would be surprised to discover
that students check out books at
Burling. However, some would
deﬁnitely be shocked to learn that
Burling counts each time a student
checks out a book. And everyone,
except Burling staff, ought to be
knocked senseless by the fact that
three times a day staff and students
staffrun around the library and count
everyone. Why are we being
counted? What evil plans does the
system have for us?

According to Gretchen Revie, pub-
lic services librarian at Burling, the
library counts an item‘s circulation
and uses that information when the
issue of that item‘s replacement
arises. Such information is particus
larly useful when the replacement
cost of a unit is particularly expen-
sive. Also the information is used
to determine if a second copy is
needed. However, since students can
acquire most books for a semester.
and faculty can acquire books for an
entire year, staffadmits that the user
fulness ofa book can not be entirely
measured by a raw Circulation count.
For instance, the Innopac database
shows that Madame Bovary by
Gustave Flaubert (1988 edition) had
been checked out three times be-
tween 1988 and November 13. 1995,
While this may not seem like much,
it is possible that particular version
of Madame Bavary has endured
three years of constant use by some
professor preparing for class.

The librarians can use the circular
tion counts in order to get a general
idea of usage patterns. For instance,
Innopec shows that in 1995 there
were 5,595 student check-outs in
September versus 8,270 check-outs
in November. For faculty, there were
1065 checkrouts in September and

980 in November. It is interesting to
see student checkrouts climb by
nearly 50% as CrunCl’lrilme ape
proaches, as faculty checkrouts stay
lcvcl.

Thanks to Innopac, stressed seniors,
Juniors and sophomores now havc
justification to g‘rowl at ﬁrstrycars,
innopac reports that between August
and May of last year the class of9é‘
were responsible for 22% of all
checkouts Juniors and sophomores
were responsible for 21.9% and
17 8% of check-outs respectively.
The class of ‘99 checked out only
11%. And this year the situation
promises to be the same. While the
class of ‘97 has checked out 26 8%
the class of ‘00 has only carried 9.7%
ofthe load, Thus, the library count-
ing systems are useful for scape-
goating ﬁrslrycms, perhaps its finest
feature.

Interestingly, library staffalso keeps
track of what is called ln-house use.
In-house entails hooks and periodi-
cals which are found to be out of
place. For instance, books found lay»
ing by the copiers are returned to the
circulation desk by workers and are

then scanned into the computers.
where the inrhouse statistic is then
incremented. Last year, there were
roughly 67,000 regular checkouts
and 22,000 in—house checkouts.

Burling users must pass a gate upon
entrance. Each time the gate is
moved an electronic counter incre-
ments a total count. However, stu—
dents often evade the gate, go
through the gate the wrong way or
hold the gate open for multiple oth
ers, rendering the attempt to count
the number of people who use
Burling futile, Therefore, three or
four times a day (at 10:30 am, 3:30
pm, 9:00 pm and 11.30 pm) faculty
and staff must rush through the

,building and count people. Thcmost

irarrtc by far IS seen at 9 co p.m. with
an average of about 100 students in»
habiting Burling. And at 10 30 in
the morning expect to see only about
30 ofyour red—eyed peers. Aekncwt
edged |S the fact that this system has
a few flaws, just as the gate Yet
between the gate and manual count-
ing it is hoped that a general idea of
Burling usage patterns can be deter-
mined

or Swing, “Cheat or swing" is a call
found inanumberofdifferent dances
which instructs the active person to
swtng either their partner (swing) or
someone else iii the square (client),
In Chm! or Swing, this call is used
to its fullest potential. As the caller
hinted when teaching the dance,
“swtng"is mcrelyafonnality;you’re
supposed to cheat. Even I, who was
sitting out the dance trying to catch
my breath from the last one, found
myself both swinging and being
swung.

Square dancing in Grimes began in
1987 or 88, according to Susan
Brown, a regular dancer, caller and

that, and that‘s why they just kept
