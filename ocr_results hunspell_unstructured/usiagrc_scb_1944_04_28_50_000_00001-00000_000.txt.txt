Honor Sy

Accep'l Penallies
Ouilined,.in To’ro

At an unusually live mass
meeting Tuesday night a
good three-fourths majority
voted to accept the consti-
tution of the honor system
as promulgated by the cen-
tral committee of the [stud-
ent council.

Cleveland cottage alone oppos-
ed thc plan when it was recom-
mended for voting at liousc meets
iiigs Monday night, A Cleicland
faction continued to vote nega-
tively at the student mass meets
iiig, but the motions to accept the
penalties as sct down by the cen-
tral committee and the Consume
tion in toto were easily on ~ied,
oltcr discussion on both sides.

The plan is still relatively tent-
ntive as it has not been finally
approved by the facility. The
student organizations committee
will consider it tomoirow, if ac-
ccpterl it will be ready for actual
practice in time for spring finals

‘ this year.

Limited Scope

As propsed now, the honor sys-
tem will apply only to announced
examinations. No student or fac-
ulty proctors will be in the ex
nmination rooin except for 10
minutes at the beginning and end
of the test. Geneial conduct
rules remain the salnewbouks, pa»

rpers, notes, etc, at the front of
'the room; students seated in al-
ternate scats. However it will be
permissible for students to leave
'the room any time during the ex-
am providing all discussion con-
lcerning the test is avoided and
booklets and test questions are
‘left in the room.
l Hedge

A pledge stating, “I have lleilhs
er given nor received aid in this
examination," will he signed by
all students on completion of the
examination. ,

violation ol the pledge is viola
tion of the honor system and
must be reported, either by the
individual who gave or received
aid, or by someone who saw him
to the student council. out
warning may be given before it
becomes necessary to report the
act, A unanimous decision of the
central committee of the council
is necessary for conviction.

Section VII of the constitution
deals with the penalties to be iii-
nictcd. “The penalty for a firsl
offense when the offender has re»
ported himsclf shall he’ an NC
in the course in which the viola-
tion occurred.

“The penalty for a first offense
when the offense has been report-
ported by an observer shall be

i no in tho course in which the

olatiun occurred and a two
ii-ccks' suspension from Grinnell
college.

“The penalty for a second of-
fensr, whether reported by’ the
offender or by an observer. shall
lie peiinancnt separation from ilic
collage.”
