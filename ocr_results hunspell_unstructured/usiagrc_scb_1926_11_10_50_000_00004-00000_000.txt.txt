and Since both teams linve powerful
olicnsivcs, it would not be surprising
to see c score something like 21 to 17
ipick your own horse.

Should Grinncll will, the Pioneers
will still have to trump on the Drake
Bulldogs, which in itself is no small
assignment since Ossie Solcm is not
in the habit or having tea. party tip~
plcrs on his ioothnll teams, and
Drake's 1925 record, while not im-
nrcssivc [mm the standpoint oi games
won, shows that the Bulldogs are a
poweriul eleven cnpnhlc of causing
any Valley tcnm nu litter-noon or vioc
lcnt exercise.

Doric Is Cuiiiplicntcd

The Oklahoma Aggics ‘tlm nro not
through nlicr tlic Grinnell game is
oi-cr, for on Tlinnksgiiing they tncklc
Oklahoma university in nn nniiunl
griidsc gninc.

And while that suhjcct is in mind,
don't think ‘that Oklahoma nor the
Cornhuskcrs nrc (int y out oi it. im-

both or those tenm, u-in thcir l'c—
lndiuiug simcs, which is not likely,
ihcy will have ore wins out of six
starts nnd will lend nil other tciims in
the pcrcciitngc column it the three
leaders meet defeat, Nchrnsko sincc
llei' defeat by Missouri at the start oi
the scnsoii, has been lying low, \\'ln—
lling the rcmniiidcr at her schedule,
niid prnying that the iiiidcrcnlcd out

is would lie humped off.

on the other hand, il Gl'innell ain-
erges at the top ol the list in solo con—
”'01, thcrc will be the usunl howl
among the experts that the Pioneer
were an "ensy schedule team," niid it
will not he without some cnuse. How-
ever, let it be remembered that Grin-
nell’s schedule while adm ingly con-
taining some or the weak sisters now,
was formidable looking enough at the
start of the season.

Then too tbs Pioneers’ card con-
tains two teams ‘Lhat no matter how
weak they are against other teams,
are stronger than “the insi ous thing"
when they‘ tackle Grinu‘cll. I refer to
Amos and Drake, age-old rivals oi the
Scarlet and Black. Also Gi'innell's
previous low rating in Valley circles
tends to steer away tile regular lead—
ers, who playing several intersectional
gsmcs hesidcs their center-once group,
have little desire or wasting on after—
noon beating a team that will givc
diem no prestige.
