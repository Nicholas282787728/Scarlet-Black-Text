The Gl'innell college indoor

track squad spent El disap—
pointing Weekend at the
Naperville. relays held at
North Central college, Sat-
urday, March 16, despite an
all»l'olllld improvement on‘ the
part of its relay teams.

The 2-mile relay team of
Schaleger, Bacchus, Covault and
Weldon turned in its best per—
tarmance tor the season, but
was unable to place higher than
third in this event.

Since this event was run in
heats, the placing determined
hy the lastest times, it was
.uniortunate tor the Grinnell
team that it was .placed in
the heat with the least com-
petition; and although out.
stripping is opponents liy
about 15 yards, it was still un-
able to equal the times ol the
more hittcrly contested heats

Thc 1/1-mile relay team of
Marsh. Abel, Castles and Shah
tcr placed in this event in a
licld oi Very stitt competition;
the encouraging tactor or this
pertormanre is that tor the iii-st
time this year the team was
good enough to tight every inch
ot the way with the winners
oi the event,

Track captain and hurdler
Joe Conley tailed to repeat

his winning performance in
the ail-yd. low hurdles ot the
indoor contcrence meet, losing
by a matter oi inches to Ynul
oi Cornell,rwhom he had de~
icated the previous week.

Once again shotputter Sam
Pctrott, who has turned in
consistently good performances
at practice sessions, tailed even
to equal his practice charts
and was unp‘laced in this event.
