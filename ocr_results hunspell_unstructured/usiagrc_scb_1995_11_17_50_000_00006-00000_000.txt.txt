riring a proposal to the White House about their policies on Hispanics, hearing
Maya Angelou speak, leading two classes in a protest against a professor, and
meeting Paul Simon (Dill) were only a few ofthe things Fred Mann ‘97 did
over the summer. And his career has only just begun.

Mann, who carries with him a long list ofawartis and leadership experience. spent the
summer in Washington, DC as one of47 students in the nation chosen for the Minority
Leaders Fellowship Frogram. The program seeks students of color with outstanding
academic and leadership experience to spend a summer with the Washington center, a
prestigious internship and Academic Seminar institute in DC.

The Frogi-am

Minority Fellows were required to spend time every week on a community service
proiect and attend a oneneeir leadership training program in addition to the usual
internship and seminar requirements that all program members must participate in.

"it was demanding because [the Minority Fellows] had more work to do," said Mann.
"We also were Expected to represent our ethnic communities as young leaders and as role
models."

Even with all this additional work, it isn’t suprising that Mann was also elected by 300
peers as Vice President ofstndents, Mann typically tackles a large workload and friends
often describe him as a gregarious person.

Vicerresidency

Being vice.i>tesident ofihe students in the Washington center was a tough position
because Mann’s fellowstudents expected a lot from him. Mann found that he was also new
to the program and didn’t always have the answers “They expected me to do stuffbecause
iwas the vice President,” said Mann. “They assume ifyou take on leadership you must have
all the answers. lfyou did not have answers, must fight in their cause I think that was one
of the hardest things for me to do, hecause people saw me not only as Fred the person, but
also asFred the vice President. and Fred as the Washington Center Representative. ifthey
were upset, they often laid it out on me, which I had no control over But i had to fulfill
responsibility as a representative of group."

Mann found that the responsibility ofthe position, however. taught him a lot about
how to be impartial, This played out when one of the program directors didn’t return
student calls. Many students had urgent issues and needed to talk to the director. Mann
was able to negotiate the misunderstanding with the director and inviie her to meet with
students for a weekend.

Additionally, being vice President prompted Mann to take action when the professor
ofhis seminar didn't reach.

The President and The Media

Mann’s summer seminar was about the President and the Media. Although the topic
had originally sounded interesting, Mann found that the professor wasn't serious about
teaching.

“Ir was in my seminar at Southeastern University that I saw the difference between
onnneil education and other schools. What startled me was that the professor placed
videos into the machine, That was his formofteaching He put in a video and left the class.
He really didn't discuss the information." said Mann.

It was disappointing for Mann to find that many ofhis fellow students were apathetic

about the professor’s lack of teaching Al—
though a few complained,
manyseemedcontentwith
not doing much work.

The Protest

After several repeat—
ed classes where the pro»
fessor iust played a video
and left the class, Mann
and a fellow student
drafted a letter in pro<

Center

Scarlet & Blair: Ii

 

February 1, 1995

Edda?

It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I nominate Fred
Mann for the Washington Center’s Minority Leadership
Fellowship Frogram. Fred Mann was the 1994 recipient
of the Mid-America Leadership Award which recognized his
“character, creativity, and commitment to Chicago commu-
nlties.” .. He is also founder and coordinator of the
Grinnell's Black Cultural Center Pathfinder Lecture
series. This is a lectureship series which brings an
African-American scholar to speak to students and faculty
at the Black Cultural Center on a monthly basis.

To Whom It May Concern:

I could continue to list Fred Mann’s achievements at even
greater length, but I would like to stress that he is one
of the most extraordinary, mature, and caring young men
that I have met in my twenty-two years in higher education.
He is serious and highly motivated, while at the same time
has a wonderfully positive attitude and a great sense of
humor. He has already become a leader among the entire
student body in the short time he has been at Grinnell.
I can think of no candidate I have ever known who I would
endorse more strongly for the Washington Center Fellowship
Program than I do Fred Mann.

sincerely,

cause I felt that we did not work, or perform, I didn’t think we deserved to get a grade in th
class when we didn‘t do any work. It made me realize how much Grinnell has ingrained it
me about the importance of professor and student interaction in a class. Students ani
professors have to work together in a learningenvironment. it's not just a watchinga vider
screen and taking notes. we weren't refuting or arguing topics. I never realized before hot
much I really expect from a professor.”

Although Mann had a solid case for protesting the professor's contract with th
Washington Center, he still wasn't sure how seriously the students would be taken. Thi
particular professorwas a graduate ofHarvard and a member ofWashingronpolirics for a loni
time. But after the letter was drafted, both classes the professor was teaching supported it
and the Washington Center didn't renew his Contracti

“it wasn't right for us to accept a good grade for that class," said Mann. "It also wasn’

right for another class ofsriidents to go through the same experience,"
Internship

A challenging internship made up for Mann's bad class experience The internship tha
he wanted with the Department or Health and Human services wasn’t lined up when he
arrived in Washington because the department wasn't accepting interns that summer
Luckily. the special assistant to the executive director reviewed Mann’s application anywal
and invited him to come in for an interview

“I explained to him thatl wanted tosee how the government works and understand more
about welfare," said Mann. “He decided their he would let work for summer.”

There, Mann worked at the Office ofCommunity Service in the Department of Healtl
and Human Services. The office is responsible for empowering poor communities in mm
areas to develop to be self.sufficient. Amazingly enough, the agency has a $4—billion annna
budget and 35 people working in the office, The agency worked with welfare money/7110i

other things.

Mann was given many large tasks, including writing a proposal for a nonviolenc
conference in Milwaukee next year, review giants, do research on welfare, and write
proposal for the white house.

“I learned what I could do. I was really nervous," explained Mann.

“But I learned that welfare has many different names to IL Welfare money is more rha
