“on The Corner”

"Although Hart's huchet at the
opening of the second half stretchr
ed the Grinnell load, the Scots
had drawn to within two points
after only three and a half min-
utes of the second half had elaps-
ed, After the Pioneers had
drawn ahead gain with free
throws by Waters and Millihen
and a goal by Vanstrum, Huber
put Monmouth hack into the game
with a huchct with nine minutes
to go.

Grinnell then matched huchet
for huchet until the score stood
38 to 35 with five minutes i-
maining. Then Waters sank rotu-
straight tree throws and a has
ket to send Grinnell into a Cm‘n-
manding 44-37 lead with less than
two minutes to go. Two free
throws by Hart and a haslret by
vanstr-um matched the final two
Scot goals.

It was a fast, exciting game,
and after Grinnell saw its huge,
caily lead melt, it fought hack
to snatch the game out of the
tire. Tod Kcnncfick did a notable
job in guarding Huber who hcat
Grinnell almost singlurhandedly
last year. This year he garnered
only {our goals, none of which
\vele easy.
