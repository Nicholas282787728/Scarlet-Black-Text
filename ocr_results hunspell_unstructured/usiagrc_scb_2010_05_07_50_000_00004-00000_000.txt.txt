To students who raised concern atJack's
seemingly sudden departure months ago,
her reappearance has eased anxieties and
frustration,

“It's just a matter, you get the students
here, but what can yott do to help retain the
students, especially from different socio
economic backgrounds. That was my rnarn
concern," Charisma Montfott '11 said.

When jacks was fired, Mention worked
extensively from her position as a Board
Member of the Conceined Black Students
group to petition admissions to find an ad-
equate replacement for her (See; The SE53,
2/19/2010).

Jacks said that in the past she had not
been able to make contact with as many
students as she would have liked. However,
she said her new position will give the time

to actively seek out students.

“Now, with my position, I'll be able
to work across campus," Jacks said, note
ing that she had already begun work with
the International students organization,

time at Gtinnelliagtcc that she was an cs-

“I would not be at Grinnell College if
it was not for Marlene Jacks," wrote Chl’
cagoan Scott Phillips ’11 in an e-mail. “She
gave me conﬁdence and instilled m me the
motivation to be all I can be. When I'm at
Grinnell and I see her on campus, it com-

journey that all started with a simple phone
call."

effect on many students.

“Marlene is still a huge factor in a lot of from p. 1

people staying here,”Montrort said, attribute

Bcrnal,]acks and Montfort all see a need
for Grinncll to expand the role or Jacks to
broader campus community

“The mission of educating students and
diversifying our campus should not be left tip

“She was already working with us in many
ways because of the emphases she had ptcvh
ously.l think we’re really eyeing an opportur
nity for her to maximize on her contribution
to the conununiry,"Bernril said.

Montfmt realizes the burden placed on
Jacks could be dispersed throughout the cur
tire campus.

“I don't feel like Marlene should be the
only person on campus in this position. and I
feel like everyone should he working towards
that goal," Montfort said.
