man of precise temperament. He Vit—
allzes Christianity as being the core
or human existence, and emphasizes
that it he accepted by those who have
too long been in doubt. As a scholar
he recognizes the facts of evolution,
but still sees Jesus as the goal for
which to strive. Although he professes
no absolutism in the Bible,, he draws
from it myriads of truths, with which
he moves the hearts of his listeners.
His mold and informed intellect have
stamped him as being the friend of ev~
ery genuine Christian. Dr. Fosdick
is famed also as being an author, ouite
aside from his persuasive oratorical
Powers. With Dr. Fosdick heading
the Conference. there can be no doubt
as to its being exceedingly successful.

lluuse Bleanlng in Y. Talk

Prof, Chas. N. Smiley spoke at the
weekly "Y" meeting Thursday night
before a building crammed with inte
ested listeners. He spoke of sincelll}
as applied to human behaviour. “it—
cues and heretics used to be burned at
the stake in all sincerity, but with
{in absolute lack of intelligence asto the
wlly and wherefore of the burning. in.
herited wisdom of today, such as we
possess, is full of veiled prejudice
and ubscul‘ed vision, and we must ap-
ply intelligence to its sincerity if we
are to be successful.

“Have an intellectual house cleaning
and clear your conscience of prejud—
iced thoughts. No one is so in danger
as he who knows not himself; such
is the type of man who is always to
be found in favor of mol) Violence and
who resents any attempt at intellectual
sincerity."

Prof. Smiley concluded his talk
with examples from his reminiscences
of recent tours through italian cities,
among which ,were included Naples,
and also of s. v'lslt through the Ru-
man Form.

No Immediate Action Expected at
Grinuell Sayings; Whole Situation
Still Very Uncertain.

With Lhose in charge unwtlling to
commit themselves on the latest bank
developments, the only hope for de-
positors in the closed banks comes
from the rumor that the Merchants
National will Dpen soon with the aid
of outside capital. There is not even
2|. well founded rumor concerning the
situation at the savings, so there is
little probability of action there for
some time,

The Merchants, which has been
making a definite attempt to rem‘gan»
izc, seems at last headed for success
if the information which has leaked
out from its closed door is reliable.

' Meeting with failure in its local effort

to sell stock in a. new bank, the de-
positors committee will likely throw
the field open to outside capital, Ac-
cording to the rumor, men in Chi»
cngo are anxious to invest in the Mer-
chants,
may be done before long.

If the bank did open up with outside
capital the amount that the depositors
Would receive would be uncertain.
However. in spite of favorable
ports, the whole situation is up in the
air and there is no definite assurance
that either of the closed banks will
open in the near future.

Poem by Elizabeth Collin-t1 Oviisiilt-r l
Gotltl—“Bldtirsburg Sketches"
Attract . ttoulion.

By Bernard Craven

The Felli‘uul'y issue of “Junta” brings
us a. number of things in the w
of writiligﬁamong them three short
stories, a page of verse, and a satire.
0f the stories, the one by Mary Mat-
lack '27. is the best because of the at.
titude of the tale, expressed in her
style. “Dear Diana." by Loren D.
Reid lacks importance. Harriet Rust
26, has an idcftin“Plloenix" but it
lacks display; the end is also slightly
confused.

The real piece of the magazine is the
poem by Elizabeth Canard :25.
Here the poetry of a com-
mon experience is delightfully pictur-
ed.
Murray, ‘27. is very- worthy, but her

“My love for You" is not worth the'

time it took to print it. Mary Jane
Miller, '25. Ann Egan. and May Lee
also contribute to the poetry corner.

"Blalrsburg Sketches,“ after the
manner of Edgar Lee Masters, by Mar-
guerite Merryman '25, which seem to
be causing quite a stir in campus gos-
sip. are brilliant in spots, but they tend
to be merely “telling things on peo-
pie." The needed insight in order to
give the proper perspective is miss.
lng. Margaret Stuart's “Nashua
Sketches" show a rural niceness
which is attractive, especially in “Tib.
lion's Cale.”

And ,last. the “Aw G’wan to Bed
Time Story” by ha Verne B. Herring.
It is a satire written in the usual
manner of the author which displays
a fullness of characterization and pre—
sents an original idea in criticism for

Grinnell publications, though this par.V

ticuliir piece lacks somewhat the de-
tached view-point, necessary for such
writing.

0n the whole, the magazine smacks
of freshman English, being in the na-
ture of assigned exercises with-
out inspiration. In an in -
terview with the editor, he states that
the magazine ought to call forth moi'cl
stories and poems showing the genu<
ine interests of the college along liter-
ary lines.

Will Rogers is peeved. The Prince
of “lales recalls that he got the “thrill
of a lifetime" during his stay in Amen
ica out of the Chicago Stockyards and
Will Rogers. At which Will himself
remarks plaintively, “He might htve
mentioned me before the hogs "

Morgan Taylor appears on the All-
American track team of 1924, by vlr»
lure of his Olympic Victory. The Des
Moines Trihunehews has the follow—
ing to say regarding the selections.

“Secretary Frederick W. Rubien 0f
the Amateur Athletic Union, in se~
lectlng his all-American all-colegi-
hte and allrsclloul boy track and
field team for the Spalding athletic
almanac, appears to have departed

from his policy of from

past performances, for four men ap—

pear where Ioren Murchison
alone in the dashes a year Ago.

"The 1925 list seems to have been
picked for its ability to engage in
actual combat with all comers. Only
nine whose names were mentioned
in the last previous selections are
returned to their positions and Bob
Legendre of the Newark A. c. and
Harold Osborn of the Illinois A. C.
are the only athletes named for two
events on the all-American team,
eucuarlcy Brooklns, Clarence De.
mar, William Plant, Irving Reed,
Tom Lieb and Fred Tontell retain
the positions for which they were
chosen in 1924. Joie Ray is dis -
placed asking of American milers
for the first time in eight years,
losing his crown to Ray baker but
remaining in the list as two-mile
champion.”

it is interesting to know now the
alumni feel toward the success of the
football teltm last fall. and especial.

a coach. Tire following “recommen-
dation" was written by H. L. Beyel
’95. Chairman of the Athletlc Advisory
Committee, Grinnell Graduate council.
Responsible for Success.

“Mr. M. w. Hylltnd, familiarly known
as “Mike" Hylfmd, prominent attorney
of Tania, iowa. one of the best all.
around athletes ever developed at the
University of Iowa, successful coach
‘ of football teams at Leander Clark Col-
lege, Toleda, Iowa. and Highland Park.
Des Moines, by magnificent and lnspii'»
ing leadership and a keen knowledge
of the modern game, was the man
most responsible for the success of
the 1924 eleven at Grinuell, which was
one of the best that ever represented
the Scarlet and Black. The team by
its consistent, hard, clean playing not
only delighted its own supporters on
every gridiron last season. but at sev—
eral games played away from Grinnell.
it won the hearty approval and ap-
plause ot the spectators not directly
interested in the result of the contests.
That this was so is a high compliment
both to the coach and lo the eleven
and it was a noteworthy feature of the
One Game at Cedar Rapids and the
game with Creighton at Omaha, The
games of 1924 clearly proved that
Grinnell teams are capable of playing
high class football, amply entitling the
College to membership in the Missouri
Valley Conference, when afforded com.
petent coaching and real leadership in
the person of the coach.

“A Lender of Ion”

“Hyland is a genuine leader of men.
He is interested in manhood for its
own sake as is shown by his work with
boys, and on the school board at Toma,
He inspires loyalty and selfrdenial on
the part of the men under him. He has
proved himself a builder of character.
The victories over Coo and Ames were
won by sheer courage, determination,
and skill of a high order.

“The inertia of several disastrous
seasons had to be overcome and an ef-
fective system of play and general-
ship developed, Hyland admirably
met these demands and the future of
football under his leadership at Grin-
nell is brilliant ni prospect, based as
it is on the accomplishment of the
season just closed."

[iiiute Expected to he Harderoughl:
From Start to Finish—ll ldmts
Have Brilliant Rewrd.

The Pioneers meet the first severe
test of the season tonight when they
play the strong Kansas Aggie quintet.
Upon the outcome of the game tonight
will depend whether or not Grinnell is
to be a prominent candidate for the
top of the percentage column.

As the dope stands. the two teams
are about evenly matched despite the
phenomenal victory of the Wildcats
over Kansas, and a win for the Pin-
neers tonight would mean that in all
probability Grinnell will finish among
the Valley leaders at the end of the
season. Although the Scarlet and
Black team was defeated by Drake
who was in turn badly beaten by the
Aggies. Coach Black seems to have got
his men out of the temporary slump
they were in when they lost to the
Bulldogs. and two evenly matched.
teams should face each other when the

The Pioneers also have one man on

Wing was hurt early this week, and in

for use for another week. He and
Winter are both equally good as back
guards. but the loss of Wing leaves

The rest of the team is in good

able to hit the basket as regularly to.
