New'lmage In Oberlin-PE

by Dave Calvert

There’s something radically diff»
erent going on in the Physical Ed!
ucation department at Oberlin Cole
lege. Oberlin is a small, liberal
arts, co-educational college in
Ohio » well, maybe you've heard
of it already. Jack Scott, selected as
Athletic Director at Oberlin in 1972,
has brought about a series of en-
anges in both the philosophy and ac-
tual policies of the school’s sports
program. ,
In his, The Athletic Revolution,
Scott called for “selfrdiscipline”,
as opposed to “authoritarian discir
pline", and ”participation," as ops
posed to a "win at all costs”
program. He advocates sports ess-
entially tor the sell-lull'lllment oi
the athlete, not the spectator.
Scott’s first moves after assuming
his position at Oberlin angered much
or the school’s faculty, while excit-
ing many students, No longer were
admission tees to he charged at
school sports events, although it
had, apparently, been a siguiiicant
money-making operation beiore
Scott’s arrival, Players were now
to have veto power in the hiring of

coaches, Rather than having scared
oil coaching prospects, Scott seems
to have attracted more and better
coaches. Cass Johnson, the first
black head football coach at a pre
dominantly white institution (that’s
right, the first), was the lirst to
survive the players scrutiny. The
second was Tommie Smith. ltes,

the Tommie Smith ,, the one who
has been kicked around by organized
athletics since his black-gloved,
raised list stance on the 1968 Maxi
ico City olympics zoo-meter vic—
tory stand. He’s the newtrack coach
and assistant athletic director.

leader Of The Pack

by Mark Blanchard

Two years ago Grinnell’s cross
country team was undefeated induel
meets. Running near the back or
the pack that year was a thin free
shman named Dave Raul). Despite
Raub's unmatched dedication, he
never placed among the top finishr
ers. Much of the season Raub stru-
ggled with the ellecls oi an internal
injury.

In face of a summer illness and
a nuke injury acquired early in the
cross country campaign, Raub se-
cured a varsity position in his so-
ohornore year. He. along with Bob

Grid Opponents loom Tough

by Tom Sherrell
Grinnell's varsity football season
opens one week ’irom tomorrow
with an exhibition game against
Coe at Cedar Falls. The diminuar
tive Pioneers will be facing a Stir
uad numbering over 100 players.
Coe has twentyriour returning lets
termen and will be led by two of
last year’s midwesl conference
leaders.
The toughest teams Grinnell will
'be facing appear to be Monmouth
(last year's Midwest Conference
ctﬁmp with a 9-0 record) and St.
Olal. Monmouth also has over 100
players this year withthreeslourths
or last year's starting deieusive

unit returning. St. Olal's squad is
smaller than either Coe's or Mon»
mouth‘s, but is still at least double
the size oiGrinnell's, ottense seems
to betthe "Ole's" torle, with two
good ends and seven veteran runs
ning backs returning

Outstanding players on the Grins
nell practice iield appear to be
lreshmen Walt Pearcey and Mark
Schultz, both backs. Pearcey has
been exceptional both on oilense
and deiense, and both players have
good speed and moves. The start-
ing quarterback spot is still up lor
grabs, with sophomore Paul Sonar
tar and ireshmen Paul Delaney and
Dave Wopat vying lor the position.

backing up lead man Dari Hildebrand.
Today, with Hildebrand and Brown
out o! the picture, and with an in»
luryrlree season looming, Raub has
moved in to the number oneposition.

EVldentally leellng the responsibili-
ty or his position, Raub has step»
ped up his daily workouts. Over
the period or a week Raub runs
15-20 miles more than the rest of
the team.

Raub’s late success may be traced
lo the 1973 indoor track season.
In each race Raul) showed marked
improvement and began to build a
reputation around the Midwest Con-
When the outdoor season

Coach Ray Obermiller is extremer
ly pleased with Raub’s periormance,
“Dave has come a long way in the
past couple of years, despite all
the trouble he’s had'with injuries,”
commented Ohermiller. “I think
he's cut oil 25 seconds from his
37mlle time, if not more He’s
really improved."

The crosscountry season will bee

angular meet against Coe and Cor-

bet that Dave Raul) will be ready
