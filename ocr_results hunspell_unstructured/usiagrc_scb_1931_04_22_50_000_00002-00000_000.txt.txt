A SIGNIFICANT STEP

Griullell college trustees, ill electing Drml
Nollcn acting president of the college Monday,
carried out, it lllovr which was expected of them.
The assumption that llr. Nollcll would succeed
J. H. T. Main to the president’s chair was pntcllt
upon the cdmpus. .

Perhaps it is not within the realm of fl college
newspaper to comment upon the proceeding. The
advent of Dean Nollcn to the posi loll calls for a
little more than silent applause, however. Ill this
day, when the president of {1 small college must be
a business lnizlll {1nd a collector as well, it is signiﬁ
cant that Grinncll trustees should sec ﬁt to place
the reins of the institution ill the hands of fl man
who is heart and Soul an educator.

It would have been hard to ﬁnd all 'where.
since the death of President Main, 21 man with more
devotion to Grinnrll, more thoroughly stcepcd ill
the Scholastic traditions of the college. Just 10
years younger than the former hcfld of the insti-
tutio , Mr. Nollen has already devoted 20 yell of
service to th 5 college and ill addition has served
for another decade as president of Lake Farest
university.

Grillncll has a man of national prominence at
its hood again, Whatever the move may mean to
ﬁnances or to endowments. no one can deny that
it would have tdlrcu it long search to ﬁnd it better
man to keep Gl'iunell at top l' ll: scholastically.
That which the new ac 11g president Hilly do. and
whether or not he succeeds is not to be considered
now. Whatever he does will be for the best in
tercsts of Grinncll college.

WHAT PRICE TEAMS

Studcnts and alumni have for many years becn
of the opinion that a winning football team meant
an advance, in tllc enrollment of El college. Grill-
nell students and alumni are no exception. Sol
llIctzgar, famous both as a football playcr and
coach, cut o swath ill the ranks of supportc ' of
the theory recently when he wrote all article which
was published ill a popular magazine, cxplodil 0.
what he calls “the football fallacy ”

Mr. Metzgar wrote or directly interviewed the
administrative, academic7 and athletic directors of
more than 80 colleges and universities, asking,
“What, do victorious football teams actually will
for the schools they represent?” I-Iis discoveries are
surprising.

The University of Chicago is a startling ex-
ample. \Vhilc Coach Alonzo A. Stagg has been the
grand old man of football for many years, the
university ill recent. ycdl has turned ollt teams
which lost consistently. Yet, with numerous dcfcdts
on the gridiron. it steady growth in students zuld
endowments continues.

Notrc Dome is frequently pointed to as an ex
ample of zln institution which football built. AS
a matter of fact, the Irish elcvcll cdmc into prom-
illencc in 1924. In 1923-24. the year before the
school rose to its grclltc.t heights on tllc football
ﬁeld, the enrollment had been 512 under dual ‘
In 1925-26, the year following that glol ous ycar
on the gridiron, the enrollment was 365. In the
year preceding 1924, the increase had been 255.
Since that time. the arcl gc annual increase over ll
ﬁve year period has been 200.

Many Grillllcll college students remember the
Centre college football records Set between 1919
and 1924. The Little Colonels took the head-lines
all over the country when they snatched an un-
cxpectcd victory over IIdrvord, Tile increase in
enrollment the following your was 16.

This is not a plea for a losing team. It costs
just as much to support o losing clevcn as it does
it winning team and doesn’t give llcorly the satis-
faction. Grinncll has done well, however, in not
losing sight of scholarship in a mod race for feet
ball honors.

ARE COLLEGIANS PEOPLE
(From the New York Daily News)

Some rollicking new acts are added to the Prohibi-
tion Follies of 1931. Collegians are coming in for their
share.

The University of Minnesota suspends 17 students
for drinking. Five University of Michigan fraternity
houses have been padlocked, with students suspended,
Two coed and three men students were expelled from the
University of Oregon for drinking, The names of the
three men were made public, presumably in the hope
that they would feel disgraced, Names of the girls were
withheld. We don’t know why, There's no sex distinction
in drinking.

This writer asked a young lady, who’s just reached
her eighteenth birthday, if there had been drinking at
a recent weekend party given by Harvard law and medi-
cal students, supposedly the more serious grads.

“Lots of it," she replied.

The thing we can’t understand is, why discriminate
against students? Most young people between 19 and 20
drink at parties in the more civilized sections of the
country, That can't be denied, Clerks and sales girls
aren’t ﬁred Monday if they’ve been drinking at a Satur-
day night party. They're only ﬁred if they don't appear
at work. But students are expelled, and deprived of
training for earning a livelihood, Simply because they
drink whether they are crack scholars or not. What
stupid nonsense!

Political faculties seem to think they frighten stu—
dents into being good little drys, They don't know stu-
dents. Eve‘rytime they can a student for taking a drinh,
they'll just make a lot of other students drink just: to
show they’re hellers. That's human nature and that’s
what prohibition never took account of.

students show that. Down in the good bourbon state
of Kentucky a state university student was expelled
from his fraternity by his brothers because he threatened
to turn dry informer, That was natural. Fraternity
would end if a brother couldn't mix ginger ale and the
makings without another brother rushing to the phone
and calling the flat-feet.

Professional drys make a great fuss over the fact
that a few of the expelled students were bootleggers.

in the old days, students helped poorer friends to
get an education by giving them jobs as waiters, tutors,
etc. Now they patronize them as bootleggers, a modern
development of the old kindly feeling.

The most sensible view from a college professor
we‘ve heard came from President Ernest M. Hopkins
of Dartmouth. “They shouldn't raid college fraternities
unless they are going to raid country clubs” he said.
He's right.

is — Such a business!

OPTIMISM AT SOUTHERN UNIVERSITIES
(From the Washington University Student Life)

During the past Week We have bEerl down South on
a debating tour, visiting four universities Three of them
Were Small. All of them were rather much in need Df
funds. Failures in the cotton Crop, low price in oil, and
the general business depression apparently had made
serious inroads in the wealth of the average student.
The cultural opportunities were not to be compared to
that offered by the proximity of a. large and fully de-
veloped city such as Saint Louis. Denomi ntlonal control
in two of the schools forbade fraternities and social
dancing. One had a Sort of norsmoklng rule for men. The
general academic level was probably that of a good
preparatory school.

But the strange thing was the optimism of these
institutions and their eagerness to work with the meager
materials that were at hand, At one place the turnout
for football had been slight, but that fact failed to
daunt the coach; he had apparently gone right ahead
with enthusiasm; and had won the Southern champion-
ship. At another place the whole debating squad con»
sisted of four men, but the Coach had a dynamic hope
for a more brilliant future, and had gone about doing
the best he could with the existing material. Through
the gamut of university activitiesiacademic and other-
Wisegthere was apparently an enthusiasm which was
remarkable in the face of conditions which would have
plunged almost anyone at Washington into despair.

While searching selfrcritiusm is a. thoroughly de‘
sirable thing in any university, and mere doltish Polly-
annaism is insufferable, one must not lose sight of the
larger situation and reilize that Washington univer-
sity's virtues far exceed her faults.
