Theatre Production

The Grinnell College Theatre, under the direction of Bruce R, Halverson,
will this weekend present an exhibit in theatrical Contrast, At 8 p.m, in
Roberts Theatre, Par Lagerkyist’s "The Secret of Heaven” and Moliere’s
“The Doctor in Spite of Himself” will be performed tonight and tomorrow
night,

The first of the plays reveals a deep pessimism about man's condition in
a dark, non—communicative atmosphere. The setting is a miniature planet
which is a synthesis of the larger world and where people are hopelessly
Isolated from one another. On the other hand, Moliere’s play gaily ex»
presses social criticism in a tale about a greedy father trying to arrange
a profitable marriage for his daughter. The Sets were designed by James
E. Reeder III of the theatre faculty.

I One‘Alumnus looks Back

by Lynne Ogawa

It’s a lot of firsts for Ron Stanford
"ll (History); he's become husband,
sports editor, photographer and edu-
cation writerwall within three
months. His marriage in January
started the chain. While waiting for
his wife Fay to complete her last
semester here, Ron took an opening
with the Grinnell Herald-Regis-
ter. It turned out to be quite a slot,
too, that of a sports and education
writer for the community.

Ron never followed athletics very
closely but didn’t experience diffi-
culty with the jargon. As editor, he
covers a wide range of activities--
from community recreations pro-
grams to Grinnetl intercollegiate
meetSrvwhich, he says, makes im-
possible inrdepth coverage, He
feels good sports write-ups require
a lifetime devotion and considers
good sportswriters to be “some of
the best journalists,"

As for his start in photography,
“they just handed me a camera and
told me to start taking pictures,”
says Ron. So by a trial and error
process, taking a lot of shots at
different exposures, he usually man-
ages to do pretty well.

Feature-writing is closer to Ron’s
interests because it involves talking
to people, His job with the Herald-
negister gives him the opportunity
to do features and meet some people
at the same time, “There’s a lot of

dinerent kinds of people in town,”
says Ron.

He’s had some experience with feae
tul‘es dating back to his 1969770
SCARLET AND BLACK reporting.
However, he finds the idea of aGrin-
nell College newspaper or yearbook
“silly"; it’s an “artificial imposi-
tion" and "outmoded form of com»
municatiou,”

Referring to the newspaper speciiie
Cally, he states, f‘I don't think it re—
ilects the student body. it mainly
deals with issues students aren’t
interested in.” At a small place
like Grinnell, Ron feels all people
have to do is put up a notice about a
lecture or Concert and students will
read it,

Ron finds it a “completely different
world when you’re not connected with
the college.” He explains that Grin-
nell students take for granted their
stay is temporary, and they think it's
okay to be here If ”you’re not gonna
be here all the time.” But he’s
become conscious or “3,000 people
who don’t wait for spring break”
and “a lot of people who are really
happy here."

This does not mean Ron rabidly
avoids the campus. 0n the contrary,
he attends lectures, concerts and
maintains his close college friends
ships. “1 just don’t hang around the
forum and see the same periphery or
occasional friends."

Looking back on his student days,
Ron says, “The major things I re-
member about Grinnell aren’t the

Saga Nutritionist, Reports

The long~awaited report of Mrs,
Frances McMillan, a professional
nutritionist who evaluated food ser-
vice in Cowles and Quad, is in.
Mrs. McMillan Visted the dining
halls twice, once shortly before
Christmas break, and once after.
The bulk of her report is a compi-
lation of nutritional Value in a num—
ber of key areas of the food served
during the several meals on those
days, in terms of two national stan-
dards. These were the Minimum
Daily Requirement, of cereal box
fame, and the Recommended Dietary
Allowance, published by the National
Research Council.

The report generally spoke highly
of the nutritive value of the food

served by saga, saying that, if
properly eaten, it would fulfill all
normal body requirements, Parr
ticularly favored were the optional

supplements such as brewer's yeast,
and wheat germ,

Mrs. McMillan recommended the
use of iodized rather than the rogue
lar salt now being served,

It was noted in the report that to
get the most out of the wide variety
of items available, the student
needed to choose his.diet intelli-
gently. A valuable aid to doing so
would be the report itself, avail-
able for all Interested persons to
examine in the office of the college
business manager,

Choose KDIC, 5&3 Staffs ‘

The Committee on Student Publiv
cations and Radio announced shortly
before spring break that John Seeley
has been appointed Station Manager
for KDIC next year. Seeley, a three»
year DJ for the station, has .served

Public Affairs. He has had pro-
fessional radio experience in Rapid

school year were Mike Stern as

Sparks as Chief Engineer. The
position of KDIC Business Manager

Program Director positions have

who was appointed as engineer for
the third consecutive year. noted
that he is beginning to think of the
other staff members as “temporary
help,”

The Committee also appointed
Merry Wiesner as Managing Editor
of the 1972773 Scarlet and Black

sively in the area of newspaper

year’s ShB and has held the position
of Associate Editor.

classes " Ron got excited about a
few courses and putting on concerts,
but "I never felt Very active, like I
was doing something.” “I learned
more when I was out than in.”

After this semester, Ron is uncer-
tain about the future His brother
runs “a kind of muckraking" news
paper which Ron is sort ofinterested
in. Graduate school lS another p05-
slblity, though he does not want to
continue in History.

Folklore holds his interest more,
”lt’s a nebulous word, but it’s
taught as a discipline, Basically it
Studies processes which are trans-
mitted face to face, whether it's
playing pool or the banjo.” He cites
fairy tales, work ballads and pro-
verbs as some traditional folklore.

But untraditional folklore is more
to Ron’s liking. He finds it hard to
define and just describes it as ”the
processes of work” and “how peor
ple work with their hands.”

To further explain, Ron gave his
experience with the Smithsonian In-
stitute. As part of his job, Ron went
to New York City, climbed up Sky-
scrapers - in . the - making, asked
workers for some good jokes about
the trade and taped the replies.

“It turned out they had a Whole body
of oral literature that’s jokes, rules
of conductﬁjust how to do things,”
He considers their oral literature
“a much more living folklore” than
the diminishing ‘hasketweavings’ of
traditional folklore festivalsl

He also commented on the irony of
the situation: The skyscrapers are
dehumanizing everyone except those
who built them; the workmen ex-
tract 3 rich and living tradition from
glass and Steel.
