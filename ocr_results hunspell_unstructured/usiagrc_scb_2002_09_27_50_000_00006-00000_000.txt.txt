[I realize] that the rock
savior that I am looking
for will never arrive. The
media is not willing to
look past what’s on the
surface to see what lies

September 27, 2002

ro rlre diverse audienee rirar loves rlrern ioday. i feel rirar summer/sew
is more ofe Benner: record rlrnn aTrveedy record, bur ir is always
undersrood rim ieff'l'weedy is wileo.

During sire sessions for vim/es Heel Foxn-ol, Bennerr's duillue
siorrrnenr \vllh \vilco reaclred a pealc, end ire quit rire band. He ima
medraiely hooked up widn longrime friend Bdwmd Bureli and re.
edrded m Pill/1r: er 4 run , released. ironically, on rire same day as
l/rmtce Hotchotht in [he midsr ofsdversiry, he remained rrue ro
iris arrisric inregriry, end relersed abcaue
riful and powerful reeord (ro demone
srrare wirar role lie played in wileo,
compare the boring, simplistic version
of “Shaking sugar" from rlie Yon/at:
Holt/Favn'atsesslons, wirir rne explo.
sive, excising version on T/Ief’nldttmé‘
em. Tire same goes wirir “Venus

lr made me realize rirar rire roels
savior rirar I am loolcirrg for will never
arrive. Tire media is non unlling so look
pasr wliar's on (he surreee to see what
lies below. lfl sew Jay Bennerr on rlre
Late Show. or doing an inrerview on CNN (as l sew JeffTweedy, in
riie lesr week), i don’r know wiser I'd do. no Pal/II: (1:411. m, would
