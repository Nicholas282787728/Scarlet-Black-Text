Public snonhliig iuiil Driiiiatic -t A

Is Seliill'aicil iroiii Course In
Philosophy.

A reorganization within a iiumbcr
of the departments oi the college cult
riculurn is indicated in the new catar
logue issued during the past week.

The courses under Prof. Ryan have
been separated from the English der
partincnt and are now catalogucd to-
gether under a dopartmcnt oi public
speaking and dramatic art. Psychol-
ogy and philosophy havc also been
placed in two distinct dopartmcnts.
Economics and business admin [i'ar
tion, although still under the same
heading. are more ci‘caily deﬁned in
scope.

Among the changes to individual
courscs, it is interesting to notc that
French A iiill hcrcaitcr he a ﬁve-
hour coursc throughout the your and
‘Fi‘cnch n has hccn eliminated cn-
tii-cly. History or philosophy, which
has iormcrly talicii two hours, will
he a LIii'ccrhour coursc and may co
stituto tho group rcouiicincnt in phi
osophy or psychology. Horticulture
has hcon atlmittod as part or the
major or minor requirements in
hotany. A new course givcii jointly
hy the departments or history, cco—
iiomlcs and political science is one
titicd nuhlic alfau‘s survey.

one of the most successful American
concert baritone, He has established
an unique placc lor himsclr in ora-

enthusiasm. Perhaps his most noted
success, or rathcr long list or suc-

tho tour of the New York Philhar-

point in Mr. Dadinim's career is the
tact that he has done all hi studying
in this country. He is, in short, an
cntirely American product.
