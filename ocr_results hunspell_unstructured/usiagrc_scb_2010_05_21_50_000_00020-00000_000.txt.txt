Mlho mil research the ré’é

 

Though most humanities majors rend to steer clear of the giant
laboratory known as Noyce, a select few brave its depths in search of
knowledge that will actually get shem a job. Among these few is winnon
Brunson Jr, a philosophy major tiom st. Louis.

“1 ﬁrst came into Grinnell really interested in ore-med. I thought
1 was going to he a science maior but I took a philosophy class and then
contemporary ethics and l .
really love the way that you ,
can connect science with
philosophy So 1 majored in
philosophy because I really
enjoy bioethics e that’s like
the main thing that I’d been
interested in hefore,"l3runson said.“l thought of it as away of merging two
totally unrelated ﬁelds together."

anson would like to do away with the image or she armchair
philosopher, putting on a cigar and reading Nietzsche but never backing
up their conjecture wish fact.

“I really enjoy she liberal arts approach to education, but even though
we’re a liberal arts school the sciences arewhat really dominates the campus
and as a philosophy major and being in the science department sometimes
certain majors don't get the respect thatl thinkthey deserve,"Bninson said.

Brunson has combined an interest in medicine with his philosophy
classes to create something uniquely his own. At a summer internship
at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sdenoes, a branch of
NIH,he was able to combine his interests.

“Basicallywe—it‘ssomethingtotallynddwhenyousluriltaboutit—it's
research on research misconduct policies, so it’s research on research. It’s
basically philosophy research, but it’s using an empirical approach, using

that. so I surveyed over 500 journals all across the globe and we tried to
look at different ways in which they have misconduct policies and how
they handle those and we tried to look at cultural factors, maybe it‘s their
nationality that affects their research misconduct policy And so when it
got published it wasjust something big ﬁor me," Brunson said. “It vimsjust
really cool, because is was using philosophy and doing a research project
where you can use an empirical method, so someone can': say I just sat
around on a chair and thought ofit,l actually have data to back it up:

Brunson, who is also a Truman scholar, will study at public health and
imrnigzants’access to healthcare at the University of Copenhagen nun year
on a Fulbright scholarship. Afterwards, he plans to get a masters degree
at the University of North Carolina hapel Hill’s public health program.
Eventually, he will either get a Ph. public health or go to med school.

“The thing l’m really hoping to do with whatever degree I get from
public healsh is to work in racial or eshnic minority neighborhoods
and act as a health consultant, and that’s as someone who's a liaison
between she patient and the medical system, someone that kind ofhelps
them understand like this is why it’s important to take your meds as a
certain hour," Brunson said. “It’s basically making sure that the patient is
empowered in she process, knowing which questions to ask and just things
like that."

Brunson would also encourage others to think outside of the box when
ll comes to their academic career.

“I think the biggest thing that really smnds out for me is that a lot of
the things that I’ve accomplished or that I’ve taken part of here I've taken
a very nontraditional path. And sometimes it seems really discouraging,"
Brunson said. “I think the biggest thing to know is that ifyou have a
passion or ifyou have a dream or something to go for it, even ityou have
professors sitting there saying the odds are against you."
