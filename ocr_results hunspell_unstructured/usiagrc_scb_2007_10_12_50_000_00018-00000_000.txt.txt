Will football’s second half be stronger?

So far: It’s been a difficult start to the sear
son for the Grinnell College football team.
Aside from a win at home against Lawrence on
Sept. 22, the Pioneers have not finished a game
within 20 points of their opponent. Granted,
three of the Pioneer's losses have come against
the top three teams in the league, meaning
that the Pioneers will face easier opponents for
most of the last four weeks of their schedule.

Key Performances: Good or bad, the Pics
neers have vet to establish a runninz ame

revolving around one person. Todd Dole-
shal '08 leads the rushing attack, but has only
one—third of the Pioneers total rushing yards.

On defense: Linebacker John Her-
eford ’10 leads the defense with 69 tackles,
but as a whole, the defense has been unable
to get to the opposing quarterback, net-
ring only five sacks (0 their opponenrs 15.

Upcoming Schedule:

ocr. 27—Ripon (home)

What to expect: Barring a Stanfordr
esquc performance, Lake Forest (H, 2.3
MWC) looks like rhe only winnnble game of
rhe ihrce. They beat Lawrence by nearly rhe
same margin as Grinnell (30719). The others
are tougher. Illinois College heat Knox llro
(Gl‘lnnell lost 38-7) and Ripon is the MWC’s
other power player. Expecr a win versus Be»
loit on Nov. 3, though, to cap offthe season.

Key Performances: As long as they’re
playing conference opponents, the Pioneers
are playing quite well on both sides of the ball.
Andrew Stephenson '10 is ried for the league
lead in goals with eight, while the Grinnell
defense has allowed the lowest amount ofgoals
in rhe league, giving up only 1.25 per game.

Upcoming Schedule:
Oct. 13-—:lt Lake Forest

Oct. ZO—at Illinois Wesleyan
OCL 27-—at Lawrence

Oct. 287 at St. Norbert

What to expect: Griiinell should roll
through their next two games in prepamtion
for their lasr and biggest two games ofthc sea-
son. Given Grinncll's high goal differential,
two wins there (cntiiely possible) Will give the
ream the regular season contcrenec title.

Volleyball
So far: The women's volleyball team is in ‘il
rebuilding yeai,with firstryears making up the
majority of the team. Their record so far has
been 3-19 overall and 14 in MWC. However,
two ofthosc wins have come in their last three
matches, including an impressive win over

Monmouth (ll-6,2-3).

Women’s Soccer
50 For: The women’s soccer team has been
ﬂying high during the conference season af-
tern slow non»confercncc start. Asldc from a
loss last weekend to Carroll, the Pioneers have
been rolling through their opponents, includ
ing 12~0, 9~0 and 10-1 victories.

What to expect: With Grinnell already der

a tough, but wiiinable test for the Pioneers.
But the team will have to look to pull off the
upset in its other games.

Cross Country

So far: Both the men’s and women's cross
country teams have been performing very well
this season. The women’s team tied for first
at the Les Duke InVitational and is currently
ranked fourth in the Central Region and 25th
in the counrry, with runners Sarah Spencer '08
and Allison Louthan '08 leading the way with
stellnr finishes in every evenr.The men's ream

What to cxpccr: More success. Barring
freak accidents or Cilf breakdowns, both cross-

lege Invitational and should also repeat at the
MWC Championship on ocr.27.
