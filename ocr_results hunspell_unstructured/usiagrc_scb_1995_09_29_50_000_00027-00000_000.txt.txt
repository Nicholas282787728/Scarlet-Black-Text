Ar the advent of Title IX. in
1972, 2% ofall college athletes were
vomen. These numbers have grown
exponentially inthelnsrrwentyyeois,
ut women still have not made a
ruly equitable inroad into the male
ominated field of athletics. As re—
orted In 1993, only 20% of the
verage athletic department’s oper—
ting budget was spent on women.
Only about 20% ofall athleticscholr
arships went to women, and only
15% of the recruiting budget was
allocated for women athletes (Cone
gresslonal Record, March 3, 1993, p.
H999),

Title IX brought a more scmti—

Sports in our society: the need
for female leadership in sports

ties opened up in a field dominated
and defined by men. Men haveexpe—
rience playing and coaching higher
level athletics and therefore have
received the tnoiority of coaching
positions, even the Jobs of coaching
women's teams. The numbetofwomr
en coaching women’s teams have
fallen. In 1972, 90% of all coaches
for women’s sports were women.
Today, the number has dropped to
48% (Congressional Record, March
3,1993,p,H999).

Women are not men, just as
women's athletics are not men‘s.
Professor Ana Martinez Aleman, a
former women’s softball coach at
SUNYeBinghampton, recalls the fact
that she had to argue hard for budget
money to buysports bras for her team.
“There was money in the budget for
the men‘s jOCkS, but they couldn‘t
seem to find the money to buy our
bras," she recalls. For some reason,
sports bras are not seen as truly “ath—
letic" equipment, just as women are
not seen as true athletes when they
are judged according to a male stanr
datd.

But what about those Nike con-i»
mercials urging women to play sports,
and highlighting the self—esteem,
power, and sheer happiness that can
be found in athletics! What about
the millions of women whose lives
have been rrnristorrneo by their pan
ticipati'on imports? Itseemsobvious
that women are true athletes, in their
own right.

To further women’s ability and
selﬂesreem, then, it seems necessary

' up, start moving, and give her broth

to use female coaches for women’
athletics. This isnot tosaythat male
coaches shouldnor be hired Coach
as should be hired because they at

because they have a certain pairin

of the women’s soccer and basketbal
