CREATIVE WORK
One of the fundamental purposes or
the liberal arts college

Iage creative work and this is achieved,

thru various methods. One or the
easiest and at the some time one of
the most elteotive means is by the
various contests tor creative and ori-

ginal work that are being conducted

by the various departments or the

, college.

Outstanding among these contests,

due partially to its purely local con-

uectioil, is that conducted tor the

Faculty Committee Reports

Owing to the agitation conducted
here with regard to the work or the
local Employment Bureau, an investi-
gation was made by a special commit-
,tee appointed by the taculty. The rev
port of this committee, as accepted
by thc faculty, is published herewith:

The wcik or the Employment Bur

reau is devoted to the task of (1) se-
curing jobs for resident and pros-
pective students and i2) attempting
to select those students among the op-
pllcants most worthy or the positions
available.
t Jobs Ai iluhlh. Broadly speaking
there are two classes or jobs open to
students: (1) College jobs, those jobs
about the College that carry as their,
enumeration, room and board in full
‘or in part; (2) jobs down town. There
are some odd jobs that may be down
town or about the College.

Recommendations. The committee‘
is or the opinion that much or thcl
criticism or the Employment Bureau
current at the present time is due (I)
to the scar-city or jobs, which causes
a bitterness of reeling among unsuc-
cessful candidates and (2) to the tact‘,
that preparation or the list for jobs
and the appointing to this list is cellt— !
cred too much in the hands or one in-;

’Llh'itllllﬂ. This power seems unwise at

this time when athletes in general‘.
and the situation at Gl'innell in pore}
ticular is under-going severe and in
some cases deserved criticism. Tidal
