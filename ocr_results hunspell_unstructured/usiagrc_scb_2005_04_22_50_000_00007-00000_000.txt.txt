Having performed for met so years, Holly Near
understands the power of music. Whether singing
{or peace or equal rights, slre artfully includes a po-
litical message in most of her songs, and in doing so,
attempts to inspire social consciousness in her audir
ences,

“Music is a wonderful way to alter conscience,”
Near wrote in an email "Whether lying under a piano
and listening to a friend practice, being at a rally and
hearing a great labor song, or dancing into the night
to persistent drums,we are changed

“I honor rhe power or music,
and I like to work with it within
the context of social change," she
continued, “I would have bored
rnyselrto tears itl had sung'l can’t
live Without you, baby' songs these
last 30 years."

While traveling the Pacrfrc
doing anti-Vietnam War work in
1971, she saw war‘s negative efr
feets on women. Inﬂuenced by her
experiences abroad, she later joined
the growing women’s movement
in [ilC United States and identiﬁed as a feminist

Whether singing for the United Farm Work s in
central California or for peace in El Salindoi, she sees
feminism and activism as a way otlitc. Currently, she
vehemently opposes the war in Iraq.

“I don't want to be part oi‘a country that is hated
arorrnd the world," Near said. “our foreign policy is
crude and destructive. While we attack other-s, our
own nation is tailing apart

“National security isntjnst about how many guns
we have. It rs more about whether we have a vibrant
democratic system. We are tailing in education, in
health, in environmental protection, in the arts, and
in science." .

Near has been honored by the American Civil

As one oftlre first openly leshian performers, Near
often persuaded large crowds to sing, “We are gay and
straight together, singing for our lives." Overseas, leer
bidris in the military used Nears name as a code word
to identify each other‘s sexual orientation. Although
she is in a relationship with a man now, she continues

that there are responsible, loving, partici rting gay
citizens in our Country, and if we are a demoenrey, it
