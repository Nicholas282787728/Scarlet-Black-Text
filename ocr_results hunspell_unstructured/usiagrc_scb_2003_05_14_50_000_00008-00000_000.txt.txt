The ooshy-
gooshy

I‘d like to quote my mother on her thoughts about
suicide suicide is a rcsul t lof mental illness, not an exis.
tential choice To expound upon this point

When they were trying to get into Jonathans room,
and it had become obvious that this wasnt just FM fusing
the storm windows, I went to the peace grove by Fine Arts.
1 lust couldn't sit there and wateh what was going on. Sol
wassitring in the peace grove, which, appropriately enough,
is very peaceful. l looked around, h was such a gorgeous
day. And l wondered why shitty things happen on such
beautiful days 1 got irp to leave after only sitting for a few
minutes As I left, I could smell the trees in the peace grove.
They were in full bloom and smelled so amazing

1 wanted to
pour that feeling
mm svetyonc’s
mind. i wanted to
share how abso.
lutely ooshy-
gooshy I felt. l
havewanted to die
before. in times
like that, you can't smell those flowers; you can't feel ooshye
gooshy. l spend a lot of time wondering howl can package
that feelingand give iraway lspendalot oftimerrying to
hold onto it myself. hurwhen it comes to suicide, it is not
about feeling ooshy.gooshy.

lfsomeone dies of a suicide, ive shouldn't sit around
wondering ifwe could have been nicer, no more than wone
doting ifbeing nicer worrld have cured your uncle‘s cancer
or you grandma's Alzheimer's. Mental illness is just that:
an illness When someone is sick and untreated. there are
consequences lfl get a cut that becomes infected, l should
clean the wound and take some antibiotics before l have to
have my arm amputated. Bur ifl have to have my arm
amputated, it isn't because I was sick ofmy arm and felt it
was time to become a uni.dextet Amy, lenko, Jonathan.
and anyone else who has ever committed suicide wasn't
making a choice.

l miss them terribly, even though I didn't know them.
i love my friends so much. l love my family so much. 1
love living so much. And l am so happy to finally love
living, Even the shittiest day is worth living. Even if all i
can do is sit in Cleveland and smoke a pack ofcigarettes.
Even in never get anotherA, even ifl have to feel pain, at
least I’m feeling, i know what it feels like to never feel any.
thing. I was totally numb when l was using drugs habilue
ally, i couldn't feel, I couldn't care. and l think that was a
lot like being dead. Being numb is not blissful. Not in
comparison with the Technicolor ofrnir living, one care
ing, mt: feeling.

lhnve said that I want to go home before someone else
dics, 1 want to feel safe again. I want everyone else to feel
safe too. Please talk to someone, anyone, if you need to.
Go to the mental health center, Get your infected finger
treated before they have to rake away your arm, 1 wairt to
share the ooshyegooshy with you.

Moral models

When i was in college, my mother, a pmfmor ofpsy.
chology, was looking for a new area of reeatch. We were
talking, and she said something like “I was thinking of
studying the professor as moral model." My reply went
something like “Mom, I know that you serve as a moral
model to your students. However, i think you're the ex.
ception. few faculty serve as moral models. " At Grinnell,
particularly in this time ofcrisis, I need to retract that state.
ment. I’m very proud of my colleagues right now, and I
think we're modeling very moral behavior. 1 hope you've
learned (and continue to learn) the following (and mom)
from ~

-h is important to treat each other as people.

. People are more important than clgsswork,

- it's okay to admit failings.

- lt's okay to ask for help,

- Say “thank you,"

. support each other.

I know what it feels like
to never feel anything. I
was totally numb.

Responding to an emergency situation

If someone is threatening to commit icicle, if someone has let you
know they are close to acting on a smcidal impulse or if you strongly
believe someone you know is close to a suicidal act, those steps can
help you manage the crisis,

- Take the person seriously. Stay calm. but don't under-react.

. involve other people. Don't try to handle the crisis alone or
jeopardize your own health or safety, call 911, it necessary. contact
the person's doctor, the police, a ciisis intervention team or others
who are trained to help.

- Listen attentively. Maintain eye contact. Use body language such as
moving close to the person or holding his or her hand, if appropriate
- Ask direct questions. find out it the person has a speonc plan for
suicide. Determine, if you can, what method of suicide is being
considered. .

- Acknowledge the person's feelings, Be understanding, not
judgmental or argumentative.

- offer reassurance. Stress that suicide is a permanent solution to a
temporary problem, reminding the person that there is help and things
vin'll get better.

- Dun't promise conﬁdentiality. Vou may need to speak to
professionals in order to protect the person from him- or herself.

- If possible, don't leave the person alone until you are sure they are
in the hands of competent professionals. if you have to leave, make
sure someone else can stay with the person untilthey can receive
help.

Emotions and
rationality

i do not like to talk about my feelings in a publicfarllm.1ilook me
more than three hours friday night to be able to talk at the open forum.
burl am glad I did it. i received visits, emails and hugs from people whom
I barely know and even people whom l had never met before. And that
makes me think that whatl said made sense to you all. I will not repeat the
advice, but I will say some more, because you have given me the strength
to do so.

it is very difficult for me to say all of this, so please pardon the iame
bling. What I want to say could easily run into an entire book instead, I
will share with you random. relatively :35y»ro»xharc snippets:

- Write to your faculryand thank them. Understand that they, too, are
human, if they didn't discuss Lenko's death, it's not necessarily because
they didn’t care, but because diey didn't know any better. The last year has
had a lot ofrragedics, like the war in liege which affected a lot of people,
especially those whose family and friends were in the line of fire. out
professors could not possibly be :xpectcd to read our minds and undere
stand our priorities. Nor could they be expeetcd to cancel class every time
something happenede the show must go on, and it is their rob to make
full useofthe few alas hours that
are available to them. Many pre.
sumed that ifwe were in class, we
were there to learn, and so they
taught. Many did not know how
to broach the topic, Many didn't
see why. Many must have felt that
discussing Lenko would make us
think once again about an moi.
dent which wc had forgotten
about. What I am sure of is that
no member of the Grinnell col
lege community would have turned away a student who personally to
guested an extension because of lenko's dmth. All we had to do was ask.

- lam capable ofdealing with crises, andl pride myselfon my ability
to separate myself from my emotions when I know that I need to. l am a
very emotional person, yet the open forum was the first time Friday thatl
shed a teen i talked to the police, menial hqu-i, the chaplains, student
affairs, etc. while they were still waiting for the coroner. l visited the Eco-
nomics SEPC picnic for a few minutes because I knew that i needed
nourishment because ofwhat lay ahead, My first move upon entering my
room was to print a poster with emergency contact information. Trust
me, I am capable ofsepaiating myself from my emotions. This does not
mean that i dont need you Grinnell is a wonderful place to be, andl
appreciate all the love being showered upon me. I even feel guilty some.
times. because I seem to be the center ofattentione which i know I am
not, but the warmth all ofyou are exuding makes me feel as if no one
could be more loved than 1 am right now.

- Many of you are wondering why l am impacted this much by
Jonathan's death. I'll make this one brief. I was his SA. I was on Quizbowl
with him. lwent on a six-hour drive with him to st. Louis. I shared a hotel
room with him, i spent hours widi him and a group ofothers in what was
supposedly a gay bar, I lived two doors away from him. He used to stop by

The warmth all of you
are exuding makes me
feel as if no one could
be more loved than 1am
right now.

How to help someone who is suicidal

- Don't act shocked. This will put
distance between you.

- Be prepared for anger.

- Don't be sworn to secrecy.

- Take action. Remove means.
such as guns or stockpiled pills.
- not help from persons or
agencies specializing in crisis
intervention and suicide
pleventiun. oh campus, contact
an SA, on RLC, Student Affairs
or the Health Center.

- Take care of yourself.

- Be direct. lalk openly and
matterof—factly about suicide.

- Be willing to listen. Allow the
person to express his or her
feelings and be accepting of
those feelings.

- Be non -iudgmental, Don't debate
whether suicide is right or wrong
or feelings are good or bad. Don't
lecture on the value of life,

- Express empathy and concern.
~ Stress that the person's life is
important to you and to others.

and stay to chat. Sometimes, not often. He emptied my can—can, and
shared the profit. He died. He died ofhis own free will, perhaps because
he felt unloved, unwanted, or unneeded. He went through what l can
only imagine to be the most excruciating pain possible. because his life
hurt him even more, He killed himself Jonathan, a man whom i consid-
ered incapable ofkilling a fly (and I joked with him about this), took his
own life, ofhisown free will, while hewas in sound mental health Jonathan

everyone was asleep, was carried out ofthar same hallway by policemen

in heaven the love which he did not see in us during his time on earth.
Rest in peace, Jonathan Raxrer. You will not be forgotten easily.

Preventative

measures

i think depression is everywhere, and I would be surprised ifit were
significantly higher at Grinneu. There are certain aspects ofCrrinncll, such
as the heavy workload and with the lack of off campus entertainment.
that make things difficult for students, However, I think the faculty and
staff work very hard to counterbalance by being very eager to help Slut
dents in academic dilfieuloy and by encouraging large number of active
student activities and organizations.

That being said, I think that there are many students who engage in
selfdesrructive activities, such as drug abuse, which both reduce the like.
lihood of them getting help and exacerbate the symptoms. l amsiclnally
hear some students suggest that so many students are messed up, but i
think this is not representative of die campus as a whole, but of a certain
relatively small portion ofstudents. who somehow feel that abusing drugs
(tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs) is somehow a healthy and acceptable
means of coping with stres, i am not speaking ofsrudenrs who might
have a few drinks on weekends, but instead about students who feel the
need to get drunk or high every night. Studenn who do this likely have
friends who do this, and thus may feel this behavior is representative of
the student body as a whole.

lfl were a highet.up in student chairs, 1 would take a number of
measures. First ofall, lwould make all ofthe residence halls nonsmoking
and have this strictly enforced. This would dmnadmlly cut down on the
cigarette and pot smoking, An additional beneﬁt ofsmokecfree dorms
would be that students who come in with pot and tobacco habits would
not ﬁnd themselves surrounded and encouraged by similar behavior, but
instead would live with a wriety ofstudeno, many ofwhom deal with
stress in much more constructive ways

I would also more closely monitor student alcohol use on campus,
and work to prevent binge drinking. l would make sure there are educa.
tion programs for studenu everyyearabout the dangers ofthcse drugs and
how they detract from students academic work and their life in general.

While I do not think it is possible to completely eliminate deprese
sion from the campus. I think these measures would put students in a
better position ro deal with it and providea more conducive enVlron»
ment for studenu to learn and grow as people.
