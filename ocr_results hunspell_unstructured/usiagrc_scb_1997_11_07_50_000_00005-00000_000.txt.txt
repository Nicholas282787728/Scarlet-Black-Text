#——#—to the Editor

Dear Editor:

In last weeks issue of the 5&3, an
editorial was written in response to
the Take Back the Night March.
Charles Warpehoski stated that he
felt sidelined at the march and felt
that men should “stand in solidarity
with women" This issue surfaces
every year and needs to be addressed
so that the campus community will
understand the reasoning behind the
“women‘s only" space of the march.

One or the purposes of the Take
Back the Night march is to provide
a safe, supportive space for women
who have been victims of gender
based violence or who are concerned
about the issues. The presence of
men in such a space would compro-
mise the protective environment of
the march and ofthe speakout after—
wards that allows women to heal. Mr.
Warpehoski argues that the exclusion
of men from the march maginalizes
male allies and that this prevents him
and other men from being pan ofthe
solution to the problem. To quote:
“I was allowed to sit in a room and
talk while the work was being done
outside."

These ideas are a misinterpretation
ofthe role of men in this night. The
goal of the men's discussion group
is that work will take place there as
much as it does in the march for
women, We feel that Mr. Warpehoski
sees the march as the only effective
means of ﬁghting gender based vio-
lence. However, there are many
ways that men can be part ofthe so-
lution without compromising the
space that is essential to women and
their healing. The men's discussion
group SHOULD have been one of
these ways to be part ofthe solution.

The issue is not that men are N01"
ALLOWED to help as Mr.
Warpehoski suggests, but that men's
support and help is needed in differ-
ent ways. When this is realized, then

, true work can be done.

Sincerely.

Dear Editor,

1 recently learned ofthe resignation
of Pamela Ferguson as President or
this ﬁne school, My guess is that
this causes mixed emotions among
many. President Ferguson, though
a noted administrator and keen pro-
fessor, was in many people's minds
unsuited for the Presidency of
Grinnell College. She always
seemed quite distant from the student
body, and intent on remaking
Grinncll College in the image of
those shiny, squeaky-clean institu—
tions to our nnnh and east. Person-
ally. I hope that this never happens
(perhaps Charlie Duke should be
more than a “temporary" replace»
merit). Being a banker. I am as con»
scious of money and image as any
one, but when I think ofGrinnell, I'd
rather have Walt Whitman. loggia
patties and the bad carpeting on Read
2nd come to mind before Warren
Buffett, social normalcy and the
Grinniell that “might-have-been“ if
Pam Ferguson‘s polishing efforts ran
their full course. For several decades
Grinnell has been rough around the
edges while still being an intensely
gratifying place to learn. I hope no
one alters that anytime soon If they
only replaced the carpet every time
they raised tuition...

Sincerely,
Bill Hoeman '92
