Matt Golden

My experience as a Jomt Board
1J8) representative and member
or Finance Committee and Com»
mittee on Student Politics (CSP)
has led me to believe that
credibility is SGA's foremost pro-
blem. In an etiort to alleviate this
problem i propose the following:
i) The responsibility ior the for»
mation and expression of student
opinion on curricular matters
should be transierred irom JB toa
body composed oi the SGA Presi
dent, the VicerPresident. a is
representative. and the Cur-
riculum Council lEPc chairper»

sons), 2) SGA must strive for a
we king relationship with the ad-
ministration based on cooperation
and mutual respect. Confronta-
tions should be limited to salient
issues such as divestment, the
current moratorium on iacuity
hiring, and core curriculum. 3)
SGA must utilize the CSP to en,
sure that proposals brought
before JB reflect informed posi-
tions. 4) The SGA agenda should
be published in the Campus
Memo. 5) A booklet explaining
SGA's functions should be
distributed to students. This

booklet would educate students
and facilitate greater accessihlity
to SGA services.

SGA must concern itself with
national and international
politics. If students are to affect
national policy, our pluralistic
political system requires that
students present a consolidated
opinion on crucial issues concern-
ing them.

In order to be an effective
legislative body SGA must make
informed decisions utilizing the
maximumrquantity at student ins
put. 7 Matthew Golden

platiorm on the idea that we can
make the administration more
respectiul oi student needs. I was

pleased to see that Matt Golden
shares many of my concerns. I
have recently discovered,
however, that if you mess with the
administrators, they'll come
down on you hard. Whoa-boy!

It is very important ior the Stur
dent Government Association to
be eiiicient. During both the iirst
semester, when I sat on Joint
Board Without a title; and the se-
cond semester, when 1 served as
dorm President oi vounkers. I
have continually tried, with great
success, to modernize the
organization. Student apathy has,
I believe. been lessened since the
Committee on student Politics

was created, both because the
issue of politics has been raised
and because the speed and clarity
with which the issues have been
brought before the SGA has in-
creased.

i have never missed a meeting.

speed, i am capable, experienced
and I know who can be of the most
benefit in the individual chairs. It
is my belief that, rather than deal-
ing with separate issues in this ar-
ticle, it was better to show how the
SGA has been benefitted: A strong
organization. filled with lots of
good ideas. I don't just say lwill
take action: I have taken it. 7

The role oi student government
here at Grinnell should be to pro-
vide student services It should
actively solicit student opinion.
and identify student needs; only
then can it begin to have any real
effect. What is the point of writing
letters to Congress when students
are paying outrageous prices for
shuttle tickets?

The SGA. like the general stu
dent body. is a diverse group oi
people, How can it claim to repre-
sent all SGA members. let alone
the whole student body? I would

like to put SGA on the path oi en-
couraging student debate and
education That is, let’s allocate
student iunds in order to iurnish
the campus with qualitied
speakers or a lilm series about
political issues. it SGA is to be
responsive to students' needs.
then SGA must provide the ins
itiative and opportunity ior
students to educate themselves
about a particular issue

The future role or SGA requires
not only effective leadership and
established credibility. but also

generous amounts of flexibility
and understanding. it requires a
person who is strong enough to
bend without breaking If SGA is
to become the credible organizar
tion that it purports itseli to be. it
must give students the chance to
educate themselves about
political issues in general. and
about the functions of SGA in par
ticular. SGA is a needed student
service! Let's redirect its focus!
Let's make it responsive to stu-
dent needs again’ — Todd Cnulter

 

Raffael Stein

One major problem iaces SGA
today: a general inability to ad-
quately deal with real studentcon
cerns. The halving of our ACr
tivities Counselor’s salary, the
security force problem, and the
present inactivity on the core cur-
riculum issue are good examples.

These and unforeseeable future
matters necessitate an effective
organization. We can build one by
Lil assuring student input leg.

CienLly. This will yield clearer
positions with which to work visa-
vis the administration. Organiza-
tional strength generates student
power.

I can move SGA in this direc-
tion. Two semesters as a JB.
representative and my present
position as P.A.S.F. chair give me.

an inadepth knowledge oi the SGA
bureaucracy and a realistic
perspective as to what is possible.

Regarding political activity. we
must vigorously pursue issues
which directly aiiect students. yet
we must subordinate matters oi a
secondary concern to more one
mediate issues: admission
policies. curriculum reiorm. and
student services. 7 iiaiiael Stein

SGA should become more
representative oi the students.
Uniortunately, most hall
presidents have tailed to report to
their dorms regularly to let
students know what they voted for
in Joint Board and why, and also
to elicit student opinion on issues.
The vice-president should enforce
this provision and I definitely will
do so, because if hall presidents
really represent their constituenr
cics, SGA will be a more credible
body, both to the students and the
administration,

We should re-‘ stitute the shut-
tles, to provide less expensive ser»
vice and jobs for students.

The bookstore should buy back
used books at a specified percen»
tage and resell them at a slight
protit. Many complain about
Bookstore prices; nothing has
been done. We should find the
facts and make a change.

We should organize open iorums
to give students the opportunity to
voice their opinions to each omer
and the administration.

We need a new committee to

The main objective oi SGA is to
address the needs oi the student
body. The only way that SGA can
accurately address these needs is
through adequate representation
