Realﬂions to the Talk

Thakkar said yesterday that Mon-
day night was a beginning for open
discussion of racial issues. “It was
not an ideal format, simply because
ofthe numberofpeople who wished
to speak," he said.

Chon furthered this sentiment,
saying, “A lot of people are trying to
see proactive measures come out of
this [talk].“

She added. however. that such
measures were needed in View ofthe
similarity ofthe past month‘s events
to acontroversy oftwo years ago. in
which minority students protested a
series of actions by fellow students
as insensitive

Moran said, "I would have liked
to have seen more people there."
However, his general feelings fol-

Today's panel discussion at 4:15

Briker, who co-authored several hu-
morous short stories with Anatoly

dialogue. He said, “thlngs became
more personal because ofthis meetr
ing.”

There were some who questioned
how ‘open‘ the talk really was. Dave
Rude] ‘99 said, “It seemed to me that
there were a lot of people who sup
ported Dan and Marcus but were si-
lent for fear of
being called rac-
ist themselves."
At the talk he ex»
pressed his View
that Buettner and
Moran were not
racist tn their ac-
tlons.

Controversy
Beyond the Talk

On Saturday,
November 2nd.
Buettner issued an e-mail message
to SGA and sixteen of his peers,
questioning the validity ofThakkar’s
moderation of the talk. After
Monday's talk Buettner said, "I felt
having the SGA President moderate
the discussion after the cabinet
openly took a position on the issue

was inappropriate. but Mr. Thakkar
was fair."

Thakkar indicated that 39 mes-
sages were received by SGA "that
were for and against [Thakkar] be
ing the moderator." Thakkar re-
sponded to the messages early Mon-
day stating, “It would be inappropri-

“0bviously we want to talk to
ASIA and examine the legal
issues concerning this case
before making any ﬁnal

decisions. ”

dent be the moderator. for our stu»

Thakkar also said that he wcnt
forward with his decision to moder-
ate after soliciting the advice ofVice
President of Human Resources Frank

over this particular issue

SPARC

Speculation that ASIA will ap
preach the Student Publications and
Radio Committee (SPARC) ln seek-
ing the resignations of Bucttncr and
Moran has led SPARC to issue a
statement regarding the controversy.
At this time, the Committee has no
plans to ask Beuttner and Moran to
resign,

Said SPARC Chaiperson Dan
Morgan -97. "Obviously we witnt
to talk to ASIA and examine the ler
gal issues concerning this case be-
fore lnnklng any final decisions.
Therefore,SPARC‘soff'lclalposltion
is that we are examining the issue
very carefully and waiting for ASIA
to approach us With a complaint "
There will also be a meeting between
Morgan, Mr. Crady and Mr. Thomas
next Tuesday in which legal issues
involved with this case will be dis-
cussed.

 

as, "My gosh you’re young to be
doing this,” said Lake.

Lake expressed that his youth pro
vided the campaign with afresh per
spective seldom found in politics, “I
felt thatI was bringing a new voice
to politics in the area, I'm not an es
tablished name in Poweshiek county
politics. My youth added to the en»
ergy of the campaign," he said,

US. SenatorTom Harkin defeated
Republican-challenger Jim Ross
Lightfoot to return to Washington for
his third term. Harkin‘s victory was
aided by a margin ofover 500 votes

ing resolutions of their civtl rights.

Other speakers on the panel ins
cluded Professor of Gender and
Women's Studies Sylvia Thorson-
Smith, Rabbi Jennifer Flatte, and
Professor of Religious Studies Den-
nis Haas, a clergy member of the
United Church of Christ.

Ms. ThorsonASmith helped pro-
duce a report for the Presbyterian
Church that caused a considerable
amount of controversy The report
dealt with sexual ethics, and looked
at, among other things, “the sub
stance of relationships rather than the
form,"’ according to Ms. Thorson
Smith.

Jennifer Flatte, an ordained rabbi
in the Reformed Jewish Community,
said, “The Biblical notion I take most
to heart is the image of God and the
idea we are all created male or fe-

Voter turnout across the state of
Iowa was nearly 80 percent, accord-
ing to National Public Radio, but
Poweshiek county turnout was down
10 percent from 1992.

HouseThe first precinct, which cons
tains Grinnell College, voted by a
two to one margin for Bill Clinton.

ASIA Controversy, continued from page 1

Uncertainty has surrounded the
interpretation of SPARC‘S by-laws,
which were written in the late ‘80‘s.
Under the existing by-laws in the
SPARC constitution, the SGA Presi-
dent has the power to veto the deci-
sions of SPARC. Neither Morgan
not Thakkar will address this issue
until SPARC has actually been ap-
proached by ASIA. however.

According to Chon. ASIA has yet
to meet regarding its next steps in
pursuing the resignations ofBuettner
and Moran.

Election, continued from page 1

after state’s Electoral votes accumu-
late for the President. Students report
to be excited for the Clintons, and
look forward to having a president
who will not be campaigning for his
own revelecticn while he rounds out
his tenure.

“I think that. during his second
term in office, Clinton will be able
to be a more effective policymaker
because he will not be worried about
appealing to every imaginable vot-
ing and ﬁnancing group for the next
election. Also. Chelsea has bloSv
somed," said Jeff Root ‘97.

Faith and Sexuality, continued from page 1

male in the image of God. Because
of this, there is a spark ofthe divine
in each person.“ Rabbi Flatte feels
that many different kinds of people
are needed to make up the world.
including people of varying sexual
orientations. “To embrace as much
of this (difference) as possible can
only he good," she said.

Mr. Haas presented a Biblical are
gument based on the idea that homer
sexuality is not a prominent theme
in the Bible, He urged people who
would use the Bible as a basis on
which to refute homosexuality to “be
consistent." Mr. Haas stated that if
one Biblical law is to be taken as
truth, than all other Biblical laws
must be treated with equal weight
and importance.

Three Grinnell students, Jeremy
Youde ‘99, Steve Watkins ‘98 and

Anna Ryon ‘97, were also members
of the panel. Both Youde and
Watkins spoke on the contradictions
between the smaller. local division
ofthe individual congregation within
the Church, and the national Church
itself.

Watkins, a Catholic, said, “I don’t
think the world-wide Church will
ever accept [homosexuality]. It will
only happen on asmall, local level."
Ryon, a Methodist whose father is a
minister, also discussed the frustra-
tion found in the contradictions of the
Church. Despite these contradic-
tions. however, Ryon continues to
seek and, on many levels, receive
support from her church. “When I
struggle and when I try to fight for
change is when I ﬁnd the most sup»
port,” she said.
