/Delitists drill 3&3

It is almost axiomatic among Grin-
nellians these days that things have
changed, that Grinnell and its students
are no longer what they used to be. All
over campus one hears talk that Grin-
nell students are more conservative,
more career-oriented, and less activist
than their ’60: counterparts, meaning
either that we are being overrun by
geeks, nerds, preppies, and
Republicans, or that a refreshing
whiff of real world atmosphere has
ﬁnally penetrated the ivory tower.

l, oi course, tend toward the latter
view, and in observing two or the
more noteworthy highlights oi this
semester, the publication of the Bits
and the debut of the Dentists, it is
clear that Grinnell has changed, and
for the better. The 8518 bills itself as
”the other Grinnell College,” but the
Dentists are the real Grinnell College.

in many ways, the 8&3 is the last
remnant of the shameful days when
Grinnell's name was reviled
throughout the Midwest as a place oi
moral laxity and rebellion against
timerhonored American traditions and
values. Then, as the 8&8 would have

.it now, Grinnell students engaged in
indiscriminate sex, partook oi
numberless varieties oi drugs, and
generally scorned by word and deed
common standards of decency and
coniormity,

Today, in its pathetic. plaintive,
anonymous fashion, the Bets urges a
return to irresponsible anarchy, the
unchecked sway oi sensual desires,
and the jealous indictment of those of
us who want to make something oi
ourselves. But the B&Sers failed to
realize, drug-crazed and sclfrcentered
as they are, that most Grinnell
students are lar too responsible and
respectable to heed the voice of anar-
chy crying in the wilderness.

Many people thought Gerald Ford
had a tendency to say dumb things.
But it we don't watch our steps, we
may iind ourselvcs with a president
who appears incapable oi reasoning
out loud. When asked why he wanted
to be president, one candidate gave
this reply:

“The reasons i would run are
because I have great beliei in this
country, that is—there's more natural
resources than any nation oi the
world, there's the greatest educated
population in thc \vol'ld.. and the
greatest political system in the world;
it just seems to me that this nation
can cope and deal with the problem in

Consequently, a fierce torrent oi
abuse has cascaded down upon the
B&S from all sides, an outpouring oi
righteous wrath that has shown the
sex-and-drugs ianatics that no one
wants to listen to their mindless prai-
tle anymore. So taken aback were the
Bdis types, they were iorced to retreat
in the face Of Hatchetman Dan
Flynn’s scathing attacks and admit
the truth of some of his criticrsms.

A typical Grinnell student—he at
tended a Catholic military school and
would never dream of indulging in
premarital sex, doing drugs, or ques~
tloning authorityiFlynn represents a
broad spectrum of campus opinion
and his denunciation leaves no doubt
that nobody likes the 3&5. But this
issue also leaves no doubt that Flynn
and everyone else loves the Dentists.

This talented band of aspiring young
musicians is far more in tune With the
attitudes and ieelings oi the campus
today than that licentious rag could
ever be, and its wholesome brand oi
family entertainment is an infinitely
more mature and constructive form of
selfrexpression.

Instead of a juvenile preoccupation
with sex and drugs, the Dentists sing
about the profound realities of contem-
porary liie, things that really matter
for most Grinnell students. Many of
us, indeed, share the worthy ambition
to become a Rock and Roll Lawyer
and are inspired by the Dentisls’ cat
chy lyrics to study our LSATs all the
harder

Moreover, what could better repre~
sent the Grinnell coed than that
iaudatory paean to contemporary
liberated womanhood, Airhead? And
what more tender expression of
honorable realtionships between the
sexes could be found than in Birth
Controli‘she's a slab of meat/Can't

you see that spread."

Unlike the Hits, the Dentiss possess
dedicated hard core oi fans and sup-
porters who attend their every note
with rapt attention, You won't see 11
people being trampled to death at the
Dentists concert—the audience, like
the performers, are orderly and well
behaved (and totally straight). I was
once iortunate enough to be introduc-
ed to Dave Rude, lead vocalist of the
Dentists, and I was immediately
struck by the way in which he per-
sonlfied, as no willso’rtherwisp BSzSer
ever could, the true spirit of Grinnell
College. A modest, restrained, quiet,
but charming iella, Dave is exactly
the same in person as he is on stage.
There is no sham or pretense about
him; he simply wants to do well in
school, become a lawyer, raise a fami-
ly, and make $50,000 a year through
tax evasion. And isn’t that what the
Grinnell Experience is all about?

Despite the 8315, we are hardly on
the verge oi returning to the '60s.
Grinnell and Grinnell students have
changed, and that is why the Dentists
are loved, while the BRLS is hated.
when pushkin comes to shove. we‘d
all rather be like Dave Rude and Dan
Flynn than the burntsout derelicts of
the lists, wouldn't we?

The same candidate, when asked
what was his campaign strategy,
replied, “Well,’we're, uh, we've a ilow

minimum you, uh, have to do and then
do theia little more,"

This Candidate was asked if he
thought his version or the Chappaquidr

cepted as trutliiul. He gave this

revealing answer:
“Oh there'sithe problemifrom

The candidate is, oi course, Senator
