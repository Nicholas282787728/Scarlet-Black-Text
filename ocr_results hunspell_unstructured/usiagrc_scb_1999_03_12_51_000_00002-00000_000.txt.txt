Earhart have had on our socrety and
culture Many of the 1999 poster
women who have beneficially af-
fected America are notaswcll known
as Earhart. Susan B. Anthony, or
Rachel Carson, but their impact has
been decisive.

When .she began taking pictures,

“Peter and Polly," reﬂecting peculiar
talent at such a young age,
