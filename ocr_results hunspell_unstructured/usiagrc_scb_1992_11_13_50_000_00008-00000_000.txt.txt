by Todd Young

The football team ended its sea
son with a 60-13 loss at Illinois Col-
lege last Saturday, finishing the sea
son without a win.

in the finale the Pioneers were ‘

overpowered by the Illinois College
offensive line which enabled the
Blueboys to accumulate 568 yards
on the ground.

Todd McGuire hit Joe McCarthy on
a nincryard pass. McCarthy had four

The final Pioneer score came on an-
otherpass from McGuire, this time a
247de scoring strike to Nigel Lawes.

CoachGregWallaeewaspleased
with the effortthe Pioneers displayed
this year. With only 31 players fin-
ishing the season, Wallace said that
many players were forced to play out
of position or on both offense and
defense, but everyone did it in order
to compete as well as possible on
Saturday.

Wallace also said, “For the fu»

titre we have to dramatically increase
our numbers, and theplayers we bring
in ntustbe good football players. We

have eight young men who never
even played high school football, and
you can not win in our conference
with that kind of situation."

Darby Gym turns 50, alumni game
tomorrow for Men and Women

by Ml". Jim George

Thehallowed hallsofDarbyGym
are being prepared fora 5011i anniver-
sary celebration this Saturday. The
1992 Pioneer men‘s and women’s
basketball teams will provide the em
tertatnment as they take on alumni
squads. The women’s game tips off
at 1:00 with an anniversary ceremony
immediately following. Themen play
at 3:30.

Banners will be hung in honor of
the 196162 men's Midwest Confer-
ence championship team and the ‘78-
79 and ’90-91 women‘s leaguechamr
pionshlp teams.

IfDarby Gymnasium could talk,
she would spin a string of inleresting
tales. in her 50 years the venerable
budding has accumulated a vastarray
of memories — the thrills of victory
and the disappointments of defeat in
hundreds of basketball games and
other sporting events. And the fun,
joy and pride generated by countless
concerts, dances and commence-
merits.

This unique structure, dedicated
in 1942, is named for Fred Darby, an
1895 Grinnell graduate and wealthy
Oklahoma oilman who personally

provided a large part of the building
funds. The benefactor, described asa
Pioneer “all-time athletic great,"
played football and baseball, and later
served as a college trustee.

Construction of Darby just be-
fore and during World War II is an
engaging story, In October 1941 the
trustees decided not to wait until de-
fense needs diminished enough for
the government to release steel for
domestic building, but opted to use
wood for the roof instead of steel.
Substitution of wooden beams re-
duccd the cost of the gym from
$140,000 to $125,000.

The original seating capacity of
1,700 has been reduced to 1,250 due
to installation of offices at the south
end, but the eructure remains an ex-
cellent basketball fticrlity.

Memoryrmaking in Darby bee
gan immediately when the Pioneers
ambushed Iowa State, 3730, in the
gym’s inaugural. Ed Bowers, 1947
graduate and later a longtime coach
here, captained thatteain. Ollict'highr
lights include the Midwest Confer
ence championship season of 1961-
62 when the Grinnell men were 18-4
overall.

The advent of intercollegiate
basketball for women brought a new

look to Darby in 1976-77. Pioneer
women have won two titles, the first
viaatournatncntin ’78v7‘). Beforea
roaring crowd in Darby in 1991A”-
American Missy Sliarer’s 42 points
propelled Grinnell to victory in the
title game. Sharer anti Laura
VanSickle '90, Academic All-
American and career scoring leader,
are on the alumni reunion roster.

The cagers are playing on the
original Darby floor. Though the
wood is well worn, the surface is in
good condition and capable of ab—
sorbing a lot more memories.

Current Grinnell coaches are
enthusiastic about the ambience of
Darby, as evidenced by these words:

Women 's basketball coach Tcd
Eskiltlscn:”CoachinginDarbyGym
is truly an honor. Its history and
character make you feel like you are
part of something very special. I
love to be here with the students,
t‘urnliy and friends of the college.
1t’sa greatatinosphcre tocreatc come

Men’s basketball coach Dave
Arseneault: “When I walked into
Darby for the first time. I had dte
same warm feeling 1 got from the
movie, ‘The Hoosiers', Istill feel the
same.”
