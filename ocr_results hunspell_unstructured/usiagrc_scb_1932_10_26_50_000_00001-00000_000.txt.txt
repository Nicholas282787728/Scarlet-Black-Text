National Collegiate Players
to Install Underclass
Subsidiary

A aubsi iary organization to the
Grinnell chapter of National Colleg-
iate Players was announced at a
meeting in the little theatre of the
quadrangle last night by William
Pryor, president. to a group of about
50 freshmen and sophomores interes-
ted in drama.

As explained by Mr. Pryor, this
will not be a separate drama organi-
zation. but it will be composed of
students from the two under classes
who are not eligible, according to
national organization rulings, to
membership in the senior group.

Players to Invite

students who have been in any
play, a class one-act or a public pro-
duction, either as an actor or as a
member of the technical staff are
eligible for membership in the junior
organization, provided their work
has been outstanding. Membership is
by invitation from the National Col-
legiate Players group.

This subsidiary group will have no
constitution or officers. They will
meet with the Players group once a
month for informal talks on the
drama, lectures, or class one-act
plays. The first group of one-act
plays will be given in the little thea-
tre of the quadrangle tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.

To Have Pin

it is planned to have a pin, de—
signed especially for the junior group,
although designs have not been com-
pleted as yet. The pin will not be ex-
pensive.

Present sophomores and others, not
in the Players group, who have prev-
iously been active in drama work,
will be sent invitations first. AS
other students qualify invitations will
be sent them, the Players organiza-
tion plans.

Rosen’sjPaper
Chase Newest
Grinnell Feature

A new feature in cross country
running will be presented to Grinnell:
inns Thursday afternoon by Coach
Elton A. Rosen. A paper chase over
a course approximately three miles
long will be sponsored by the Cross
Country club for freshmen and non-
varsity runners. Ribbons will be
awarded to the winners.

The novelty of the race is that the
runners pursue a course marked by
bits of paper. There will be several
blid leads that will make it neces~
sary for those who follow these leads
to retract their steps and get back
onto the right trail.

The paper chase has oeen a pop-
ular affair in the East and Coach
Roaen hopes that its approval here
may stimulate interest in cross couns
try. The race is one of the four requis-
ites for a freshman numeral.

Star to Join
Players Group-

Cooper Honorary Member
of Grinnell Chapter

HOLLYWOOD, Calif, (CNS)7
Gary Cooper, who three times failed
in tryouts for membership in the
Grinnell college dramatic club, this
week disclosed he had been invited to
become an honorary member of the
society.

The Paramount pictures star, who
was a student at the college in 1922
and 1923, said he had not decided
whether he would accept the invita-
tion.

u1 thought I was an actor then,”
he declared, “but now I'm positive
I'm Delis!) maybe I’m still ineligible
for membership." '

One of the actor’s friends, who
was a Grinnell student at the same
time, told College News Service that
"Gary suffered tortures trying to
get into the dramatic club, but he
just didn’t click!”

Former Student

Not Initiated

When Gary cooper was in Grin-
nell at homecoming three years ago.
the Grinnell chapter of National COL
legiate Players invited him to become
a member of the Grinnell chapter.
and he accepted.

Membership application blanks
were sent to the national organiza~
tion and Mr. Cooper's membership
certificate and key were sent to the
Grinnell chapter. It was hoped that
he could return to he initiated at
Grinnell, but so far the hope has not
been fulfilled.

The University of Southern Cali»
fornia has a chapter of National Col-
legiate Players, and the Grinnell chap-
ter is considering sending the mem-
bership certificate and key to that
chapter with the request that it
initiate Mr. Cooper, William Pryor,
president of the local chapter, ans
uounced.

40-Piece Band
Will Represent

Grinnell college will he represented
by a 40 piece band at the Grinnell-
Drake football game Friday night.
The band will leave for Des Moines
Friday afternoon.

Director Chester Williams stated
that plans for the band concerning
the homecoming festivities are in
preparation.

All women who have not been at-
tending rehearsals of the women's
band are urged to meet for practice

League Board Announces
Two More Regulations

As the result of a meeting of
League Board held on Monday eve-
ning at 10 o‘clock Katherine Hay-
ward, president, today made the fol-
lowing announcements.

No food may be ordered from town
after 10:30 p.m.

A person missing two sign his in
one week may be sent to study hall
for five days.

 

they raise the money indicated in
their budgets as necessary for
school year.
Originally the
ations were religious

the

Christian associs
organizations

Twenty years ago. A. B. DeHaan,
'06, returned from missionary service
in China and presented a plan to the
students and faculty to interest them
in founding a school of high school
rating in Shantung province. China,

and in the Y. W. meetings, regular
Bible study was carried on. in later
years the women wanted something
useful to do, so it became a sewing
circlc mixed with religious discus»
sions. That was soon after its organ-
ization in 1885 or 1390.
Become Prominent

As Grinnell increased in size these
organimtions became more promi-
nent until important work was en—
trusted to them with the assurance
it would be well done. Two of the big»
gest jobs were the General, the for-
mal reception given each fall at the
close of Freshman days, and editing
of the Grinnell college handbook, the
freshman bible.

Of course the organizations each
hold regular meetings, planned with
a definite objective in view. Students,
faculty or promnent town persons lads
dress these meetings. At ,Y. w. meet-
ing there is always music to add to
the spirit of the occasion.

Nelson w. Wehrhan, director of
vocational guidance and faculty ad-
viser for the Pioneer Chest drive, re~
members when he came to Grinnell
that he was met by a member of the
Y. M., who helped him to find a room
where he might work. This work of
the Y. M. has been transferred more
recently to the deans' offices.

Give Social Service

Another project of the organiz-l
tions is Uncle Sam's club, a sociall
service performed for the less for-
tunate children of Grinnell. College‘
folks, who are interested, devote their
Sunday afternoons to work at Uncle
Sam’s and are paid only in satisfac-
tion.

Besides these concrete projects the

 

where there was none. The college
and church were able to collect
enough to found a boy's school in
Techow in Shantung.

Every few years graduates of
Grinnell who are interested in that
kind of work have gone there and
made name sfor themselves and
Grinnell, for it is known as Grinnell-
in-China. Among these are Paul
MacEachron, for whom MacEachron
field is named, Harold Matthews, For-
est Chapman. Don Fessler. Alice
Reed.

The Pioneer Chest dr is then is to
enable these associations to carry on
the work they have started and to
help in giving others good education-
al advantages.

The brilliant running of Joe Pfeifr

Grinnell-Drake Grid Rivalry
Dates Back 31 Years;
Last Win 1926

By MAX ROSS

The Scarlet and Black of Grinnell
college and the blue and white of
Drake university will provide a color
ful background for the traditional
battle between the Pioneers and the
Bulldogs over the old oakcn bucket
when the two teams clash as a fea-
ture of the Drake homecoming Fn»
day night.

It is the game of games for the
Grinnell team. If all other games
during the season are lost except the
Drake encounter, the season is still
a success. Regardless of previous
performances by either team during
any season, this annual struggle is
always close, although it has been
six years since the Pioneers brought
home a victory.

Grinneliiaus on Edge

Captain Grafiund and his cohorts
are on edge already, and they will
leave Grinnell Friday morning with
virtually the whole equad making the
trip. The Pioneers enter the game the
underdogs, but the two teams are
very closely matched.

Followers of the team are puzzled
over the spotty showing of the team
in its last two games, both of them
away from home. They were games
that Grinnell should have won, games
in which the team clearly outplayed
its opponents. The chief trouble each
time was the lack of a scoring threat.
Again and again the Pioneers worked
the ball into scoring position, but
then the attack folded up.

Seek Good Combination

And so at the present time, no one
is overly enthusiastic, and yet no one
harbors a pessimistic outlook. There
is enough potential dynamite in the
Grinnell team to put the Bulldogs
completely to rout if the right com-
bination can be found.

One thing that has made it hard
for Coach Watt this year is the fail-

tr‘ontinued on Page 3).

Bulldogs Say Pioneers

Will Get Battle

DES MOiNES, IOWA, (Special)—
As the stock market went in 1929 so
goes the rating of the Drake Bull-
dogs in the Missouri Valley confer-
ence race last week.

Creighton university took sweet re-
venge and made the homecoming
crowd happy when they sho'ved the
Bulldogs farther down the ladder with
a 12 to a win at Omaha.

Now the Drake Bulldogs for their
homecoming game are preparing an
attack that will make the Pioneers
sit up and take notice when Drake
and Grinnell meet at Des Moines Fri-
day night. Coach Williams Monday
sent his squad through a long work-
out consisting of fundamentals and
signal drill. A light scrimmage with
the varsity on the offense concluded
the day’s drill.

The backfield combinations were
new in last week's game but now
have had the experience of that en—
counter and should show some form
ths Week. Drake has been slow in
getting started, meeting some of
their toughest competition in the
early games of the season and being
at a disadvantage because of the
necessity of learning a new system
under a new coach. However, this
should begin to shape up well by Fri-
day night and the Bulldogs should
make the Pioneers work hard for
every inch of ground they gain.

Drake has not lost a homecoming
game in some years and have not
lost to Grinnell in more than five
although the Pioneers tied the Bulls
dogs 6 to 6 in 1929 when Drake had
one of the best teams in its history.

However, past history doesn't mean
a thing to the future as was well
demonstrated at Creighton last week,
and since anything can happen in a
football game this is no time to pre-
dict the outcome.
