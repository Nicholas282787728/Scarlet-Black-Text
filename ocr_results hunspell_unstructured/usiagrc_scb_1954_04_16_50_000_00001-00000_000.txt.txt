Committee Adopts ’Phased'
Ratification ol: Constitution

The student Constitution Come
mittee Tuesday night decided
by a 6-3 vote to move for ad-
option this year oi those pants
of the constitution which can
be agreed upon now by the
faculty and administration.

The committee was presented
with this method of adoption
at an unofficial meeting with a
member of the administration.
Under this method, as outlined
to the committee, the structure
of the executive council and
possibly the judicial bodies
would go into effect immede
iately.

The Council at House Pres-
idents, in a meeting after the
committee made its decision,
went on record as opposed to
the “phased“ ratification of
the constitution;

Under this method of ratifie
cation the executive council
would probably hold all power
now in the hands oi the present
agencies of student government.
The judicial bodies, ii agreed
upon, would hold all student
judicial functions.

The working organs of the
proposed student government.
the committees on social af-
fairs, budget, student organiza-
tions, and communications
would be left out of the first
move for ratification, but the
chairmen of those committees
would probably be appointed in.
formally, enabling them to
work with the groups present»
ly exercising responsibility in
those fields.

The committees, their struc-
ture and powers, would be
worked out next year in stu-
dent . faculty . administration
negotiations.

Voting to adopt this plan of
ratification were Student Coun-
cil Président Kitten Arveson,
Portia McNally, Lois Grosser,
Dottie Fulton, Kent Halsey and
Dave Ferguson. Ed Laing, Norm
Noe and Barney Gissenaas voted
against the method, stating
their preference for final ap-
proval on all parts oi the pro-
posed constitution before ' any

part is ratified.
