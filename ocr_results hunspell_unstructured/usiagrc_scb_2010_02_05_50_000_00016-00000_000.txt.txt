and save energy this winter by_ turning down
your heat. If your dorm room doesn't hnve a user-
friendly thermostat, check for a small door on your ra-
diator, Some dorms on campus have a small door (about
5x5 inches) with a knob inside that you can turn to adjust
your heat. Don’t have a knob? Contact PM at x3300 and
they can adjust your moms temperature or install a knob
for future use. That way you can stay Wm without warm-

ing the globe!

told ofa mystical 4x4 condiment tray that would
please any persons desires. Instead, what I found
was the Death of the American Dream Walk
into the new Kurn 8c Go and you will forget
that you are in Grinnell, IA you might as well
be in the suburbs of Chicago. Where once stood
a landmnrk as important: as the Jewel Bank, now
stands a lame cookierutrer excuse of a placer
No more onions. no more chili. no more Fusing

There' 15 no excuse for not using i my when re—

you create an even bigger mess for your fellow
