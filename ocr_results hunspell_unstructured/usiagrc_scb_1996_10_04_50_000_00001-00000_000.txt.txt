Police discuss presence on campus

SGA clariﬁes the relationship between the police and Grinnell College in Joint Board meeting

By ERIN CHILDRESS
Reporter

In an attempt to alleviate student cons
cerns about the new bicycle police prose
encc on campus, Grinnell Police Officer
Larry Bush intended the SGA Joint Board
meeting on Wednesday to explain the new
patrol and answer questions.

The purpose ofthe bicycle pntrol, Bush
explained, is to increase safety in the
downtown area, as well as to decrease
officers‘ response time. Ill the past, most
patrolling was either done by car, which
decreased ofﬁcers' acccsibilily, or by foot,
which was time-consuming and made me
sponding to calls nlorc difficult. Follow-
ing the precedent being set across the na-
tion, the Grinnell Police Department drew
up a proposal to add an Officmlly trained
bike patrol unit to the department.

Though many students have
experessed concern that the bike patrol
seems to have increased the police press
ence on campus, Bush explained this is
not so. In the past, ofﬁcers patrolled clim-
pus several times a night on foot, spend-
ing about an hour on campus at a time.
Now, though the ofﬁcers may ride through
campus more, they spend closer to 15
nminutes on campus. Bush also feels that
the nature of the patrol also increases vis-
ibility; high beam headlights and a flash-
ing red light signal their approach and
departure.

Bush is pleased by the majority of re
sponses to the bikes. “In the past, people

wouldn‘t talk to us when we were just
driving around in a car. Now, people seem
to feel I’m more approachable while wearr
ing biker shorts!" explained Bush,

Bush also responded to students’ con
cerns that the presence of bikes signalled
a fundamental change ill the security con
cerns of the police department. “We're
on campus primarily as a security check,“
he explained, The police are not looking
to “bust" college students for illegal ace
trvity. In fact, Bush continued, the OffICr
crs are mainly concerned wtth minors
from Giinncll who might cause a distur-
bance to college students.

However, Bush did identify some of
the ramifications ofa self-governing cola
lege coexisting with a small community.
“The college is not a bubble,” he ex7
plained, “the college is part of the coin-
munity as well.” He communicated the
view that thc police department cxpects
reciprocal behavior. “Of course, if you
shove [a beer] in our face, we’re going to
have to ask for ID . . . Just treat us like
you want to be treated." '

Tom Crady, Dean ofStudents and Vice
President oflhc college, was also present
at the meeting. Crady explained that per
lice have always come through campus
as a form of crime prevention. Accord
ing to Crady, “It would be irresponsible
for us to m let police on campus.” Crady
added that there have been no problems
on campus yet he assaults or liai-rassinent

SDAE petitions bookstore

Activists seek to discontinue products

By LINDSAY HAGY
._.. .u = Staff Writer

Lists of cosmetic manufacturers who
do not test on animals have been appear-
ing in bathrooms across campus. This is
due to preparation for a campaign led by
Students in Defense of Animals and the
Environment (SDAE) to encourage stun
dents to buy cruelty-free products. Thc
campaign will be launched next week.
The organization is hoping to have the
bookstore discontinue selling cruelty free
products, however, as long as students are
buying these products, the College Book—
store cannot do that.

In May of 1995, SDAE succeeded in
convincing the bookstore to remove from
their shelves many products distributed
by Gillette and Procter and Gamble, two
prominent cosmetic and hygiene compa-
nies that admit to nnimzll testing. The

bookstore could not find replacements for
several Procter and Gamble products,
however, among them Clearasil and
Alleve. Instead, these products are ac-
companicd on the shelves by signs which
read “From 1985 through 1993, an esti—
mated 450,000 animals died at the hands
of Procter and Gamble‘s scientists."

SDAE recently presented an updated
list of cruelty-free cosmetic products to
Cassie Wherry, Business Manager of the
College Bookstore, “There is no way we
can comply with that wllile providing the
convenience items that students need,"
Wherry said. “ We would need to elimi-
nate the entire section." As it is, the store
has decreased its sundry item section from
eight feet to four feet.

Because the College Bookstore pure
chases such a small amount of these eve
eryday needs products. they go through a

Downtown construction irks
students living off—campus

Staff Writer

The downtown Grinnell area 15 cur
rently hosting many public and pin‘alc
construction projects, The noise and
ruckus have proved n nuisance for many
downtown residents, including several
college students.

Late this summer, Daniel Roggc ‘97
moved into his apartment on Fourth Ave
enue in downtown Grinnell. On one side
of his apartment, the Grinnell State Bank
is slowly adding an nddition in wind it
calls :1 “Progress Zone," and the City of

Grinnell ripped up the street in front of
his home during the summer in order to
replace sidewalks and put llew wiring into
slrcetlights. "I‘ve been living in hell for
the past seven months," said Roggc.
Many downtown residents and busi-
ness people share Rogge's sentiments.
"There have been a few complaints." Said
City of Grinnell Director of Building and
Planning Dunne Nelf, “Usually the com-
plaints happen when we’re right in front
of [the i'esldcnls’] buildings." Mr. Neff
said he recognized that “in some ways the
construction is hurting business."

Students question privacy
of HIV testing at Grinnell

By MELIND JONES
Staff Writer

Serious concerns are escalating about
the lack of conﬁdential. affordable and
accessible HIV testing in the Grinnell
area, Students are describing current
options as lacking in affordability and
conﬁdentiality. Theyexpresssimilascon-
cems with the methods by which condoms
are distributed on campus.

Condom distribution among students
is currently handled through the Health
Center, where two condoms for each stus
dent are available per day on request. Each
individual student is required to give her
or his name and student ID number be-
fore receiving condoms.

Grinnell students are concerned that
this procedure interferes with both confl-
dentiality and accessibility. Powell Dixon
‘98, an active member of GEAR
(Gt-i nnellians Escalating AIDS Response),
brought up a common student belief that
the two condom per day policy is a way
of“rationing morality,” making condoms
available only to the extent thought ap-
propriate by those in the position to dis-
tribute them. Students also fear that by
requiring a name and Id number, the
Health Center takes the factor of conﬁ-
dentiality from them.

Donna Bailey, Director of Health Ser

vices at Grinnell, counters these concerns.
“The Health Center is not meant to be the
main source of condoms for students, nor
are we here to restrict anyone. We merely
supplement students until they can meet
their own personal needs," she said. She
went on to p'oint out that besides the ser-
vices provided by the Health Center, in-
expensive condoms are available at Bob's
Underground, in campus laundry rooms,
and at the Harris Center.

Regarding the requirement of name and
ID number, Mrs. Bailey states that ale
though the interaction is taken down on
the student‘s record, it is billy for budget»
ary reasons. The information is recorded
under a code and the word “condom” is
never used in the report.

Free HIV testing is not available in
Grinnell at this time. The three closest free,
conﬁdential testing sites are located in Des
Moines, Iowa City and Marshalltown.
Students without cars who are uncomfort—
able asking someone else to drive them to
be tested are left with the alternative of
going to a nearby doctor’s ofﬁce. In do-
ing so, some students feel they are forced
to sacriﬁce their privacy.

Establishing a testing site in Grinnell,
however, does not seem probable: “On a
campus this small, maintaining conﬁden-
tiality would be extraordinarily difﬁcult,"

Marcia F alk lectures on
women’s roles in Judaism

By SARAH PILTCH
Reporter

Dr. Marcia Falk, poet, translator, and
feminist Judaic scholar, recently com-
pletcd n VlSll to campus as Gates Lecturer
for this year. She presented two lectures
to the campus community. On Wednes-
day night, she spoke about her translation
of the biblical Sang ofSangs (also titled
Song of Solomon) In a lecture entitled
“Spirituality and Sensuality in the Voices
ofJewish Women." Her convocation lec—
ture, entitled “The Book ofBlessings: A
Feminist Approach to Jewish Prayer", ex-
plored her recently published feminist
prayer book. In both ofthese speeches she
spoke oi‘nltegrating religious scholarship,
poetry, feminist concerns and women’s
experience.

The Gates lectures have been a part of
Grinnell life since 1913, when funding for
an annual speaker was endowed in the
name of the late President George A.
Gates in order “to bring to the campus the
very best ofmotlcm thought" on religion.
Past Visiting lecturers have included such
names in religious thought as Reinhold
Nicbuhr (Gales Lecturer 1932), Huston
Smith (1970), Mary Daly (1974), Rose
lllary Ruetller (1981), Phyllis Trible
(I986), and within the last two years:
Carter Heyward (1994) and Katie G. Can-
non (1995). In introducing the convoca»
tion lecture Professor Harold Kasimow of

the Religious Studies department, a friend
and scholarly associate of Dr. Falk, noted
that Dr. Falk is the ﬁrst Jewish woman to
be a Gates Lecturer.

In her lecture on “Spirituality and Sen-
suality in the Voices of Jewish Women"
Dr. Falk raised the question: Are women's
voices in Jewish literary and religious tray
dition distinct from those of men? If so,
how have they been influential?

The Hebrew Bible speaks from an al-
most exclusively male voice from a patri-
archal perspective. The most notable ex-
ception to this is the Song ofSangs. In this
book of the Bible women speak over half
of the lines. The love poems which com-
prise the Song of Songs have a lyrical,
song-like nature found nowhere else in the
Bible. Their subject matter speaks to a love
of the earth, the erotic, and sensual enjoy—
ment. The'women speak with their own
voices from authority and with power, not
objectiﬁed, or as a muse to a male voice,

In her translation from original Hebrew
sources which maintain original gender as-
signments, Dr. Falk has refashioned a Song
of Songs in which women’s voices and
desires are heard and predominate. Not
only do we hear gendered voices in the
Song of Songs, we also hear voices from
different classes, and races. The original
text “blissfully nbliterates" hierarchical
sexual roles, and presents relationships of
mutuality. Although the text represents
