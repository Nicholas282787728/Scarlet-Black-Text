states from the Atlantic to the Gulf— including Saudi
Arabia and Egypt — are boycotting the Middle East and
North Africa economic meeting. Qatar, though, pledges

mies.

fore it won the May election. Blair‘s government had
stressed its commitment to higher ethical standards in

Mingus Big Band: the legend lives on

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

A legendary composer, bassist, and
bandleader, he left behind a legacy which
continues to pulse With a dramatic energy
and vigor not seen regularly in the world
of jazz, and music as a whole today,

“It ripped, roared and left those in at-
tendancc anything but flat,” wrote Lloyd
Sachs of the Chicago Sun Times in an
August 1997 article.

Demonstrating “stunning instrumental
counterpoint, outrageous lnnel’rVOICC dis-
sonance and ferocious solo playing," their
music “saved the Chicago Jazz Festival,"
as Howard Reich ofthe Chicago Tribune
wrote, also in August of this year

Although many may not have heard his
name, among those who have been
around, and most certainly individuals
with a knowledge of jazz, the name
Charles Mingus carries with it thoughts
of energetic, vibrant music, with deep-
seated emotional undertones.

Playing this coming Monday, Novem-
ber 17, at 8 pm in Herrick Chapel, the
Mingus Big Band promises to bring to
Grinnell an evening of great music.

two movements from Rachmaninoff's
“All Night Vigil."

Rommcreim describcd “Chanticleei”
as a “spiritual or gospel medley" with live
solo parts. Because it was originally erl-
ten for all men, the piece had [0 be adapted
for the women's voices. “It's a real kind

Grinnell College sorely lacking faculty of color

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer '

“Ci-eating and maintaining a ciillur—
ally dtverxc faculty is our priorrry We
have several program: in place to ensure
that we attract and :main minority fut»
ulty.” rCharles Duke, in “Grlnnell: A
Community of Individuals”

The Grinnell College administration
has insisted that it is sincerely dedicated
to creating a diverse faculty. Yet many
students and current faculty members see
the administration as only superficially
dedicated. Although issues are raised by
students and faculty alike, opinions vary
on whether these concerns are adequately
addressed.

Grinnell College promises its students
not only an excellent education, but a die
verse one. “At a liberal arts college like
Grinnell, importance is laid not only on
academic excellence, but [on] social de—
velopmcnl, , to gain from various ex-
pericnccs, . .[io] have the opportunity of
interacting with people from other cul-
tures," explained Rishi Misra ‘01, Many
members of the administration, faculty
and student body feel that Grinnell is nol

living up to its promises.

Who has the power to implement
change?

Some Griniiellians suggest that ihcic
is not enough money being devoted to the
recruiting and hiring of more facility of
color, and cite the 757 million dollar on-
dowmcnt as proof of ability to pay.
“Maybe the pcoplc who make the dcci.
sions are so disconnected from the needs
cfihc students that they cannot filthom
the improvement to the institution," said
an anonymous professor

Frank Thomas, \’lCB»pl'eSl(lClll of Hu-
man Resources and Spccl‘ol Projects, de-
fends the college's polrcrcs. “[Grinncll
College] is making a sincere effort to re-
cruii minority faculty, We are undertak-
ing tremendous efforts to find, select, and
appoint minority faculty," Why. then, are
there still so few minciiucs Ill [be I‘aculiy‘.7

Students have cited ll hostile social
cnvuonmcnt us one explanation its to why
the situation has not implovcd. Hormul
Batlibot '00 said, “us :i person ofcolur.l
don't feel very comfortable when I go into
town , .so I find it hard to imagine that
minority professors and then fumilies
would feel comfortable living in the come

munlty," ,

In conlrasl, Frank Thotnus believes that
the college does "try and gel them to have
a sense tlnit'we have a IlllllOllly commur
nity wiilun the town and that there IS ti
stable community that exists Iicre "

Gautain Ghosh, a lecturer in Allllerr
pology and a Consortium fni ti Strong

patliizes WlflI faculty who don't feel com-
fortable, “[1] imagine there are a lot of
ways, .nmc] might feel less than fully
comfortable both in the college and in the
town," If the col go does indeed make
the cfforts that it c cums, it is unclear why
minority faculty still feel uncomfortable,

Ful'clell‘iplc, some prospective minor-
iiy faculty may find it undesirable to rep-
rcscnt an entire minority gioup lo the

AmeriCOrps:
one option

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

A crowd of people gathered around a
table in the post office yesterday as
AmeriCorps presented their materials to
Grinnell College. Interest in such service
organizations is widespread, and many

, people showed interest in applying for

AmeriCorps. Grinnell has traditionally
had several people every year go into ser-
vice organizations after graduation.

The goal of AmenCorps is to work
with underprivileged communities to
improve their neighborhoods. Some ser-
vices thnt volunteers provrde include tu-
toring, recruiting, and renovation of
housing. Also, a special program in
AmeriCorps. National Civilian Commu-
nlty Corps. is dedicated to improving the
environment.

In AmeriCorps VISTA, volunteers es-
tablisli lasting programs that will con-
tinue after the volunteers have left, “[We]
have people from the community work
within their communities," said Annika
Lister Stroope, an AmeriCorps volunteer
and representative.

how can we address or overcome them?

What is being done to attract more
minority scholars to Grinnell?

Among the college’s solutions to the
problem include the Consortium for a
Strong Minority Presence (CSMP) and
llle Minority Scholars in Residence
(MSIR) progmtns.

The goril of the CSMP program is to
“find a way to increase the number of
minority faculty in liberal arts colleges,"
said Frank Thomas, who is director of
the program, “[but] these goals have a
long way to go,"

Aficr their one year stay, CSMP fel-
lows may be invited to stay In a tenure

is under no obligation to invite the
scholar to continue. Although the CSMP
