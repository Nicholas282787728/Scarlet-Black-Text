boycott the Bar on Saturday night.
”BoycoltingtheBarisagoodthing,
but it's only a step," said ﬁrst-year
student Beth Kizzie.

as "a salt shaker and a pepper
shaker." The Others, said Kizzie,
"nodded and laughed ill agree-
ment

The next moming Kizzie and
Eldringhoff filed a harssmenl
complaint with Steven Jones. also
ciate dean of student affairs. who
then called the police.

Chief Daniel Boyer said that
there was no official charge filed
with his station because the two
students could give only a vague
description of their verbal assail-
ants. "Students should report such
incidents immediately after they
happen In order for us to react,"

Federal Law Confronts
College Alcohol Policies

By Kim Eckart

A recent federal law that out-
lines procedures for drug and alco-
holrabuse prevention may affect
Grinnell‘s current alcohol policy.
The Drungree Schools and Com»
munities Act requires all colleges
and universiLies nationwide to
comply by October 1 in order to
receive federal funds.

The Department of Education
mandates that institutions certify
their implementation of programs
which “prevent the illicit use of
drugs and the abuse of alcohol by
studean and employees.” Such
programs should be based on flve
general points in Section 22 of the
Act. “Drug-Free S chools and Cam-
puses."

According to Jennifer Krohn,
associate dean of Student Affairs.
the drug/alcohol subcommittee of
the Committee on Student Life
(CSL)isdiscussing how Grinnell‘s
currentalcoholpolicy meshes with
the Act. “it is highly probable for
some changes to be made," said
Krohn. “But we're at the point

where students should be aware of
Lhepossibilityofchange. Wedon’t
know yet whatthe changes are going
to be."

Krohn said that the subcommit-
teeplans foran open fomm onCSL
policy rocommendaLionsbefore the
October deadline. The proposed
policy would then be submitted to
President Drake,

Steven Jones. associate dean of
Student Affairs and the chair of the
drug/alcohol subcommittee. said
that the ﬁve points of the Act as
well as the current alcohol policy
are under review. “We’re trying to
insure that we can come up with
viable alternatives to our current
policy which complywith thelaws."
he said.

Grinnell’s drug and alcohol
policy. located on pages 9940] of
the Student Handbook. refers to the
Iowa state law regarding persons
under legal age and the consump-
tion of alcohol in public areas. The
college policy designates the loca-
tions where alcohol may be cone
