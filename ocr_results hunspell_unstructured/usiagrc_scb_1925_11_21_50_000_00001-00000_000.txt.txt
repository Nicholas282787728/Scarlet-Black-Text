This is the first national student Cour

entirely in the hands of student com—

lieury Crone, rationally Known Lec-
turer Spooks to Grilllleli huh.
enccs, on Thursday.

During his stay on the local cam-
pus Thursday Dr. Henry Crane, na-
tionally known lecturer, spoke at
morning chapel, in the A. R. H. audi—
torium at 11:20. and at night in Her-
rick chapel.

In his chapel address the main
theme was “Narrow the way, broad
the life; broad the way, narrow the
life." Before the freshmen education
classes and a large number of visitors
in the Ann. H., Dr. Crane discussed
the four essentials of christianity.

The first of these essentials, ac—
cording to Dr. Crane, is clear thinkr
ing. He stated that Christianity is a
religion which begins thought life,
ond that Jesus turned the command-
ments hack into the mind. The sin
which is committed by the mind is
for more injurious to purity of char-
acter than any outward act, from
which it follows that one should
never go in thought where to go in
body would be Contamination.

”To love our fellow men sincerely,"
is the second of Christianity's essen—
tial constituents, Dr. Crane spent
considerable time in decrying Amer-
lea's exclusion of the oriental raced.
Before we incurred Japan's hatred by
that action, citizens of the United
States were received with greater
cordiality in Nippon than were the
residents of any other country, and
this goodwill was partly enhanced by
our generous aid following the Tokio
earthquake. Almost overnight, how—
ever, the stupidity of Congress for-
felted this slow growth of decades.

The speaker’s third exhortation
was, “Act from honest motives purc—
ly,” Action is the expression of life,
and every bad tendency should be
killed by failure to act upon it, Good-
ness, he continued, is not a gift of
nature, but an act attained solely by
practice.

In conclusion.
hcavcn Securely," Crane urged.
lievc with all that is in you
righteousness is more potent
evil; that right is stronger
Wrong; that honesty is better
dishonesty."

In his evening address at the
chapel he presented an explanation
of the parable concerning the five
wise and the five fnfilish virgins,
winch he said had been worked out
In cooperation with his uncle, Dr.
Frank ‘ranc. Since “the foolish wo-
men are the most interesting," he
confined his attention solely to those
who SCt forth with gleaming lamps,
which were, however, devoid of oil.
They represent types of people, who
believe that if they have the para.-
pllallfllia, no motivating force is nec—
ccssary.

Tho first foolish virgin symbolizes
those who carry around the lamp of
religion without the oil of righteous-
ness. some women religously wor-
