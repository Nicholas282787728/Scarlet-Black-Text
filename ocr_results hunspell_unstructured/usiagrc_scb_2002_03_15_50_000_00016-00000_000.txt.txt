more or less where rl-ieir [cam will ﬁnish ar
the end of Lhc season.

There are several general facrors that
can help a team to a dynasry_or a spot
in the cellaribut there is hardly a ser
formula forsuccess, In rhc end, the trends
are as varied as she 20 varsity sports played
at Grinnell.

Individual dominance

One such trend is that individual spans
seem to be the raisiest ones to establish domi»
nanm.

Grinnell men’s cross Country is rhc most
obvious example, The team has won four
straight and 14 out ofrhe last 15 Midwest
Conference rirles.

This is nothing new, however. Sinoe
l960e62, no thrceeyear span has passed
where rhrcc different schools won confere
ence in men's cross country. On Ll'lc woman's
side, ir had never happened before Carroll
won this year, following up titles by
Lawrence and Belair.

Tmc re the trend, Monmouth has taken
eight of the last ll crowns in men’s indoor
track. and only ﬁve schools have won con-
ference at all in rhc last is years ofwomcn’s
track Even Knox has an individual sports
dynasty, ns men's golf teams have won 17
ofrhe last 20 conferenos rides and have the
WC: most effective and longerunning
stranglehold.

planarion for crinnell cross eoiinrry-s cone

“wc win every year because our guys
run more miles. run those miles harder,
riain over the summer and beeausewehave
a bigger team, and thus more deprh,"
lawrencr said. “The omcr teams in our
oonfcrcnre do nor have as much financial
supporr for their reams. In some cases, die
coaches of other teams in our confercnoe
are not even affiliated with the college, bur
are jusrciriacns orrhc eommuniry. I ques-
tion whomer many ofour conference ops
ponenrs run at all over the summer."

Team effort

The individual sport dynasrynile is not
a universal formula, though. For example,
MWC women's tennis have only had two
teams put together a successive string of
champions in dating back to 1978. still,
try establishing a consistently dominant
force in a team sport like foorball, where
six schools won titles in the '905 and only
one progmmﬁSr, Norbert—ha: won diree
straight solo titles since 1953.

Team sporrs have another problem:
with so many complex systems involved
wirh having multiple people on a field of
play, losing an experienced senior who
knows rhc system can hurr more rhan it
does elsewhere. Two years ago, Grinncll
men’s basketball won conference wrrh its
unique fullvcourI-press system. The P10»

pling number. But those players had run
Grinnell's system throughout their careers,
and wirh that loss of erpcrionoe and lame
whow, rhe team Fell to fourth in the MWC
and had to claw irs way to the postseason
with a .500 overall record,

“Leadership may not play as much ofa
parrin individualsporrs, though irdocs play

some," baskcrhall player sieve Wood '04
said, “Bur in ihose sports you can be self
motivated. You can be good in an individual
sport wichoui rhe ream, whereas in a room
sport dao captains and leaders are hard to
replace. I think rhats what happened this
year with us. we losr some good basketball
players, bur [also] good leaders, who really
knew how ro deal with ream chemistry,”

Other factors

still, some spores—both individual and
reamirend so be more competitive over
die long term rhan others, a fact that deﬁes
iliesc explanations. A possible key is in how
ail-llems select a college. Some, like basket-
ball plzyu' Steve Nordlund'OA. lookin rheir
college search for strong programs to
complement their skills.

“i would say [diescarch for a good pro.

tant thing is that it gives you a good reason
to look into a school [that you otherwise
might not know abourl,” Nordlund said.

The swimming example

Swimming head coach Erin Hurley
knows something about sucwx; her team
has won four srmight MWC ritlcs, includ-
ing one rhis year by the larger margin of
victory in conference hisrory.

“This is an interesting factor for an in.
dividual sport, Hurley said This allows
Mayan: on the team an opportunity to
make a difference in what is seen as an in-
dividual sporr. Hence we have a team cf-
fort.

“The last factor is to get this individual
sport team to compete as team," Hurley
concluded. “Bad chemisrry can negatively
impact an individual sport just like it can a
ream sporr. People need to be able to work
together. The breakdown might not be as

March Madness can’t live up to its reputation

Amidst all my recent emails in my inbox sii some of the most
surprising messages of the year. No, they'ic not die ones telling me
that “HOT LADIESAREWAITING FORYOU!" and rhar lead ro
sires ofill repiiro (which. in. told, don't even have any hor ladies on
chem).

lnsread, they're the lirde innocent looking mes»

1 suppose, it being well lnro rhc

somehow it snuck up on me this year

The emails lm gcrring nboul the rouinamenr arcnr ofrhe infer»

rournamcnr pool s. some for fabulous prize and some for [he more

l, abhorring gambling'in all in forms, ofcoirrse choose not to

might lose money beeause he has no idea what he’s doing, nor really
any idea what rcano are playing in rhc tournament rhis year.” clearly
Division l men’s basketball is not my forte.

That's probably whyI wasn'riorpecring March Madness misyoar_
it’s just not exciting so me. anldy, I’ve never undersrood rhe “mada
nose” part. lr seems like all March Madness is, is more of rho same
basketball rhars been going on for months

Some will argue thar the mumamcm games are more exciting
because so much is on the line Bur really, the only thing rhars on the
line for me when l warch rhe games is whether or nor I ll get ro see a

whole secrion offans wirh those cool

foam fingers on,
it seems like the NCAA could
do a lor more to makc March mad-
dcr. Changing how rournament
games are played would be stair. How abour requiring players to be
blindfolded for the second halfof every game? Or reinstituring rhe
wearing of errra short basketball shore for every game? Now thars

what I all mad.

Thcrliangia don’revon haverobe ardial; even small gimmido would
gcr me more inrcresrod Perhaps the NCAA could simply come up widaa

Actually, in nor sure even rhose changes would gcr mc ercited
about March Madness. 1 rhink I have roo much on my mind at this
time of the year to think abour baskerbsll. like tho whole planning
for sfrer graduation thing coupled wirh the wondering when it will
turn into spring gluesrion. perhaps ld warch more basketball ifrhey
were televised with simultanoous weather forecasts and a soorhing
voice assuring me that I m not going to die in the real world.

I think that is what’s or the heart of my apathy for March Mada
now-I just don't see how it’s relevanr so my life. other sporring
things i can relate to: watching foorball satisﬁes my penr up need to
run into people. but baskerbnll? i suppose ifl had a primal need to
run frantically for an hour or so and make my shoes squeak on hard.
wood floors I could symparhrae, bur [hose seem to be needs I was
born wirhour.

sadly, then, I'm planning on letting another March Madnea slip
away barely noticed. l won't icrnpr fare by cnrering any rournamcnr
pools. i won't tempt my sanity by listening to Dick Viralc franriially
ramble on. i probably won't even wareh any games before the Final
Four.

Unless, ofeourse, rhoysrarr broadcasting blindfolded games on
rho weather Channel. Then I’ll hardly be able to turn away
