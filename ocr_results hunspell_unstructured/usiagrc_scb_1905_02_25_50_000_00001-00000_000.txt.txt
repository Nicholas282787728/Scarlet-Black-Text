THE CORNELL DEBATE.

The Third Annual Donna: on the Tcnrh
cl Maruh~Cnmell will Bring
Big Delegation.

0n liar-ch telltll, Gl'inllcll debaters
will meet their Cornell opponents on
the debating platform. This will be
the Lllil'd and the decisive contest and
without doubt will prove even more
successiul than the last two, which
to say the least were above con-
demnation in their general results.
The question is the primary election
law, Grinnell upholding the proposi-
tion that such a law should be passed.
it is a timely question and one which
not only interests debatcls but serious
legislators in every progressive state.

This contest will be held in Grill-
nail and ii the luturc hold true to the
present prospects. Cornell will bring
down a big host of loyal students as
they did two years ago. All upper
classmeli remembei too, how Grinnell
returned the compliment last year
with such a thrill or college spizit,
that the clients are uridcnteyen to
this day. ‘

The coming d e b at o must prove
equally successful.‘ Grillllellites, ’both
young and old, male and female, Jew
and Gentile, bond and Iree,mnst show
to the coming debaters and visitors a
spirit like unto [hat or 1904, which
will instill courage in the hearts or our
team and producearorce which will
be irresistable whether it bein debate,
athletics, or college work or any kind.

The executive committee which con-
sists of William E. Paul. Mr. J. P. Ry-
an and L. T. Carney have been formu-
lating general plans and appointing
‘oornmittees. The result or their ap»
pointmcnts are as follows: Committee

iOWA WINS ONE.

 

Wearers or The old Gold Win a Cham-
pionship Gam: From Grinneli
Large Audience Present. l

Last night in the new Gymnltsiilm
lit lowh City occurred one of the last-
est games or basket ball ever played
between Iowa and Grinuell. The gal-
lery space was taxed to the utmost in
order to accomodate the hundreds oi
spectators

A game between the freshmen and
sophomore girls was called as a curtain
raise and furnished :an excellent in-
trot] action {or the evening’s entertain-
ment. It was about 8: when the two
teams representing Iowa and Grinnell
respectively were summoned to the
Iloor. After a short preliminary work
out the big Contest was on. The ieel~
ing of conﬁdence which prevailed
throughout the audience was slightly
damperod by the speedy work of the
Scarlet and Black during the lirst ten
minutes or play. Iowa was taken com-
pleLely off her leer. by 3 successive bos-
kels together with one Iolll, Grinnell
was placed nicely in the lead, which
place she held until the last few min»
utes of the ﬁrst half. Iowa gradually
began to pull together and succeeded
in leaving the score 8 to 7 in her favor
at the and of the ﬁrst half, Perhaps
the best exhibition of basket ball on
the part or Grmucil was produced dur-
ing Lhishali and had Wilder been able
to bag iouls properly the big end or
score would easily have read in favor
of the Scarlet and Black.

The second lialtstai‘ted Iowa's Way

and it soon became evident that Grin-
nell could not follow the pace set for
her although at no time was the
breach large. During this hair Brun-
dage was changed to iorward and Bel-
den went back to guard which change
proved profitable.

play. Gritﬁth, as usual, stun-ed for his
team with Barton running a close sec.

light for the Grinnell bunch and sucr

The ﬁlial score was 2747. DeHaan
rater-ed the igame and Brown of Iowa
acted in rhe capacity ci umpire. There
was little reason for complaint in re-
gard to the oniciating although at
times the audience demonstrated their
feelings in a very uncomplimentary
way.

CLARK wle CONTEST.

 

Cornell’s Champion in erurory Once More
Wins Victory lor the Royal Purple7
Second Place to Wesleyan.

Tile annual Iowa Inter-Collegiate
0i atorical Contest took place last
evening in the Cornell College auditor--
ium and resulted, as had been foreseen
by man, in an easy and overwhelming
victory for Mr. Fred J. Clark. Marri-
ingsof the judges have not yet been
received but it may saicly be said that
lie secured ﬁrst place from me. ,of the
Judges on delivery.

   

 

The college auditorium was ﬁlled to
overnowmg some ti me belorc the coli-
test began and for half an houl'rlhe
air was vibrant with the college yells
of enthusiastic supporters. Tile ten-
siou Oi listening to 50 many (nations
was broken at intervals in the program
by the excellent music of the Cornell
College Orchestra, Ladies’ Chorus,
Adelphiﬂn Double Quartctte, and
Professor c. Miller on the pipe organ.

“1. A. Tenor of Iowa State College
was ﬁrst speaker with ”The Maan
Eloquence,” a'euiogy of the orator.
Mr. Taber‘s delivery was remarkable
for its strength; the audience felt the
man back of the words: It was in tact
almost too emphatic and heavy, with
not enough variation. It overwhelm»
ed rather than won.

“Democi'acy’s Worst Enemy” was
the subject of Iowa College's repre-
sentative, William Cochran. Mr.
Coclli'ltne’s delivery was characterized
by case on the platform and ircodom
of gestures. His beginning was strong
and held the audience closely, but he
was unfortunate in having suffered
from a severe cold [or the past week,
which injured his Voice and Caused the
latter part of his address to be weak-
ened. ,

Whatever may be one's vlewof Mn.
Clark’s second participation in the
State Contest with his last year‘s ora-
Lion, “The Philosophy of the Race
Problem,” none will deny that he
deierved his place. Much improve
menu was noted in strength or voles-
aod cml‘ectness oi emphasis. MI.
Clark‘s oration, to borrow one of its
dgures, was a highly polished gem.
Both composition and delivery were as
near perfection as years of ceaseless
endeavor and experience can make
them.

Mr. E. 0. hotel or Simpson Collage
had a good oration oirhu typical bio.
graphical type on "The Mission or
Savonarold.” his voice was good; the
principal criticism would bcthc lack
or harmony with the thought in
gestures and attitudes oi the body.

Mr. Henry Mcunstoroi Iowa Wes.
leyan University, won second place
with his oration, “Tile True Basis or
Sovereignty”—Dcmonracy. The speak-
er took Americans the typicai'statc on
whose endurance rests the iuture or

true sovereignty. The subject is an
Cdnlinued on Fourl‘n Page.
