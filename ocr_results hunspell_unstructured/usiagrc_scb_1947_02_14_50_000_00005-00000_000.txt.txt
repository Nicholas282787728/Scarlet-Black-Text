Explain Swim
Meet Scorin

By George Erb »

There has been much specula-
tion among members of the stu-
dent body on the question of how
the Pioneer swimming meets are
i scored. The average student is un<
able to understand the scoring
system because he never sees the
meet scored by evean, hut mere—
ly the total score.

Each event is scored on s fivee‘
three-one basis. Thus. a team gets
ﬁve points for a first place, three}
tor a second, and one for a third}
There are a few exceptions and di-’
.rersious from this general rule,‘
however. The ISO-yard medley rc-
lay and the leoeyard free style re-
lay are scored so that neither
team can achieve too great an
overlilance of points. In the mede

 

lay, the winning Lem gets six

points and the 105mg oumt three:
in the free stylc the winners reap
eight points against the losers'
rour. '

The final puzzling event is the
diving competition. Team scoring
remains on the five-three-two has

race. the winners must be determ-
ined in a different mannerr Each
diver must execute a plain from.
