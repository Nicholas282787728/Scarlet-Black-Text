While upperclassmen are getting reat-
quaiuted with friends and faculty members
as the new school year begins, Dean of Stu—
dents Travis Greene, much like a first—year, is
still adapting to his surroundings.

Taking on his new position only a month
and a half ago, Greene has begun to adjust
to his new job, a position which is also new
to campus,

Prior to this year, there was not a dean
of students position at Grinnell. But after
Dean of Student Life Jennifer Ktohn moved
to the Office of the President at the end of
last year, administrators decided to combine
her position with the Dean of Residential
Life, thereby creating the Dean ofStudentsa

Greene‘s position now covers studcnt hous- .

ing issues as well as programs such as New
Student Orientation, Student Staff, and In-
tercultural Affairs.

in his first months working at Grinnell,
Grccnc has been actively working with stu-
dents, according to Houston Dougharty, vice
president of Student Affairs. “Already, he is
working with the SGA to evaluate the stus
dent handbook and make it more valuetdriw
en instead of rulesdriven,“ Doughurty said.
“I think we can expect Travis to have some
visioning in all areas he is responsible for the
years to come."

John Burrows '10, SGA vice president
of Student Affairs, has also worked with
Greene and applauded his resourcefulness
in accommodating (ht; housing issues faced
earlier in the year (See “nrst-years,“ pg. 1).
“He’s already shown himselfto be a great as
set planning the conversions of lounges and
trunk room into extta dorm rooms to make
sure the large incoming class would all have
places to live," Burrows said.

Greene brings Grinnell residential ch
pertise in fields ofresident life, multicultural
and intercultural affairs, and student con-
duct from work in places such as Iowa state.
“Vi/e’ve never had someone who had expertise
in all these areas before," Dougharty said.

Greene began his college eirperience at
St. Olaf, a small liberal arts college in North-
field, MN. After graduating in 1996, Greene
went on to work at Iowa State University,
where Dougharty also worked, as an LGBT
coordinator. Greene would cross Doughatty’s
path again this past summer, where Greene
worked as an intern at Lewis and Clark Cole

sidewalk, or even popping in at some Harris

parties,” he said. “Because I know that there

is no way ofbe'mg able to help the students if
you don’t know them.”

With a strong applicant
pool numbering over 40 candi»
dates, deciding who would be-
come the new dean vlms a tough
decision according to Burrows,
who took part in the search.
"Wc had three ﬁnalists who we
invited to the campus for a tour
and to meet student groups as
well as faculty and staff meme
bers," Burrows said.

“Travis impressed me with how much he
already knew about Grinnell and seemed like

lege in Portlan, Oregon. As evident from his
past work, Greene has experience in small
schools, Iowa and places where Dougharty
has worked. making his
new position at Grinnell all
the more appropriate.
Greene said he has felt
comfortable interacting
with students on a daily
basis, which will make up a
large amount of his job. “I
love being in this position
where it is your job to have
a relationship with the stw
dents and be an advocate of them," he said.
Greene plans to he a presence on campus.

one who would uphold the Grinncll values,"
he said.

Overall. Greene has found a welcom-
ing environment in his ﬁrst weeks, noting
that Grinnellians overall have a healthy hale
ance between themselves and the campus. “I
feel like Gtinnell is the best of all worlds,"
Greene said.

“When I was at St. Olaf, everyone had
such a strong sense of community that no
one was really an individual, and when 1 was
at the School of the Art Institute at Chi-
cago, everyone was their own self and there
was no sense of community," Greene said ”at
Grinnell, I feel the sense of community, but
at the same time,everyone is their own funky
self."
