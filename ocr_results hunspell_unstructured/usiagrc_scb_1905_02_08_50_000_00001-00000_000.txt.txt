BASKET BALL AT DES MOINES

Grinnell Meets First Dclsai ol’ the Sea-
son at the Hands of Association
Men.

Tire basket ball team representing
Iowa College met its ﬁrst defeat oi
the sedSUll Saturday night at the hands
of the Des Moines Y, M. c. A. .\iter
torty minutes of the hardest play that
our team has experienced it was
forced to leave the door defeated but
not discouraged. The Des Moines
team took the lead atthe star-t and the
Grinnell side or the score was only
kept up by accurate foul throwing.
After ﬁve minutes of play the wearers
of thescarlet and black began to pull
together and the gap in the score was
practically closed by the end or the
l-li-sthali', the board reading 17-15 in
favor of the Des Moines ii 9. Probdb~
ly the best work of the evening ior the
Grrinnell team was done during the

last part of the Lirst half.

Both tcams appeared on the lloor
for the second hall with a spirit or de-
termination, but it soon became rcry
evident- to the close observer that the
chumctcri tic ginger of the Grinch
bunch was lat ting. though the results
of the game at e\ery stage were in
doubt. Any relax in the play
oi the association te'am iii iglrt
easilyhavetlrrown victory to the other-
side Captain Clark probably did the
best work of the evening ior his team
and at all times managed to keepa
spiritiii his men which was no small
factor in the outcome of the game
Littleinore need be said concerning
the play or the Griiiriell o'vc than that
they all played hard and consistent
ball. The otliciating was apparently
satisfactory toallcou’cerued. DeHaan
acted in the capacity of referee while
Rule took charge of the umpiriug.

TRACK ATHLETICS.
Call to be Made Early in March for All
Candidates to Appear—Two
Duals in Sighr.

Vol.

As the track season approaches
there are many inuurries with the res
gard to the beginning of training, the
policy of the management and the
meets which will he held driving the
season. wnileitis still too early ior
these unestions to be answered def-
initely and with detail yet there are
certain riicts which may well be given
at this time ior the information or all
interested in track work.

There will be no general call ior
candidates for the track team until
the tirst or second week in March.
whcn anchor-t will be made to have
as many men as possible begin regular
training ior the home meet. Mean
tiuie, in connection with the regular-
gymnasium classes the new men will
have a chance to try their skill at
several 01 the events which will be
contested in the pring meets. Pros
pective sprinters will be girorrachance
to learn nuick starting indoors. jump
e will be shown sourctning or the
pl'opel'liirm in making the high and
longleaps, pole vaultcrs and llllrillels
will be able to develop some skill be-
low outdoor work begins and shot
putters and distance men will have
opportunity to work at their respec-
the events, It is ottcn the case that
new men undecided for which
evonttlicy are best ﬁtted and grow
discouraged when tested by the
standards of experienced track men.
For this reason the preliminary will'k
as now given should enable the begin-
ners to get some idea of the event [or
nhichthey are best titted and giro
therna degree or coulidence which
‘wouhl not corneii they started work
at the same time with the older men.

This much may be said for the bane-
lit’ol' the new men who are undecided

about the event which they had best
train l'or. loua Cullegc is not fortu-
nate enough th' year to have sure
point wiiinevsin many or the events
which are contested in dual and state
meets, in two or three events there
are single men who may be depended
upon to win some points for the scare
let rind black this season, but there is
plenty of opportunity for new man in
each event. Tire college will be in es-
pecial need or new mom in the di. ance
runs and weight events while tor the
high yrinip arirl pole vault there is not,
asingle candidate in sight. The pole
vault and 1H] rdlo races all'ortl great op»
portnnrty l'oriiew men who arcwrll-
ing to work faithfully. These are
events reuuirrng consular-alive skill. an
item which can be no put-oil wr. ,lvird
practice. Mr. Flsho urllb‘e at HDPI'»

track team candidates.

The management has not yet unto.»
dctinite arrangements, ior any dual
meets but is in correspondence with
brake, Amos and the University of
Missouri. Dual mects with two or
the above schools is practically certain.
