TRAINER WATSON.

From 77m/lr/l/rtrx',lfullrliu, pub
lished in. Boston, Mass, we clip
tlielfollowing concerning Trainer
Watson:

“Mr,Watson ot New York City

has arrived at Grinilell and will
coach their track team this year.
Mr. Watson not only knows how
to train others, but he is an ‘ele
gant all round track athlete him-
self."—Des Moincs Review.

Not of New York; Boston. He
is an elegant all round athlete,
We would like to know ofa better
one. As a trmner he is among the
best, and it one of the leading
Universities had him they would
never regret it. Watson ought to
do a great deal [or the Gi'iiinell
college boys as he is probably the
most experienced man in the

The ,

 

United States. Many trainers
could get points from Watson. J.
B. Connolly, the Athenian chain
pion, thinks him one of the best
athletic trainers in the country.
