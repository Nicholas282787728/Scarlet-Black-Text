SUPPORT VIA ENTHUSIASM
The Grinuell collc *c studcnt hody rcspolldcd
gracefully to tllc sllgg stion of tllc pep committee
that it accompany the football team to the train
bcforc the Marquette contest. .
. One might even say tllat it rcspolldcd enthuse
lastically, and its support certainly had its share

in the Tartarlikc showing made by the Pioneers at'

Milwaukee. Only a team. battling with every last
ounce of strength, backed by school spiri could
have repelled tllc Avalanche at the goal line six
times as Grinncll tlid.

‘ The question remains, will tlle students con-
tinue? They will be given another opportunity to
send their tcam away to a tough fracus tomorrow
noon when the squad leaves for Dctriot. It won’t
be as easy to go to the station and rllsll back as
it was to keep the date out an extra half hour last
week.

Of course the student body is back‘of the
team. The: never has been ally question of the
Pioneer spi . That must not be tacit support, how-
ever, Silence never helped to ii'll‘l a ball game.

The team has a tough schedule this Season, with
a trio of really hard games ill a row and all of
them on foreign territory The Grinncll clcvcn is
light, and if it \v'ns, it must do so on speed, on-
thusitlsni, and spirit. Give the team a hand.

I‘mNGKEN‘S RABBITS IN COLLEGE

The senior class meeting Monday boasted an
attendance of about 40 out of a class of 115. This
condition is noticeable not only in class organiza-
tions, but ill almost every organization on the cam-
pus. The situation is bcwailcd on every hand, but
as yet no steps have been taken to remedy it.

Undoubtedly no steps ever will be taken to
remedy the sad plight of Grinncll organizations,
because any improvement, if such is to occur, must
come from a change ill the attitude of the students
making up the organizations, and not from any
superﬁcial “steps” or “resolutions” or “laws.”

The present condition is due to the attitude of
the student which makes him join organizations
for the. mere sake of belonging, and not because
of an interest in the work of the organization, It
is duo to the same attitude that makes students
take more activities than they can handle, so that
they do a number of things poorly and no one
thing il'cll. Only when this attitude is replaced by
one of realization of responsibility to the organiza-
tioil and interest in its work will there ever be any
improvement ill the attendance situation. and all
that it signiﬁes in the way of lack of interest and
slipshod wor . '

This childish attitude that at present c. 'sts
among collcgc students is not peculiar to them
alone, for it is the great point of criticism of the
rank mid ﬁle of the American people today. It. is
the Character ‘tic of the habits that thc Menckclls
most delight to hold up to ridicule.

Commonplaccllcss is no virtue, however, and
the really successful men of today are those who
have discovered that coliccntration on the subjects
of greatest intel . , and the acceptance of rcspoilr
sibility of citizenship or membership in the organi
zation, as the case may be is the most direct path
to tllc goal of :1 succcS'ful lifc. Too great divcl ills
cation and half-way participation ill the ac vitics
of lifc lead to the disintigration of personally.

CAMPUS SMOKING DIMJNISHES

Smoking on the campus has greatly diminished
this year. The smoke screens have shifted from the
Alumni Recitation hall archways, and the piles of
butts have disappeared.

The Lantern society and the Honor G club,
which passed resolutions on this matter last Spring,
deserve congratulations and thanks. May the rce
form continue.

GRINNELL’S PRESIDENT EVER YOUNG
(From the Des Moincs Register)

As a member of president Main's ofﬁcial “family,"
I wish to thank the Tribune-Capital for. its editorial on
the president's many years of service to Grinnell and
Iowa. Such an editorial belies the statement occasion-ally
made by Grinnell's eastern friends that the college is
insufﬁciently appreciated by her own constituency.

Your editorial writer hit with accuracy upon the
fundamental quality of Dr. Main’s personality, which is
his perennial youthfulness. In an 'age marked by almost
continuous changes in every ﬁeld of life, President Main
has kept abreast of the times, refusing to condemn the
new simply because it differs from the old. It is probably
this freshness of spirit in him which binds every alert
student to the president in the fceling that they are
sharing together a great adventure.

Dr. Mom has repeatedly demonstrated his belief in
complete freedom of teachings, in the independence of
education from political or denominational control. and
in the sharing of college government with the student
body. His whole career has been an effort to embody
these principles in the fabric of Grinnell life,

Every ﬁrst year class is told by the president that
“college is not preparation for life, but is life itself."
He visualizes colleve as a laboratory where students
may test the vali ty of social and economic experi-
ments, for use or discard in later life.

Iowa some day will honor John Hanson Thomas
Main as one of her most significant contributors togiproi‘
gress in education.

Robert Burlingame,
associate to the president
of Grinnell college.

UNFAIR ‘COLLEGE’ MOVIES
(From the Daily Iowan)

About this time each year a ﬂood of “collegiate"
motion pictures is released. The college sheik with his
ﬂashy roadster, loud clothes, wild parties, beautiful but
dumb girls, last minute touchdowns. etc., are all pictured
as typical of campus life.

Those who do not know the real life or the general
conditions of American college life may cake the movie
version as the truth. But there is enough romance,
comedy, action, and beauty on every campus to provide
innumerable plots without distorting the facts. Movie-
goers would-perhaps be more satisfied with the true
view. ,

It is time that motion picture producers correct the
false impressions they have created about the under-
graduate students of American colleges and universities.

HARVARD TABOOS ‘RAH-RAHISM’
(From the Boston Evening Transcript)

Harvard always has seasoned athletes with a. good
measure of common sense, but the Cambridge attitude
was never better expressed than in William J. Bing-
hdm’s remarks to the freshman class a night or two ago.
“During the year," the director of athletics said, “we
shall engage in no less than 375 intercollegiate games.
The prestige of the college does not depend on any of
these contests. . . . No one will accuse you of having
‘poor spirit’ if you prefer to spend a Saturday afternoon
at the library rather than to attend a football game.
No coach will urge you to play any game for the glory
of dear old Harvard."

This sane point of view may seem beyond need of
comment, but there are hundreds of American college
alumni now living who heard nothing like it during
their undergraduate days. Twenty years ago at almost
any eastern college the head coach exhorted the in—
coming freshmen somewhat as follows: “Now, rememr
ber, it isn't. enough to attend every game. No matter
whether or not you can play any football, you fellows—
all of you~be down at the field euch afternoon to watch
the practice. Show that team you're behind it every
minute of the seasonr' And when the coach had said
his say, the football captain recited the same gospel
with equal emphasis, and the president of the senior
honor society told it again for extra measure.

Thereafter, punctually at 3:30 p.rri., even on the
best autumn days, scores of freshmen who ought to
have been securing exercise of their own on court or
links would be down at the football ﬁeld watching the
other men exercise. AS for spending the afternoon of
a game in the library rather than on the grandstand,
this was considered a crime worthy of social capital
punishment, even when committed merely as an isolated
or very occasional offense.

But Bingham spoke from sounder ground when he
stated the Harvard policy, and Capt. Benjamin Tieknor,
the vorsity’s all-American center, supported him. It is
the Harvard idea to get along without rah—rabism. Let
men take up a sport because they like it, see the good of
it, and wish to contribute of their best to it. On that
basis, as Tiekner rightly said, Harvard's athletes have
always shown on the ﬁeld a remarkable amount of team
spirit.

But the idea that spectators can win games by the
intensity of their gaze and the power of their lungs is
not exalted at Harvard, ﬁrstly, because such pressure
does not seem an especially admirable test of inward
spirit, and, secondly, because the idea that games can
be so won in nine-tenths a fallacy.

Dear Sir:

Knowing that the Grinnell football
team comes here Friday night for
the game with the University of Der
troit, I am sending you a couple of
clippings from the local papers. You
may want a little ”dope" on the team
here, '

The Detroit team appeared to be
rather weak at the beginning of the
season, but in their two games have
showed a surprising strength. Our
Grinnell team will have its hands
full on Friday, but I feel the scarlet
and black will take good care of it-
self.

I am looking for a mighty oven
contest. We alumni are taking a sec-
tion of tickets and expect to be on
hand to root for the old school. The

team may be coming into foreign
