Before she went to Europe, Miss
Mock, who is a Californian, attended
summer sessions at the University
of California. She spoke of the

In conclusion Miles said that while

SATURDAY, APRIL 12, 1930.

When Small Machines
Were Big

MORE than a quarter century ago,
the Commonwealth Edison Com-

pany, prophetically alive to the
immense possibilities of the future,
ordered from General Electric 9. 5000-
kilowatr steam turbine—in those days
a giant of electric power.

To-day, a General Electric turbine-
generator of 208,000-kilowatt capacity
sends out its vast energy to the Chicago
Metropolitan District. '

College-trained men played a. respon-
sible part in the engineering ahd
manufacture of both machines—just
as they serve in important capacities
in the engineering, production, and
distribution of all General Electric
equipment, large or small.
