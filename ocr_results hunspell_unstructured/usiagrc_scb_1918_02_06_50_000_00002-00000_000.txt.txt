S. 0. i.

A humorous column is illcllllled in
student newspapers of the leading colr
lcges and universities in the country.
Most of the really great metropolitan
newspapers also hate such a column
as one of the popular icaiui-cs. l

The Scarlet and Black initiated such
a column only niter hccoming cons,
vinccd that Illel'e was a desire tor itl
among its own subscribers. it has
met with a chorus ol appreciative and
mommy criticism. It has met with a
small amount of sarcastic criticism
iiom individuals who cithsr lacked a
sense of humor or were unwilling to
take thc column in thc spirit it was
meant.

What 8. 0. s. and other contributors
may thiul s humor may not appeal to
the next individual, but someone else
is llliel)‘ to target his troubles reading
it. t

If you don’t like 5. o. 5., don‘t rcadl
it. If you like part of it, and can’t
stand the rest, send your criticism to
The Scarlet and Black and it will re-
celve the most sci-ious consideration.
If you think your idea or humor is belr
tcr thin that of s. 0. 3., you are in-
ritcd to write the column and siiomir
it to the staff of The Scarlet and Black.
And to the rest of you, who read it
lioth with pleasure and pain, become a]
regular contrlhntor, and your fame‘
may become greater than that or
