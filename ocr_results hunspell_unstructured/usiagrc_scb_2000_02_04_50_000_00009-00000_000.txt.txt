US. Women’s soccer salary increase represents long overdue score

By Tracy Batman
The Daily Cavalier (UVA)

(U—Wire) Charlottesville,
VA—- When the U.5. women's
soccer national team beat
China to win the 1999 World
Cup, the team made head—
lines.around the country All
of a sudden, women’s soccer
became a sport that people re»
spected and watched, and it
supposedly did wonderful
things to help achieve gender
equity in professional sports.

For many people, the U.S.
team represented what was
pure and good in sports—-
people playing purely for the
love of the game.

But when headlines hit
newsstands a month ago say—
ing the same team refused to
play in the Australia Cup be»
cause ofa salary dispute, they
were criticized for their lack
of dedication.

Honestly, when I heard
1ere was a salary dispute bee
ween the women and the

US. Soccer Federation, I re—
ally didn’t give it too much
thought. These people prob—
ably were making more than
enough money already, I
thought. And I believed the
USSF did the right thing by
sending a team composed of
college—age players to the Aus—
tralia Cup last month.

But it wasn’t until the dis-
pute was on its way to being
resolved that I realized how
right the women were to boy
cott the Australia Cup.

Think about it. This is a
team that has won the Olym-
pics and the World Cup, both
held in the United States. The
squad has broken every record
there was for women's sports
attendance numbers and
boasted a greater turnout
than the Us. men's team ever
has achieved.

Yet, these same women,
named Sports Illustrated’s
Sportswomen of the Year in
December, earned a toral of
$3,150 a month to train and

$250 per game. They also re»
ceived a $2,500 roster bonus
for making the World Cup
roster.

By my ﬁgures, that totals
about $45,000 a year. While
that salary might not seem
low, these Women are Olym»
pians and have proven them»
selves the greatest athletes in
the world in their sport.

And what did they get for
winning the World Cup title?
They took home $12,500.

This is still a signiﬁcant
amount of money, but not
when compared to the men’s
soccer team. The men on the
1998 World Cup team earned
a $20,000 bonus for being
named to the roster, The
men, who ﬁnished dead last,
each received $35,000 for
their efforts - and they would
have taken home over
$400,000 had they won the
World Cup.

While the women’s team
definitely provided the ﬁrst
step to gender equality in

sports, the pay situation
doesn’t exactly show young
women in the United States
that women and men are
equal in terms ofathlctics.

And given the circumv
stances, these women are
one-hundred percentjustiﬁed
in boycotting the Australia
Cup.

The dispute finally came
to an end Saturday when the
team agreed to a ﬂve»year
contract. The women, who
began training yesterday for
their exhibition Sunday
against Norway, will receive
about $130,000 a year in sala»
ties and bonuses, The New
York Times reported.

It’s still not close to what
the men are earning, but it is
another step in the right di-
tection.

I applauded the Women
for their accomplishments
this summer. But after the
conclusion of the ”salary dis-
pute," they should get a
standing ovation.

A message
from SGA

To the campus community:

I encourage the Grinnell
community to get involved
this semester in the discussion
about the Capstone experi—
ence. We are in the middle of
a 5—year experiment of thd
Capstone. What happens af—
ter this test—run will be deter»
mined by the results of our
experiences.

I encourage everyone to
consider what the Capstone
is. Should it be an individual
effort, or group work? Shoul
it be within one’s major, or in
terdisciplinary? Should it ex—
ist at all here?

There are signs up in resi-
dence halls and in academi
buildings explaining in more
detail the Capstone as it i
currently being carried out.
Please read them, think about
them and get involved in the
discussion,

Thank you.
