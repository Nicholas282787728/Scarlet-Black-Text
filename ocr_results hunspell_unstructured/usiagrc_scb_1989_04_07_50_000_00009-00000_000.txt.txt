Max Beckmann show in
Iowa City one more week

by Dan Capone

Back just before break, an
exhibition of works by Max
Beckmann opened at the Univer-
sity of Iowa Museum of Art.
The Show, up through April 17,
includes 45 prints and the trip-
tycli K ameval .

Beekmann was trained as an
academic painter, but became
disillusioned after the first world
war and turned to German Ex-
pressionism. Although best
known for his paintings, he pro-
duced almost 350 prints during
his career. Prcferring lithography
and drypoint over woodcut, he
fairly evenly divided his attention
between those two media. The
majority of his prints, and his

most powerful drypoints, date
fr0m191171924.

A notable exception included
in this exhibit, is a rare hand-
colored edition of his 1946 series
of 15 lithographs, Day and
Dreams. This series, executed
four years before his death, com-
bines litany of the themes and
subjects he worked with
throughout his career: biblical
and mythological subjects, ihc
circus, the cafe.

The exhibit is open, free of
charge, at the University or Iowa
Museum of Art. For more

Caccamo goes solo in
South Lounge tonight

by Heather James

His music has been performed
and well received worldwide. He
has toured London, Italy, Min-
nesota, Texas, and even Kansas
City. And now. after along ab-
sence, he returns to those who
knew him well. . .when he was
only a little guy war own Jim
Caccamo. Once again you will
have the opportunity to enjoy his
music and bad jokes as he carries
on the long tradition of Chris
Rhoads-Jim Caccamo South
Lounge extmvaganzas. This time
he will be appearing solo,
presenting his own music: a
version of British pop in me vein
of the Beatles. the Police. and
XTC.

Relying entirely on original
material, Jim offers the Grinnell
student a unique change of pace.
“I ﬁnd that I express myself much
better through my own words
rather than those of other people.
The songs run the gamut from
silly love songs to serious love
songs to attempts at social
commentary. But the underlying
thcmt: is always relationships,
Either one on one or on a larger
scale. it‘s all people dealing wtth
people."

Finding a stylistic
comparison for Jim's music is
not easy. “I’m not some Stevte
Ray Vaughn or Eddie Van l—ltilen,
but ain ntucll more of a Itillies
Taylor. After all, we both have

the same first name. In fact llle
only difference is that he is a
little taller than me. . . And like
Taylor, iny means of expression
comes more through voice and
lyrical content rather titan a single
instrument. For me. a song is
communication as a whole and
not just an outlet for expression
through a guitar solo or a rhythm
section.” One might even wonder
why he uses his guitar: “It's so I
have time to breathe between
sentences."

So come to South Lounge on
Friday night at 9 pm. Hear Jim
communicate. Watch him
breathe. He is excellent on both
counts, and promises to provide a
relaxing and entertaining evening
