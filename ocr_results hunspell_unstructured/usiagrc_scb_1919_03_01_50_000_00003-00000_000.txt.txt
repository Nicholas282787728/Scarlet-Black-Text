nople. We shall not he in Rome more
than twh DY three dﬂYS,—just long
enough to meet some of [he gavel-hr
merit officials.

"on Friday night we had a delight-
in] little Grinnell reunion. There were
twelve present and cveiy one gave
his war experiences and every one or
them, excepting my own “WAR" ex-
perience, was intensely interesting.
rrolessor Peck was the master of cer—
emonies and promised to send a lull
report to Gl'innell. .

Days nave Been strenuous.

“The days here have been strenuous
ones. We have had a great many
things to do preliminary to our start
tor the Near East. The problems of
transportation have given us much

trouble; but in these matters the or '

lied goveinments (including of course
the U. s.) have been always ready to
co-operatc. We have at present about
16,000 tons of supplies on the sea

hundred workers of all kinds. The

Versatile Verse
THE ' ‘HLNKEIL

Back or the boating hammer
By which the steel is wrought,
Back of the wurkshop’s clamor
The seeker may ﬁnd Thought.
The Thought that is ever master or
iron and. steam and steel,
That rises above disaster
And tranipies it under heel.
The drudge may tret and tinker or
labor with dusty blows
But back or him stands the Thinker,
The clear eyed man who knows;
For into each plow or saber. 2
Each piece and part and whole,
Must go the Brain‘s of Labor-
Which gaves the worn a soul!
Back of the motors humming.
Back or the bolts that sing,
Back at the hammers drumming,
Back ot the cranes that swing,
There is the eye which scans them
watching through stores and strain,
There is the Mind which plans them—
Back ol the brawn, the Brain!
Might of the roaring hoiler,
Force or the engine’s thrust,
Strength of the sweating toiler,
Greatly in thee we trust
But back of them stands the Schemer,
The Thinker who drives things
through;
Back oi the JohiThe Dreamer
Who's making the dreams. come
true!

BARRERE ENSEMBLE PLAYS
VARIED l’ROGRAM—HTSTRU-
)LEN'I‘S INCLUDE OBOES,

BASSONS, AN]! F L U ’1‘ E

When George Barrere gave his ﬁrst
concert in New York in 1911 with his
now famous Barrere Ensemble or

Wind Instruments, the press at once‘

admitted it to a triumph such as is in-
deed rarely accorded to a musical un-
dertakiug.

As to its excellence there was not a
single dissenting voice, while a unani-
mous hope was expressed that it might
endure, for, as the N. Y. Tribune put it
“In the establishing or this organiza-
tion Mr, Barrere has placed New
York in his debt.” Two publications,
however, expressed a doubt as to

 

whether constant interest in this type
or music could be maintained with ”so
liiuitcd a repertoire."

Play Modern Material.

These, however, reckoned without
the conjurer Bari-ere, (or with the
same wave or his silver wand which
disclosed the unsuspectcd beauties of
the wind instruments themselves, be
also brought to light, not only a vol~
inniiious library or classic composi-
tions for the wind instruments, but
also an astonishing amount of modern
material, mainly from the pens or
been added to by many of our own
composers.

For several years Bari-ere at his ser~
ics or annual concerts in New York
never repeated a single number, in
fact when he was ﬁnally prevailed
upon to repc t “by request” a well
liked ecniposi on, he conceded the
matter with reluctance. From time to
time he has included arrangements
but those only when the compositions
were such as to make them eminently
iiditptiihle, as for instance, "The
Frogs" by Geo. W. Chadwick, or Mac
Dowell's “Woodland Sketches", both
of which are redolent of the wood
wind.
