Familial Troubles Seen
inOrdinary People

By Brett Fcchheimer

The Jarreth are ideal residents
of upperrmiddle—class suburbia.
Parents Calvin and Beth Jarrett are
a good-looking, 40-ish couple:
clean-cut, upwardly mobile and
undoubtedly smart enough to have
their lawn mowed in the proper
direction, So what’s wrong with
this picture? That’s the question
that the 1980mm Ordinary People
explores. Directed by Robert
RedfordandlnsedonludithGuest's
novel. “Ordinary People" is a real—
istic and sober film about coping
with loss, coming to grips with
emotion and the delicate proccess
of familial reconciliation.

Ordinary People begins soon

Conmd (Timothy Hutton), is re»
leased from a mental hospital. He
had been institutionalized after his

brother's death in a boating acci~
dent, for which Conrad feels re
sponsible. After his release, his
parents (Donald Sutherland and
Mary Tyler Moore) try to help
Conrad, but theirown confused and
repressed emotions often get in the
way. All of the Jarrelts would like
a return to normalcy. but none of
them knows how to go about ob-

superbly acted, moderately paced
and extremely moving. As it was
filmed in the suburbs north ofChi-

recognize some of the movie's

Daniel Day Lewis
Shines in Left Foot

By Danelle Baker

Chlisty Brown does not want
oursympathy. He does not wish for
the title “great cripple painter." He
wants simply to throw back the
cloak of darlmess, the isolation cast
upon his vulnerable forth. My Left
F oar, starring Daniel Day Lewis, is
precisely that: Christy Brown’s
flightirom fmility to freedom, with
the might of a clenched and driven
spirit as the only guide.

As a chronological view of
Brown’s life with periodic ﬂashes
lo Lhe present, My Left Fool begins
with Christy‘s birth, rift with com»
plications. The roots of his spirit
are visible in his childhood, set in
the dim years of the early 1930’s in
Dublin. He is a child severely dis-
abled by cerebral palsy, yet is
yanked fmm self-pity byhismother
(Brenda Fricker) who loves him
with a blind ferocity. Patty Brown,
Christy’s father, is a hard-drinking
Irish man leaning toward abuse,
though he embraces signs of
Christy's intelligence as ifpushing
a bud Inward bloom.

Awkward grasps for a typical
adolescence punctuate Christy’s
youth. l-leis scorned and retreats to
the private side ofself. Hislel't foot
is all that is duly functional, and it
becomes his medium to the outside
world. Through disappointmentand
discovery, 3 portion of Christy‘s

soul erupts: he is an artist.
Edging fanher beyond the shell
of disability, Chrisly endures then
apy with Dr. Eileen Coun. l-le
gains control physically, yet nears
personal destruction when Eileen
will not reciprocate his love. After
it downward spiritual spiral, he re-
gains hope, and is victorious on a
personal level and in thepublishing
of his autobiographyMyLeilFoot.
My Left Fool is only narrowly a
u-ibute to Christy’s talents. Rather,
it is the story of a triumph of the
will. l-lispursuitoftheartsdoesnot
rest on a logical foundation, it is
simply zl bolt from the blue, it sponr
mneous light to the depths within.
Equally as astounding is the per
formance of Day Lewis. He is a
vulnerable distortion. parading the
spectrum of satire to the aching
core of sadness. Dublin casts a
serene setting: characters are still-
lives on the landscape, aglow with
the strength of the Irish. “Let us
drink to Dublin.” states Mary Carr,
Christy’s eventual wife, “for it is
where Christy Brown was born."

9 Ways to Sunday has Unique
Blend of Musical Elements

By Chris Doemel and
Sarah Quimby

Take a couple of vocalists, an
electric guitarapercussionislanda
keyboardist, and what is the result?
A basic rock hand. But add a cello,
apiano, acousticguitars, a harmony
ica and other exotic instruments,
and it is now the group 9 Ways to
Sunday.

Admitedly,wedidn’tknow what
to expect to hear from 9 Ways, but
we werepleasantly surprised atwhat
we found. And we’d love to men-
tion the title, but we couldn’tflnd it
on the album, even though we
looked everywhere. However, it’s
the only album we’ve seen that has
a painting by Seurat on the cover.
Have fun looking. We did.

In a music review, this fact may
seem insigniﬁcanl,butthe painting
on the cover reﬂects the music in-
side. In the same way that Seurat
blends light and color to create a
beautiful painting,9Waysblendsa

unique assortment of instruments,
vocals and m usic to create an excel-
lent album.

A song typical of 9 Ways to
Sunday’s style is “Restless.” This
Songbeginswilhasolo banjowhich
is suddenly replaced by an up—tempo
drum beatin a remarkably smooth
u-ansition. With most of the songs.
9Ways emphasizes themusicrather
than thelyrics, achievingn remark—
able sound at the expense of long,
topical lyrics.

Instead of containing biting so
cial criticisms, 9 Ways produces
more poetic lyrics that are nonethe-
less powerful. Also, the vocal ar-
rangements contributeto the power
of the lyrics rather than dc—empha-
size them, as happens with other
hands. This makes 9 Ways more
interesting and a pleasure to hear.

Then midway through the song.
in space normally reserved for a
screaming guitar solo or an impro-
vised drum solo, there is a surprise
for the listener: a cello solo. 9

Ways to Heaven often includes
Uteseunusualinterludes,usingother
instruments such as a piano, a har-
monica and others. While this in»
strumentatron is very unusual in
most rock music, 9 Ways handles it
extremely well, and it blends in
perfectly with the drums and elec-
tric guitars around it.

9 Ways also experimenu with
introductions and endings to their
songs. One example is the pseudo
heavy metal beginning of “Come
Tell Me Now,” a song that ends
with music that sounds remarkably
Indian.

The songs on the album seldom
last over4 minutes (only two break
the 4-minute mark), making the
entire playing time of the album
just under 40 minutes long. Yet»
these short songs do not distract the
listener; one is seldom left hanging
in the middle of the music.

One criticism of 9 Ways is its
repetitive drum patterns, which
often slay the same throughout the
majority of the song. Just once or
twice, it would have been nice to
hear even a short drum solo in the
midst of 9 Ways’ music.

The band has found a unique
niche in progressive music by
combining electrical and acoustic
sounds in an unusual way. While
some listeners may ﬁnd 9 Ways’
music mild or boring in places, it
still presents a pleasant change of
pace from the music of many other
progressive groups. A.
