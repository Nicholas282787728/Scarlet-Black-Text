Average

Room
'Not
Horrible’

by Greg Sayre

Last week the 8&5 ran a housing survey
Via the mailboxes. About 125 were returned.
General impressions of the results are as
follows:

If you're drawing a room, you should check
out more than size, location, and whether
there is a sink, for example, numbers of
outlets and type of furniture. Some prob—
lems can usually be discovered only from
the occupant: banging pipes, roaches, bats,
drahs, heat extremes, leaks, and smells.
There's one room on James lst in which
you can’t control the heat hecuase the room’s
radiator, which is usually on, acts as the
dorm’s thermostat. Some rooms, like one
in Clark Basement, are‘noisy by nature;
this one is near the lounge andaroom where
Buildings and Grounds people work early in
the mornings. The only safe chance on get-
ting a very good room is bypersonal recomr
mendation. And, if you want a water bed,
draw a basement room.

By dorms, Main (2 complaints returned)
came out well, people disliklng the view, or
the size of the room, and requesting minor
repairs. Mears (3 complaints) also rated
high, with one leak and a small closet on
3rd floor. In Cleveland, 2 rooms (232 and
226 on 2nd) were recommended, one leak
on 2nd was reported, and more minor rer
pairs were requested for a basement room.

Regarding minor repairs, Ralph Pomev
renk, Business Manager, outlined the most
fruitful channel of getting things fixed: the
student complains to a member of his hall’s
housekeeping staff, who then fills out a
“Fix It Slip”, of which hundreds are pro-
cessed per week. The slip passes to the
North or South Campus housekeeping superr
visor and on to one of three physical plant
supervisors who then dispatches people
from the carpentry, plumbing, electrician,
or painting crew to the room. The College
also hires an exterminator to handle pest
complaints. The questionnaires which men-
tioned B KLG reported that the problems were
fixed, or why they couldn’t be fixed (no
rollers to replace broken Norris windows),
Most of the structural problems reported
dealt with unrepairable items (clanking
pipes, thin walls) or with nearly universal
problems (cracked plaster, temperature
extremes).

Haines Hall (3 complaints) rated much
higher than James (9). In the latter, two
leaks were reported on 2nd, and one in the
basement. On first floor at least, there is

only one outlet per room. The ilaines come
plaints referred to a thin wall and minor
repairs in the basement, and on 2ndawarped
door, a leak, temperatures, and the place-
ments of the closets and sink in two of the
suites. Read basement (4 complaints) rated
very low, with “paper thin connecting
doors", hugs, and some or all rooms with-
out sinks. Two leaks were reported on 2nd;
no comment from the rest of Read. Loose
people (9 complaints, 1 recommendation --
Basement Rm 606) disliked some hot and
cold extremes in the basement, the metal
furniture on the upper ﬂoors, heat pipes,
plaster, and noise from each other.

On North Campus, Rawson(only three com
plaints, but it’s small) and the Younkers
(4 from North, 3 from South) Came in with
the fewest gripes, Rawson basement and
second mention the omnipresent clanking
pipes and occasional falling plaster, with
bugs and low water pressure in a second
flnur room. Some Younker 3rd floor rooms
are dratty, bugs can come in the windows
which are only halfway screened, and a
radiator or two in South basement won't
turn off. Student noise was mentioned.
Cowles 2nd (3) was more disliked than 3rd
(1), and one room on 3rd (766) was even
recommended. Second floor mentioned in—
sects, a sewage smell, and above all,
noise. One person recommended drawing
adjoining singles in pairs, so "you could
choose who yuu want to know your life
secrets." The first floor rooms sufferfrom
lounge noise.

East (6) and West (9) Norris drew many
complaints. The roach infestation, it seems
from the questionnaires, is far greater in
East than West. Both second floors reported
a great deal of noise due to thin walls and
heating ducts, and the northern side of both
dorms tends to be cold in winter. The light-
ing is reported inadequate and thecorridors
narrow, but people like the View and several
times at the end of a long list of dislikes
people reported that they kind of liked their
rooms anyway, mostly due to the people
around them. Of course, not all think so
“All Norris rooms should be singles or
destroyed.”

oh the rest of North Campus, Smith (6)and
Clark (5) rated high, with 3 positive recom-
mendations each: Clark an Ems 529 and
”third on right”, Clark 534, Smith 10001.1”.
suite), Smith Basement 104, and Smith 2nd
121 Smith complaints included a smell from
plumbing in the basement, cracked plaster,
paint, and leak in the annex. noise, roaches,
and no cold water on second, and echoes and
a cracked window on 3rd. Dibble (5) mane
tioned smells from a private bathroom on
lst, minor repairs needed and poor paint
and plaster in the annex, bats, no cold water,
bad plaster, and a magnificent view of Nor-
ris on 2nd, and another sewage odor in one
room of a triple on 3rd. Gates (7) and Lane
gan (6) rated average on number and sever—
ity of problems. Pipes and plaster were
mentioned four times in Gates Pit, and there
is a window leak on second, and a fine large
room with bugs (434) on third. Lnngnn base-
ment boasts of a double which has been 2
inches deep in water after good rainstorms,
but is probably now fixed by 8 ft G. Also

in the pit is a room with an uneven floor,
and a huge single (200) with loud pipes. Lan-
gan lst had some bad linoleum, and has a
few roaches and a few minor bad points, and
a girl on 3rd dislikes the springetype faur
cets.

In general and in summary, a person with
a had number is likely to be pretty disap-
pointed with campus housing, and a person
with a good number may easily make a mise
take. The most serious dormitory problem
is lack of privacy, and those to whom prie
vacy is very important are recommended
to start looking for an apartment. But a
person with an average number who does a
iair amount of legwork is likely to do all
right, if not very well, Judging partly from
the rate of return on the questionnaires and
partly from their content, the average room
at Grinnell is not horrible.

To
Utilize
Houses For

More Students

by David Crow

Four of five more collegerowned houses
in town will be opened for student living next
year in order to provide housing for about
forty more students, the College administra-
tion has informed the 58:13. Part of the rear
son is to provide greater capacity for the
large number of students, and part is to
permit reconversion oi former study lounr
ges in which about twenty Students now live.

These buildings will be ”first-level” con-
versions on the pattern of the present resi»
dances at 1217 and 1227 Park Street. The
capacity of both of these buildings is now
about a persons, and the capacity of the new
units will be about the same. The conversion
process involves the installation of interior
and exterior locks on doors, telephones,
rugs, drapes, and extra furniture. A kitchr
enette in the style of those in the residence
balls is provided as well.

The conversion of collegerowned houses
is an advantageous way for the college to
provtde extra housing since it is relatively
easy to do as compared with the financially
impossible alternative of building another
dormitory. Furthermore the houses, many
of which were formerly rented tothe faculty,
can be easily reconverted ’to that use.

Such houses were used this year as emer-
gency housing tor an unexpectedly large
student body, and therefore the living situar
Hons there ha‘le been somewhat unfortunate.
in some cases the occupants are virtually
all freshmen, and the student deans found
