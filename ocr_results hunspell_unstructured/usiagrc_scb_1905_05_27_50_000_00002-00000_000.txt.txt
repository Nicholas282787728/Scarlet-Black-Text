DOUBTEDLY one oi the ﬁrst

duties or liie is the periormance
01' the obligation oi oi eiy organization
and every individual to rualre history,
aid in melting history to leave a sane-
tion on all that is good in what has
gone before and to acid such prece-
oent as may be worthy oi iollowiug in
thel'nture Iisncli be the case, the
ladies of the class or 1905 have not
only lived up to all that can he hoped
{or in them but they hare made a
unique contribution which entitles
them to the thanlrs or those who at-
tended the reception oi a week ago
and to the plaudits oi the generations
yet unknown. A lawn party so clercr.
ly planned and taetliilly handled as
the one oi last weclr would be wel-
coined by allconcerned as a supe
tirely desirable ieature oi ererv Spring
term. There are many indeed who
hope Lo see the custom perpetuated

which has been begun so nuspicou‘sly.
