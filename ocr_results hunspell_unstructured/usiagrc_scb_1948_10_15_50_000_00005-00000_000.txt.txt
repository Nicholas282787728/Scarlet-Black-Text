Hart Tells

Church Fought

Against Spread
Of Communism

The Italian election last spring
was the main subject of Dr.
Henry Hart's talk, “Propaganda.
for the 1lliterate," before the
IRC club yesterday evening,
Hart touched upon
lights of the election, which was
so critical in checking the spread
of Communism.

“The church group was the
greatest factor in the defeat of
the Communists in Italy,” Hart
told the club. “Forced to speak
directly to the people, due to the

high percentage of illiteracy Ln .

Italy, they did so right from the
pulpit to stop the Red party.”
Hart, a member of the faculty
of the University of Califo- ia,
spent five months in Europe this
year studying the current situate
‘ tion there, and was present in
Italy during the elections. He
will leave the campus some time
today after a visit of ten days,
“The Communists str ve to
make direct contact with the
working classes, especially in
country areas where illiteracy is

extremely high," he said. “Usual-"
ly they would make lavish prom-‘

iscs to take action on issues im~
portant to the prospective voter
if they were elected.”

Hart also touched upon‘the
fact that Americans took an ac-
tive part in swinging the elem
tion in favor of the Christian
Democratic party with money and
food. .

However, if a veteran feels his
check has been unduly delayed,
he should first contact his college

tthat the school has his complete
enrollment information, and then
icolitact the nearest VA office.

the people perish”, and he knows
that vision does not conncte vis-

not mean mil'agermongel'ing.

The idealist is inspired by his
understanding that Jesus came
into the world not to preach
creeds and theories and theolo-
gies. but to teach great ideals
and to practice the principle that
“\Ve are all members one of am
other,” The brotherhood of man
,is a magnificent ideal, yet it is
‘also an actuality, attainable, al-
though slowly, in real truth.
