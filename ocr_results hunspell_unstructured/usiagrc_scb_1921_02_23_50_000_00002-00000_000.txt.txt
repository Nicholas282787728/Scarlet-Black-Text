A CASE OF INDIFFERENCI}.

An event which was probably second
only to the commencement program in
signiﬁcance occurred in chapel yester-
day morning, and in spite oi its im-
portance as a paragraph in the history
oi the college, no more interest was’
present in the student body than it
nothing but the regular daily chapel .
service had occurred. ‘

We cannot but wonder, when well
look over the vacant seats in the auth-l
torium at a time like,this. whether or
not all regard of things that do liot‘
have the element of entertainment. in
the sense that they either excite o'_r
humor the hear-er, is becoming absent l
in the malieup or the modern college
student. in casually looking over the
audience at the service, which was a
combined celebration of the three hun- .
dl‘mlth‘annivel‘sary oi the landing cm
the Pilgrims, the seventy-ﬁlth annivers;
sary of the founding of the college;
and of Washington's birthday, therel
were probably not more than twenty—
ﬁve memhers or the senior class in
attendance. ’

still, the ‘average student would
agree that such services are important,
and even vital in the activities or a
college. If some provision were not

made for such festivities, it would he

said or the college that nothing WﬂSl
going on, that the college was dead, or
, that there was no one here with
enough amhition to put such things

 

across. 1
But one of the unique things about

Grinnell is its appreciation of these
memorable events, and its enthusiasm
with which it honors the traditions oi
the old Pioneers, and still it looks as
if not enough students were suffic—
iently interested, or would even attend
trom a matter of duty. to crawl out or
bed at ten o’clock in the morning and
be present at line of the most memor-
able programs that they will he priv—
ileged'to witness while in college. .‘

People go out of their Way to wit-l
ness the chair in which some great,
"man sat. We hear of some people he‘
lug such fanatics for the unique as to
go clear across a continent to see the
place where a great battle was toughi,
when there is nothing there but a
Cornﬁeld >With perhaps a small tablet
or monument with an inscription on it
locating the place of surrender.

Here We have to go only a few steps
from our rooms to the chapel to hear
about the founding of the College
which we proiess to hold so high, and
the history of this College consists of
the must adventurous and hazardous
all stories of great Pioneers, and the
majority of us either have not the am-
bitiun, or lack the realization of thc

‘trne signiﬁcance of the occasion, to
make the effort.

We cannot but look back to the cele—
bration of last year or the seventy-
fourth anniversary Of Founders' Day,
when men from Edward, from Dart»
mouth, Amherst, Yale, Bowdoin, and
other great institutions which are rec
sponsiblc l'ur Grinnell's starting. came
out west to look over their offspring.
and help celebrate its success They
were unanimous in their expression of
admiration for the college that they
had helped build up. but the dumb
mulls question wasi‘WV'nere are the
students?" There was me only bitch
in the program; the students failed in
realize the signiﬁcance of the occa—
sion, and failed to turn out.

What would a popular vote of the
student body have said, it it had been
