McCray resigns

JB refuses SGACabinet salary increase

by Kim MacDonald

Although the budget for the spring
semester passed with less than three
amendments, one of the casualties of
this Wednesday's Joint Board meeting
was the resignation of the third Student
Government Association cabinet
imember this year. Julia McCray, who
served as administrative assistant and
election _board Chairman, resigned
because she felt the Joint Board’s
refusal to increase ﬂ'ie salaries of the
cabinet members was a “vote of no
confidence,"

One of the changes on the proposed
$563,000 budget submitted by the‘_
Finance Committee was to increase the
combined salaries of the 12 paid posi-
tions on the SGA a total of $647, This
figure was originally submitted in the
fall budget but last spring the Joint
Board decreased the cabinet salaries
because of the general tightening of the
budget. However, a motion was in-
troduced to move $512 of the proposed
salary increase to the film budget.

It was stressed that the motion to
decrease the cabinet's salary was not a
reflection on the ability of the members
but rather an attempt to Spread the
money over a wider protion of the cam:
pus. SGA president Paul Volker felt
that while the refusal to increase their
salary was not necessarily a vote of no-
confidence. he "would have viewed an

increase as a Vote of confidence.”
Volker added that he believed the Job of
administrative as5istant was "the most
thankless" and McCray herself said she
was finding fewer and fewer rewards
especially after this semester‘s elecs
lions.

Treasurer Shari Raularid, who work-
ed very closeiy on the proposed budget,
argued that cabinet employees were
paid on the average , 68 cents an hour.
which is far below minimum waEe oaid
on other campus jobs. Joint Board
members successlully countered
Kauland s complaint with the
arguments that SGA officials do not run
for their positions because of the salary
but rather for the prestige and ex-
perience, Other arguments touched on
the fact that money for this year has
been very tight and that a greater
number of students would benefit from
an increase in the quality of this
semester's films.

There were various arguments that
the Jomt Board had no respect for the
cabinet and likewise that the cabinet
had no respect for the Joint Board.

Loose Hall President George Turn-
bull felt that the way in which the
budget was submitted to Joint Board
gave the board no time to come up the
relevant opposition He added that the
Joint Board it as to act as a check on the

cabinet and that a submission of a
slightly revised Copy of the budget a
few minutes before the meeting began
that night gave board members no time
to review it. Turnbull then made a mo-
tion to table the budget for a week so JB
could review it,

Rauland explained that the new
budget represented a slightly updated
budget based on recently received
receipts and information. Turnbull's
motion to table the budget failed.

on the other hand, Volker felt that the
refusal to increase the cabinet salaries
was "symptomatic of the way that
Joint Board treats us " He realized that
Joint Board was "very money con-
scious" but he was disappointed in JB
although he understood their reasons.
Volker added that the first semester
Joint Board was "very responsive and
responsible" and he did not feel that
they were financially in ”such bad
shape."

Volker went on to say that the in-
crease would have had "a far greater
affect on salaries" as far as percens
tages go.

The two and one-half hour meeting
which Volker termed "one of the most
melodramatic" ended with Turnbull's
successful motion to commend the
cabinet for all their hard work.

by Ellen Heath

Though the potential was there, the
people were not. Last Tuesday, Feb. 3,
an army recruitment olricer was
scheduled to come to Grinnell, Signs
were posted around campus by the
Democratic Socialist Organizing Com»
mittee (DSOCl urging students to go to
Fell House Tuesday morning to protest
the officer's viSIt Three students show-
ed up but the officer did not so the pro
test never materialized.

When the officer culled Deb Stuart.
director of Career Services, to confirm
his viSIt, he was told that a few students
might be at Fell House, where he was to
have been set up, passing out pam»
phlets on conscientious objection to the
draft. The officer then said he would
have to cancel his trip because it was
the policy of the recruitment office to
keep a lovirprofile. He wanted to avoid
what he termed a "demonstration.“

Stuart said that two students had
come to her a week ago when they
learned of the officer 5 scheduled Visit
and asked if they could hand out the
literature while he was here. Stuart told
them they could and notified the of-
ficers when he called because, she said,
“i thought it was only fair to warn him

February o, 198!

that there might be someone sitting on
the steps when he got here,"

DSUC planned to set up a table on the
porch of Fell House to hand out leaflets
on the Peace Corp and alternatives to
the serVice as well as conscientious ob-
Jection There were also supposed to be
a few people With signs protesting the
recruiter's Visit. Two students with
leuflels went to Fell House on the
designated morning but left when they
found out the officer would not be
there,

One signrcarrying student, Rob
Schwartz, Vient to Fell House‘Tuesday
morning not to hand out pamphlets but
to "demonstrate the fact that the
recruitment office came to campus,
as he put it. Schwartz said he thought
"that was great" that the officer had
decided not to come to Grinnell.

The recruitment officer usually
comes to campus once each year. This
year only two students expressed a
desire to meet with him Stuart told the
officer that he can reschedule his visit
but that students would probably react
the some way. As of this writing, the ol-
ticer has not rescheduled,
