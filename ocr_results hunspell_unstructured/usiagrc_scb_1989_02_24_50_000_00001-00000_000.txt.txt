Republic of China and Hang
Kong, said the collection was
established for two reasons.
“One, it provides needed works
for the expanding Chinese
program here. And two, it is a
memorial collection in honor of
my mother (Yu-kuei Feng)," he
said. ,

Feng was born in Guangxi
Province, China, into a well-
known clan that had produced a
long line of scholars since the
18th century. Although her own
education was interrupted by the
Japanese invasions in 1937,
family and friends feel she placed
a premium on education and
worked to ensure that her children
would receive the finest education
possible. Feng died in 1984 after
involvement in a traffic accident
near her farm in the New
Territories, Hong Kong.

The books are not in any one
location but have been distributed
throughout the library according
to subject so that they are readily
available to the students, Hsich
said.

Hsieh said that friends and
relatives of Feng from around the
world contributed to the fund to
honor her and that he began
purchasing the books about three
years ago.

 

 

Health center swamped
Flu epidemic strikes campus

by Bruce Emond

Streaming eyes, high
temperatures, and head congestion
signal the return of that
unwelcome winter visitor,
inﬂuenza. This winter Grinnell
students have been particularly
affected by the flu, with the
health center becoming almost a
second home for afflicted
students. Estimating that on
some days the health center staff
has seen more than 70 students
head nurse Donna Bailey said that
while cases seem to be up in the
town as well, “the campus
community has been hit harder.”
She added that“th student body
seemed more susceptible to than
strain of flu."

Most students reporting to
the health center have exhibited
classic flu symptoms of high
temperatures of 102 to 103
degrees, body and head aches, and
chest coughs. Bailey said one of
the main distinctions between a
cold and the flu is that a cold
usually develops over two to
three days while the onset of flu
symptoms is very rapid.

Fatigue and loss of appetite
often accompany the flu and
many sick students feel too
unwell to altendrclasscs. Senior
Carol Kennedy, one flu victim,
said she has been attending
classes “smr’ld'eallyf' She con-
tinued, "it v rote. 11'ch really

drained and tired. This is not a
good thing to have during the
school year.”

Some students, however,
have been unaware of the
college‘s policy regarding absence
from classes. “It is very
important that students who are
going to miss classes have
communication with the health
center on the days that they will
be absent,” said Bailey. The
health center notifies the Office
of Students Affairs when a
student will miss classes. After a
student is absent from classes for
three consecutive days, the

OSFA’ report calls
student debt low

by Jessica Weiscl
In a recently released study
from the Office of Student
Financial Aid (OSFA), Director
James Lincoln concludes that the
152 seniors who will graduate in
1989 with cumulative dcbls from
need-based sources will have an
average debt of $6,169.29.
Furthermore, the study concludes,
only five seniors, or two percent
of the class, will graduate with
debts exceeding $10,000.
According to Lincoln, the

Loan Indebtedness Report was
produced because federal
regulations stipulate that the
OSFA must give students ”an
indication of the average indebtr
cdness that students have when
they graduate.” Lincoln claimed
that this is the most
comprehensive study in his two
years as director, and said that
OSFA is already beginning an
examination of the class of 1990.

Of the 320 graduating seniors
in the class of 1989, 258 have
received some type of financial
aid. About 36 percent of the
seniors who received aid, 106
students, have no debt to be
repaid after graduation Of the
remaining 158 seniors, five will
have to pay more than $10,000.
57 will have to pay between
$7500 and $9999, 32 will have
to pay between $5000 and $7499.
35 will have to pay between
$2500 and $4999, and 23 will
have to pay less than $2500.

The Loan Indebtedness Report
also makes comparisons between
Grinnell’s class of 1989 and 1984

graduating seniors at 22 private
colleges belonging to the
Consortium on Financing Higher
Education (COFI-IE), including
Carleton, Oberlin, Williams,
Amherst, and Georgetown. The
results of the comparison show
that only 27 percent of 1984
seniors at. COFHE colleges
graduated debufree, wltilc 23
pcrccntgradualtxi with cumulative
debts ofSl0,000 or more.

Lincoln emphasized the fact
that the Grinnell study and the
COFHE study taken from Janet
Hansen‘s 1987 study. Student
Loans: Are They Overburderlirlg
A Generation?, only use data
from what are currently con-
sidered “need-based loan sources.”
These sources are primarily
Grinncll College loans and the
federal Stafford student loans and
Perkins loans. Since Hansen’s
study relies on data taken before
the Higher Education
Amendments of 1986, which
greatly reduced the availability of
the federal loans, and OSFA has
no pre-1986 data, it is unclear
whether the comparison between
1984 and 1989 graduates is valid.
It is possible that the 1986 law
lowered overall loan-indebtedness
at the COFHE colleges because
federal loans were more difficult
to receive. It is also possible
that the law had little effect on
the schools, so 1984 statistics are
better proof of low indebtedness
at Grinnell.
