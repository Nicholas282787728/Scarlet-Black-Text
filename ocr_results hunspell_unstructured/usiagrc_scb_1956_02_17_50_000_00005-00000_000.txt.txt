Pioneer Cagers Invade Illinois;
Siwash, Scol's Seek Revenge

The Grinnell cagers invade
‘lllinois this weekend for two
conference games. The Pioneers
are at Galesbutg tonight against
Knox and then move‘over to
Monmouth tomorrow night.
The illness-stricken Pioneers
after missing key players in re
cent games appear to be intact
for the rough weekend of action
ahead of them. Bob Mchmsey,
who missed the Augustana game
because of the ﬂu, is ‘back in
shape to put the cagers at full

' strength.

. It is almost certain that Knox
and Monmouth plan warm wel-
comes for the Pioneers. They
still remember the double t'rln
umphs Grinnell posted earlier
at Derby and will be out to re-
venge these losses. The results
of these two games can very
well determine which of the
three teams will gain a first di-

Coe continued to pace the rest
of the conference this week With
wins over Lawrence, 77-64, and
Ripon, 67-57 while St. Olaf

ner-up spot, hatching three road

Coe travels to Illinois to face
Monmouth and Knox on rriday
and Saturday. Both teams fell

" to the Coe cagesters earlier in
the season. Cornell remained in
the race by downing a flu-weeks
ened Grinnell team, 71-56. The
Pioneers were missing second
high scorer, Dick Crawl, as well
as other regulars who ‘were
down with the flu.

in other conference play St,
olaf dropped Knox in a double-
overtime thriller, 8743. The
score was dead-locked at 75.75
when the gun sounded ending
the first overtime but in the
second charity period the ole:
moved ahead to stay.

A full schedule of nine con-
ference games is on tap for this
week. st. Olaf is expected to
handle visiting Ripon and Law-
rence this week while Coe is ex-
pected to run into trouble against
the Illinois teams. Cornell has
