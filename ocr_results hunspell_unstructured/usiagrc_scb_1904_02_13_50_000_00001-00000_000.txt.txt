The

rule applres espcctally to baseball
men who play ball in the summer
titne with professional teams and
as has been the case are barred
front taking part in any athletics
of tlte college which they attend,
However. the board holds that
this rule is violated continually
and that only tiotv and then it is
enforced, so that with such a con
dition might as well be repealed.
When their play ball in the
summer time tinder those cortdl
tions, they are not representing
any il‘h‘lllutilm and consequently
there is no reason why they should
be kept out tttren they return to
school. This action of the board
has catt<ed great excitment among
the eastern Schools and it will be
interesting to know the effects on

Some interesting facts have
been brought out in a recent siztter
mettt b) _\I r. Kelchcl, of the Yale
Bureau of Self-Help, regarding
the tippnrntrnents or scholarships
in the two classes of lgoz and 1903
of that university, Out ot the
forty-turn high 65 t scholarships,
ll‘lirlyrllll'cc were won by students
who worked their way through
college and out at this number a
large part were entirely dependent
ontheir own resources. These ﬁg-
ures clearly demonstrate the fact
that the student who works his
way realizes his position and
makes the most of his oppol'tuni»
ties, while on the other hand it
shows just as plainly that the
other type at student does not al.
ways use his energies to the best
advantage.
