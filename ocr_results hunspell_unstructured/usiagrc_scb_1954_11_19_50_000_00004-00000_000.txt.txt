by Jim Wolf

“Playing football develops in
anyone," says Chuck McKay,
“the feeling of competition and
of working with others as a
team for a common cause."

The big Pioneer right guard
hails from Ottawa, lllinois,
where he lettered in football,
track, and basketball during
his high school days. Chuck
came to Grinnell in his sopho-
more year as a transfer student

from Illinois and has played tforl

the Pioneers for only two years.
Besides football, he is out for
swimming this year,

The Honor G member cites
this year’s St. Olaf upset as 1th
most thrilling game of his col.
lege career. “It gave us a real
sense of accomplishment," says
McKay.

“I feel that Grinnell would
have more winning teams,” he
continued, if the student body
would back them 100%. We have
the potential and a little more
help from the stands would put
us out in from.”

Chuck is an economics major
and after finishing up at Grin-
nell he will go into the air

force under the ROTC program,
His plans after that are a hill

hazy, but he would like 10 have
his own business somedayi

Of McKay, Coach Pﬁ'hsch says,

“He is a steady player who can
always be depended upon. in
the two years that he has play-
ed, he has been a great help to
our line,"
