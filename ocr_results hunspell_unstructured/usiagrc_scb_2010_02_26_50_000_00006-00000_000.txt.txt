Aquatic center to open come summer

BYDARWIN MANNING

Ifyou want to swim in the Iowa sunshine come summer,
your optionsjust got considerably better, so get your suit ready.
On June 1 the Grinnell community will be treated to the
grand opening ofthe Grinnell Mutual Family Aquatic Center
located at 8th Avenue and Sunset Street, right across from the
Lion's Park.

"We are saying that it will be open June 1st and at this
point its on schedule, maybe a link ahead ofschedule," Mayor
Canfield said.

The event will surely mean more than just any old day at
the pool to all those involved.

“The ceremony will defrnirely be a special moment for the
town as many people worked diligently to have this project
completed and done well, since the decision to start it two
years ago,"canfield said.

The new aquatic center will replace a pool that had been
around since the fifties, and although rejuvenated in the eight-
ies was quickly aging. It was torn down two years ago as the
construction on the new pool began,

“The old pool was cracked and leaked and the bathhouse
facilities were literally crumpling away,” canfield said.

The Municipal Pool is the last part of a trio of new facilie
ties geared to truly improve the town, along with the Drake
Community Library that opened back in December and the
public safety building that recently opened in January.

Citizens showed interest towards a revamping of the town
when they voted in favor ofa sales tax bond, from which pme
ceeds would support these projects.

"We passed a sales tax bond issue, which passed with a 73
percent approval rating, which is the highest tax approval rat-
ing in the State of Iowa,” Canfreld said.

Three and a third million dollars were collected through
this sales tax for the aquatic center,~but due to the project’s

$5.5 million cost, there was over $2 million that was raised
through private contributions.

Vision Iovm Program or I-Jobs, an $830 million, threeeyear
investment in Iowa's infrastructure encourages projects and
new infrastructure, contributed $100,000, the second largest
donation. Governor Culver was in Grinnell onThursday, Feb.
18, discussing l—Jobs’ contribution and plans for around Iowa.

The Grinnell Mutual Research Center made the two
largest donations with a contribution of $750,000. Due to
Grinnell Mutual‘s large contribution they were given naming
ri hts.

g The Municipal Pool will feature competitive swim lanes
for high school students, a zero edge pool for young children
and a ”lazy river"a water ride thar usually consists ofa shallow
(2 Vi ft. to 3 V2 ft.) pool that has a similar current to a river.
There will also be several diving boards plus two slides.

“It’s going to be a magniﬁcent facility it's going to have
all the bells and whistles that you need for a family aquatic
center," Canﬁeld said.

As the opening nears, the Mayor is well aware of the es—
calating excitement, yet he wants all to know not to expect
anything too radical. “Some people think the Mayor’s going
to slide down the water slide, but I have news for them—I’m
not," Canfleld said.

Economically, the pool will truly be a great boom for the
town, with the number of jobs being created in construction,
maintenance, concessions and lifeguard duty.

“When people look to move into a community they look
for quality of life things, and the aquatic center is one very
attractive thing that families with young children look for,"
Canﬁeld said,

The pool was built by, Burbach Aquatics, which is located
in Platteville, WI. it will stay open from June 1 to the end of
August and will be available to the general public.

NASA-sponsored
Drake Library
space exhibit
informs all ages

E v EMILY BAJET

From Ian.15 through March 26, the Drake Library will
host a NASAs sponsored space extravaganza: Visions of the
Universe. The exhibit, which is designed with small town lie
braries in mind, presents a number ofspacergeated programs
and talks seeking to further educate and inform people re-
moved from a museum.

"NASA's goal was to get information about astronomy into
speciﬁcally small, rural communities,” said Monique Shore,
Drake library's systems administrator, “The idea being thar if
people—children specifically—lived far away from museums
they're not exposed to some of the great new discoveries in 35,
tronomy,"

To wrap up the National Year ofAstronomy, this American
Library Association coordinated event passed through 40 dif-
ferent libraries across the country, ﬁnishing its run at Drake
Library. The main goal of the exhibit is to publicize the accome
plishrnenrs of the Hubble space telescope. NASA provides a
stipend of $500 for astronomy related materials, an educational
sequence ofpanels with information on the Hubble space tele-
scope and a list of contacts for possible speakers during the 10-
week event.

“[NASA] put[s] us in touch with a couple of NASA based
programs that provide free speakers," Shore said. “Several ofthe
Thursday night speakers are a part ofa NASA sponsored pro— ‘
gram called solar system ambassadors who similarly do educae
tional programs throughout the country."

The talks,which are held at 7 pm. every Thursday, include
presentations by professors from the University of Iowa, Iowa
State University and resident Grinnell College professor Bob
Cadmus, Physics, who has an upcoming talk on March 11 ene
titled “Songs ofthe Stars."

“The focus ofl is going to be how the underlying physics
ofstars and musical instruments is the same.. .and part ofitwill
also be about the lives of stars how they were created, what their
lives were like, and how they got to be dying stars and whats
going to happen to them,"Cadmus said. “So itwill be alittle bit
of the lives of stars, a little bit of connection to musical instru»
ments, a little bit of what I actually do but clearly oriented to
public library life,"

besides theThursday night talks, the library offers an after
school astronomy club and other weekend activities, such as a
talk and book signing this Saturday by author Abigail Foerstner
as she speaks on her biography oflowa native James Van Al-
len, which she refers to as the “father of space science". Shore
believes that talks such as Cadmus’ are what give the exhibit its
life, and not simply the panels or numerous offered books on
the subject matter.

“The exhibit is not just the panels," Shore said. “The panels
themselves are interesting and show a fascinating amount of
information but it’s really the programming thatI think is make
ing the exhibit a big success."

In addition to showcasing astronomical development, the
exhibit also allows the newly ﬁnished Drake Library to show—
case itseltiThe event organizers sought additional funding from
Humanities Iowa and Grinnell Tourism in order to ensure the
event is as successful as possible.

"I think they’ve tried and succeeded to do something that
really reaches out to the community," Cadmus said. “This is a
new library, so they saw this, I think, as.. .something that would
bring lots of members of the community to the library early in
its life.”

 

As part of the Visions of the Universe odubir ar Drake Library, author Abigail Foersmer will ralk at 1 pm. on Saturday, Feb. 27 at the Drake
Library about rowan James Van Allen, who is frequently called the father ofspace science. Foersmer has written a book about Allen encltled “James

Van Allen: The First Eight Billion Miles."She will also be signing copies after her presentation.
