BY MAX CALENBERG

While many Grlnnellians have been indoors study —
ing, or occasionally, going to the gym, dining hall or
class, the Grinnell Track team has been doing all
of this and running—31m.

The Midwest Conference (MWC) Indoor
Track season began when students returned
from break and so far everything, including the

day and then the University of Northern Iowa tomorrow.
Senior Captain Liza Btost 10 knows not to put too
much emphasis on the competitive aspect of indoor
season, regardless of the meet, because it all sets up
for the outdoor season.

Winter Break is so long, so really we focus on get-

have a mix of beginners to established top atlls
letes, the team is still a close group"
It's a group that has gotten off to a great start,
with the team touting some of the top runners in
the MVVC in a wide range of events. David Mont-
gomery '10 currently is ranked first in the ch
for both the mile and 3000 meters. Both Fonz Jena
kins '10 and Hugh Redford ’10 are ranked in the
top 10 for pole vault, while Hannah Colter '12 is
ranked ninth in the 3000.1n addition to the dis-
tance runners, Dylan Eoucher '12 and Scott Philips
Y11 are ranked in the top 10 for the 55 meter dash, a
change Montgomery is excited to see due to its big”

“You can't win track meets with just distance
people," Montgomery- said. “This year we really
have a strong sprinting squad so hopefully that
will pay offin the conference meet."

Griunell will see a change in their indoor sea-
son next year when they move into the new athletie
facility. Currently, they run in the PEC, which, Mr
cording to Freeman, has an incredibly poor surface
than can easily cause injury.
“We currently are very selective about what we
do in the PRC due to the tight turn radius and the
hard surface,” Freeman wrote. “It will make a huge
difference in what we can do when we move
across the street,"
Either way, the team can't wait to make the
move outside this season.

weather is like ten times better," Andrew Hirakawa '12 Sat)” Gmhr’lZ”la/Eranrurrrrr/ulpalevaul/atrmptazzrtlfm,
