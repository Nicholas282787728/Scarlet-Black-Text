sion of the Pioneer basketball

1935-36 squad.

Stanley zahler, junior transfer
from Charlton Junior college, is
expected to bolster the Grinnell
forward posts. zahler was high
point man for Charlton last year.
Tull Men Needed.

According to Coach Truesdalc,
there is a possibility that Donald
Ruliffson will be eligible to play
on the team next semester. Ru-
litfson, tall, rangy center of last
year’s squad, is expected to re—
turn to school next semester.

With a shortage of tau men, a
limited number of veterans, and
Nash's iniurcd hand, prospects
for the coming season are not too
bright.

DORIC

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

This week's paragon of penitence
is Doc mes; ever since lrcne
Smith r frigerated him in the
Raven,,his chin has been wear-
ing bruises on his shins. Poor
Doc—he has already boughtanew
prayer rug. If "Smitty” doesn’t
forgive and forget, he has threat-
ened to go out and drink a full
glass of Crinnell water.
And, to illustrate the more ainus—
ing side of life, the sudden hrcak
in the Lame, Conard deal proved
to be less advantageous for Lainey
than he had evidently planned:
Behold the solidity of tho bond
between Bi-idghnm andlvilkinson,

Now, as to the matter of Victory
Day: After the exhibition given
by the Dibble egomaniacs, (“We’re
the very best of all"), in trying
to crash the local cinema, and
making the pep rally a series of
Dribble Hall yells, the rest of the
campus is wondering why the
dorms don't end at Clark.

i r ,, s

And, speaking of Clark, the home
of Herr Shelton, let’s doff the
Doric skypiece to the fearless
Honor “G" for its daring in quell-
ing the rebellion of the one prep
with the innards to call a graft
a graft. Well done, heroes”
And so Doric closes shop for the
day in order to buy a nostril—
sized clothes~pin to better stand
the White House Four Hundred,
They call it the campus social
set, but we prefer “El stencho
Crande”

ANDERSON RELEASED

Mrs. Flay Anderson, Carney house
cook, who was recently confined
to the Community hospital with a
hand infection, was released Mons

presentation of a valid excuse.
“In order to prepare effective;
ly for participation in the sur-
vey, the student should bc mak-
ing his plans as definitely as pos
sible, and begin as soon as pos-
sible to gather information res
garding his fields of interest."

Job surveys have been held in
Chicago for four years, in Des
Moines twice, and in Minneapolis
oncc. Questionnaires will be ch»
culated at this meeting to actor-
mille student interest in conduct
ing surveys in various cities.

Sophomores and juniors were
included in the Chicago survey
in 1939 for the first time. They
will be allowed to participate in
the surveys of the spring of
1940 bccause of the enthusiasm
and the results last year.
