Plans are under col itierairon iu
the anions ol’ the governing athletic
bodies of C iuuell and Washington
university. for a dual track meet to
he held at st. Louis early in April,
The suggestions are to the cliectthnt
the meet will be lIK‘ltl April lh

This date iutcileres with the Home
meet, but plans can easily be made
[or the postponmllcnt oi the latter
event, In case the meet becomes a
definite fact, the Pioneer track men
will stay in Grinncll during the spring

recess iii order that the men may he,

in the best possible condition ior the
meet.

Washington, although not boasting:
a particularly brilliant array of cine
der stars, possesses a number or men
who are particularly able in their
indiridual events. and a well balanced
team from a school the size of the St.
Louis institution is not particularly
difficult to attain.

Coach Duke will in all probabil' 3
take a full quota of about twenty men
to the meet in order to have two men
in each event. This should enable
the Pioneer team to score tuirly hell’
in most events

To the Editors at tho Scallet and

generously toigrvrng the tar not
answering your letters:

But I do think of you, you know, as
,ihc curtain goes up night filter night

atr s whose mach», we felt as we

rcrrrhrnbcrhr you in holy, perhaps huv

crowded necks ot preparation tor
“name and Juliet," with the tencing
rolls in the corner, the model sets in
construction, and many or you around
iand onitlie tallles as we debated
how best to make the high school
‘stags resemble the interior nt Capllr
let’s mansion.

To talk theatre in a letter, however,
is impossible tor 1 am now so full or
theatre that IL would be fatal to uni
cor-k llleiif I may use so nnseholarly
a phrase. To write or the gallant
abbey group, of opera in Stockholm,
oi the [airy talc plays in Dresden: to
even touch Moscow art, or Meier»
lrcldt's daring revolutionary stage; to
Reinhardt's theatre, or the experi-
‘meuts in Prague and Rigaially one
‘ol these would turn this issu‘c ol the
Scarlet and Black into a bully corn-
nieiicement number.

So I must content ml'selt with send
in: gifts, a few that I have longed to
share with yell. A row of Norwegian
pines marching across the sky, and
the harbor of little ships at Oslo; an
etching of Stockholm, a White city

_ go on to Rome until’tomori‘ow so you

looking proudly out orcr the Baltic:
a ride in a jaunting car down Dublin
way, and a bit 0’ bargaining at a pig
illulket in county Cork, 1 scnd, it the

to the strains ol "Arise, Arise, Arise

You must have nlso a white night in
Leningrad with the Mohammedan
mosque unbelievably gold against the
snow that stretches away past the lie
sorted winter palace to the lions
guarding the entrance to the Finnish
Bay. For good measure n V .nncsc
dusk with lights beginning to gleam
in the coftcc houses; and a few
trains of gypsy music from c cellar

For those oi you in mood romantic

I should like to include a sunrise
over the Forum, {or that would give
it proper academic flavor, but I don’t

shall add, instead, remembrance, not
a collective but a sharply individual-
Izetl remembrance, and —my devoted

In the wiridup of today’s indoor
baseball bill the Clark hall team plays
Dihble tor the iiitiaunlrdl supremacy
in the diamond sport. ('lar last
year‘s champs has Joui'lleyed through
the series without a loss to date, a~
has Dibble. These two teams, meet-
ing in the deciding game of the ser~
ies, have duplicated their play of last
season, when the last game ol the ser-
ies, the Six Five battle, was the ruby
her for the championship.

Both teams stack up with about
equal strength in all departments,
with a slight advantage going to the
courthouse boys’ iniield, which has
proven a stonewall to all ohposing
hitters, so for. Clark has a brace of
line pitchers in Davis and Manager
.Vleeter, and in Conant, Clark boasts,
perhaps, the Babe Ruth of the circuit.
Behind the bat, Eddie Brown. Dibble
backstop, is about the class of the
league, and Lamb has been crack-
Droof on the pitching hill.

The deciding feature of the game
lays. no doubt. in the manner which
either team hits the ball. Both teams
have shown a'tendency to be m in
the clouting line, but today's battle is
Probably coaxing the best ball in each
team to the surface.

In a Well played game Thursday.
Clark marched into a tie for first
place with Dibble, by cutrunning the
Langan team to a. 1076 Victory. Al-
though eurly in the game when Meets
ei- showed signs of wildness, the Clark
team appeared second best in the
match, heavy hitting by the champs
brought the tide of the game around,
and "Sonny” Davis linished Meeter's
task by hurling his team to a fine
win.
