Anti-hate investigation expands

liv DAVID LOGAN

On March 12, according to the Grinnell Police Department,
a second set of letters with anti-queer slurs were mailed to 22 stu-
dents through Grinnell College Mail Services. Thar same day,
some of those students received an crmail with antirqueer states
mcnts which also referenced some ofletters mailed earlier. All of
those students who received 'rl letter had also been mailed a letter
in a similar incident in February when 34 members of the college’s
queer community received letters with anti-queer statements.

on Tuesday, College President Russell K, Osgood and Special
Assistant to the President for Diversity and Achievement Elena
Bernal '94 sent an allecampus ermail informing the larger commu-
nity of both the ennmls and the second set of lettersThe message
emphasized the importance of understanding and empathy, urging
community members to start a constructive dialogue to help in ilre
healing process.

Since the ﬁrst incident, the Grinuell Police Dcpartment has
also enlisted the services of both the Federal Bureau of InVCSil’
garion and the State oflowa Division of Criminal Investigation
which typically have more investigative resourccs

The second set of letters was first discovered by a worker in
the college's mallloom who, because the letters appeared similar to
those mailed in Febnlary,immcdlntclycontacted Grinneli campus
security. Campus securitydeeidcd that the letters \vcu: potentially
con uected to the ﬁrst set twin-railings and callcd the Grinncll Police
Department. which arrived and seized the letters as evidence,

Chris Wray, the police depaitmcnts lead investigator on
the case, said that he considered the letters important pieces of
evidence for the investigation that needed to be controlled. "In a
criminal investigation, we have the power to seize eriderice," said
Wray. "So in this case,l instnicred college security personnel to
seize that pursuant to our investigation."

Because the letters in question were not sent using the United
States Postal Semce, Wray said their privacy was not protected
under federal law. “We did check with the United States Postal

Service,”st \Nray.“Had it fallen as omclﬂl United States mail, we
would have also contacted and gotten involved a postal investigar
tor to assist in this as well."

one thirdeyear student who was targeted in all three incidents
and therefore granted anonymity by the 8&5, said that while they
recognized that the seizure of the letters was “not illegal,” said they
felt it was ”questionable morally."

Wray said that part of the reason for conﬁscating the letters
beyond theirvalric as evidence nas to ensure that they did not cone
min speciﬁc information or threats about potential future acts.

“We seized the letters and examined the letters to make srrie
that there was not some sort oretccutivc message in the letters,"
Wray said. “Thars why it was critical tor us to get those letters
scizcd as quick as we can, to make sure there's not something we
need to act on immediately."

Upon examination of the letters, the Police Department con,
chided that the contentwas srrnilar to that of the ﬁrst mailings and
that they did characterize immediate, actionable threats against
the recipients.

Bei'nal said that adminr- - tors are provided with only limited
information about the invc igitioii and that it was ottcn neces»
sary to withhold information irdisclosiiig it would jeopardize the
investigation,

But some victims, while recognizing the investigations need
to control information, also said they wcle frustrated by an ape
parent lack of openness from those in charge of the investigation.
A senior, wiio was also sent all three messages, said they thought
the investigation was not paying enough attei ion to its human
ClCanL “Thcrc wa n guidance or iriforr ation which was sort
of rursttating. That just something that kept coming up in the
meeting,” they said. "I mostly would have just liked updates like
‘Hey, the DCI has been called, or ‘now the FBI is involved.”

The thirdtyeiu said that they thought the college and police
were putting the investigation above the victims' wishes. “I see a

Pub problems

Debt and sales ratios raise concern
by Karl E MCMULLEN 8c MATT ZMUDKA

Opening a new business can be a struggle. startrup costs,
unfamiliar markets and untested orga ization strategies are just
a few otrhe challenges new business owners race. in its ﬁrst set
rncsrcr oiopetation, Lylc's Prrb is no exception.

Two months into its existence, L, ”s pub already races seri-
ous issues concerning sales ratios, iinaneial solvency and manage-
ment communication Partially in response, the Pub Board of
Directors has begun to derinc its oversight role,

one otrhe biggcst challenges pressing the pubs management
is the city sales ratio requirement, which states that a bar or res—
taurant's revenue must come from at least so percent non-alco-
hol sales in order to allow access to people under 21. “The pub
is struggling to meet that requirement,"said Jeff smiclt'o9, Pub
Board Inembcr.“People are buying more alcohol than food."

According to Controller Nancy Combs, Accounting, sales at
Lylc's are 67 percent alcohol and 33 percent nonalcoholic items
since its Feb. 22 opening

Perhaps due to its recent start-rip, Lyle's seems to have been
given some leeway on the issue of the quota “[Tlrc city] hasn't
been giving us a too or pressure by any means," said Assistant
Manager iordan Lee '08.

But while there may be little pressure, the city still moni-

Mental Health Services
will undergo changes

BY EMMA ROLLER

In November, Student Affairs proposed a Mental Health Set».
vices review in response to student requests alter a student pub-
Licly criticized her treatment. An ad-hoc group was formed and,
while writing review trom outside the college, proposed changes
on Tuesday, April 22,

The committee has also opened up the issue to the campus in
the term otcommunitywrde discussions. At one such discussion
on April 22, students and faculty reﬂected on the accessibility and
approachabiiity of such services to the student body in response
to last semester’s incident.

“We still equate mental health with the most severe mental
problems...it’s assumed that ifyou go to counseling, you must be
crazy," said Stern, adding that often “Grinnellians don’t want to
admit weakness."

Many blamed Mental Health Service’s negative image on
poor communication with the general snrdciit body. “Mental
Health Services has a PR problem," said Mental Health Com-
mittee member Caitlin Vaughan'lo.

In order to reduce hesitance among potential patients, Dean
for Academic support and Advising joyce Stein ’91 said in an
interview, “We need to help students have abetter understanding
ofwhat services are offered"

Brandon Davis, director of the Powcshick County Mental
Health Center since December. has also been working with the
college in hiring a mental health liaison bctncen the center in
town and the campus Health Center. Although the college has
contracted the services of the Mental Health Center for over 30
years, this will be the first time an employee will be working or
clusivcly with Grinnell students

An incrcdsc communication may entail better advert ing of
both ditcct and indirect services offered. Although SCI‘VlCCS such
as the eight free walkriu visits at the Mental Hcalth Ccntcr are
readily advertised during New Student Orientation, less tangir

Davis is more than familiar with students' hesitance to get
help on the basis of not wanting their information shared with the
college. “That's d1: bcnclit ofhaving the Mental Health Center
