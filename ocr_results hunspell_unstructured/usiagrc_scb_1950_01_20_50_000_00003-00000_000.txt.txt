BB Squad Ito Square Off Bonfemps 57.

Against Carls Sat. Night "

Grinnell will be shooting for
a 500 conference record Satur-
day as the Pioneers take ,on
Carleton at 7:30 in Darby gym.
Currently holding down third
place in the conference stand-
ings, the Carls have lost only
to Beloit in league play.

“Saturday‘s game against
Carleton is a ‘must win’ if we
are to pull ourselves up in the
conference race,” said John
Pfitsch. “Carleton is one or the
strongest teams in the league
with a 3—1 conference record,
but our own team morale is the
highest of the year. and we are
determined to take this game.”

Similar Offense

The Carls, who use much the
same type of offense as Grin-
nen, have been sparked this
year by Frank Schiaffer. Last
year Schlaffer set a new school
record as he scored 317 points,

lettermen. Pioneer fans who
saw last year's Carleton game
may remember Charles March,
a guard whose long shots couldr

the team s second highest scorer.

Next Saturday the Pioneers
take the road again for a game
against Knox, currently tied
with Coe for last place with
four conference losses and no
wins. -
