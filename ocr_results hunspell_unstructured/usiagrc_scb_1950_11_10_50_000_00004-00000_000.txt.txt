Two boys named Keck and
Carr plus costly tumble: at the
wrong times added up to Hank
Brown’s gridsters fourth defeat.
Five Critical fumbles helped
Cornell edge the Pioneers 2042
at the Rams‘ Homecoming last
Saturday afternoon.

The first of the Pioneers’ five
hobbles gave Cornell the ball on
the Scarlet and Black 35-yard
stripe. The Rams quickly took
advantage of this miscue, and
on the first play a Keck pitch-
out to Carr was good for six
points. The conversion was good,
and Cornell led To.

Not to be outdone the Pio-
neers tried the same stunt, and
a few plays later “Skip" King—
ery took a pitchout and broke
loose for a 75—yard scamper.

In the opening minutes of the
third quarter, Grinnell set up
the second Ram counter by
fumbling on their 15-yard line.
A Keck to Eakes throw racked
up the touchdown. Late in this
same period Keck again flipped
Carr a toss good for the Ram’s
last TD of the afternoon,

quite tell the whole story, how-
ever.

As usual, Brett Taylor was far
and away the Scarlet and
Black’s outstanding man. Brett
snapped the tape ahead of the
rest of the field in a very cred.
