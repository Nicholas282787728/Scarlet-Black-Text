added that Leichtling's student
evaluations “were not the world's
greatest evaluations.”

Many students, however,
disagree with this statement,
Junior music major Kevin Zocrnig
stated, “Everyone that I knew who
was w 'king with him respected
him as a teacher.” Senior music
major Kurt Anderson, EPC
chairman. points to the result oi
last year's student evaluations as

Evaluations were primarily
positive' 29 of 33 students

his courses were organized and
systematic. 22 out of 26 felt the
amount oi flexibility was suitable,
and only two out oi 32 felt he was
not available enough

HE WAS FAULTED on his lack
oilermal organization, tendency to
ramble, and lack of feedback, but
he was praised for his knowledge oi
the Subject, enthusiasm, ability to
stimulate students, and creativity.
The EFC concluded that, “Alan
Leichtling‘s expertise. experience,
insight and enthusiasm make him
a valuable member of the music
department faculty. We would
like to recommen that Mr.
Leichtling’s contract be renewed,

but we strongly lee] that attention
should be given to tsomel
problems,"

Based on the apparently
favorable review by Leichtling's
students and the Executlve
Council's stress on Indirect
eolleagual evaluations, many
Students believe that Leichtling’s
dismissal was due to conflicts
within the music department
Zoernig is angered over the

adds that the experimental nature
or electronic music is in keeping

Leichtling into one of the best

professors in the music depart-

Cloud's position is only temporary,
however, until a fullrscale Search

students believe. is not the quality

Zoernig charged. “1 want people to
