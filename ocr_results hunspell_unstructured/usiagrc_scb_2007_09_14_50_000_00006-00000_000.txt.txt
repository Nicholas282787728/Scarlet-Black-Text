Mural for hospital-like Hallway

BY LINN DAVIS

It's been compared to “an insane asylum,” “a hos»
pital ward,” “a great void." Even Vice President of
Student Services Tom Crady calls it "sterile." Studio
Art majorThornas Agran ’09 sees an opportunity.

Student Affairs, SGA and student artists want
to cover the bleak walls with murals by current
Grrnnellians and fill the empty glass cases with Ct?
ramics, sculpture and other displays. Agran wants to
be one ofihc mural artists

“Tliars the \ViIV it is with architecture," said As-
sociate Dean for Student Life Michael Sims the ad-
minrstmtor overseeing the project. “[Thc architects]
want the nice white walls so they can tnkc their prcr
turcs, but then we take it over and students do their
thing."

Agran’s design consists ora ﬂowing ﬂeck ofszcne
ciled starlings, morphing from individual birds to an
unidentiﬁable, dark mass as they ﬂy along the halls
way.

Student Services Coordinator Kirby Ramstad '08,
who is managing SGA’s role in the project, said she
hopes to finalize artist choices by fall break and sec
at least our: completed mural on the walls by the end
orthe semester, Whether funding for the project will
come from SGA or Student Affairs is undecided.

How much inﬂuence the administration will wield
over aitists'proposed ideas is yet to be seen. but Sims
said he preferred that the murals “reflect the Griunell

cxpelicncel” He has yet to see Agraii's design.

The idea tor Agran's mural design came from an
April 2007 chu not Twirl Magaziilc article, which
described ﬂocks of starhngs both as scientiﬂeally
useful for studying human herding behavior and as
purely organic terms. En nrassc, the small birds swoop
ﬂuidly like schools of fish and “shimmer" in collective
reaction to stimuli

Agran said he hopes students and administra-
tors Will be enthusiastic about instilling homegrown
art elsewhere on campus as rvcll, oven in places that
wouldn't usually be considered artistic venues.

Last year, for cxlil'nplc, Agran stencrled a swarm
of“flocking bananas" on the floor of the Bucksbauni
painting studio, and he has orrcn looked at the build
rugs loading dock and at campus sidewalks as grcrrt
art spaces.

For his part, Agran has negotiated mural subjects
before. While in high school in Cincinnati, Ohio, lo
cal leaders asked him to paint a cindcrblock wall in i!
neighborhood park “I brought a whole ton ordcsigns
to them, and they rejected all of them," said Agran.
“They wanted me to paint something patriotic—the
state seal of Ohio."Agran's flock of birds will bring
a different feel to the third floor, albeit loss patriotic.
But at the very lcnst, the painted walls won't emulate
any insane usylurns.

ral design, contact [service].

KDIC (fingers-crossed)
to launch this Monday

lir PAUL CAKLSON 8L
Au SARGENT

After FCC battles,
equipment railurc, unrcr
liable DJS and a whole
lot of dead air, campus
radio station KDIC
has high hopes for this
week. Those impossible
dreams: they plan to
begin broadcasting on
Monday, sept. 17.

Fall semester of last
year it did not broadcast
at all, following up with
only limited play time

“laslyear really/sucked and it ,0
wasn’t really under our control.”

in the Spring. Problems
began last year during
the process of moving
the KDIC studio from
Younker Fit to the Joe
Rosenfield ’25 Celi-
ter. A brand new studio
was useless with a bros
ken transmission cable.
And then it took three
months to get an eligi-
ncer to ﬁx it.

“Last year really
sucked and it wasn't res

ally under our control,“

sriid KDIC herid Daniel
Furuta ’08. He insisted
that all of
the technical
problems that
the station cx-
pcricnccd last
year have since
been fixed.

tion to the iiicdillni.“lr's
cool that I have the op
portunity to play music
I like,” she said. “It's rce
ally cool to go back home
and tell my friends ‘yeah,
I've had a radio show for
three years.”

Students who apply
for broadcast time gm,
erate the programming.
In the past, KDIC has
featured a fair amount of
rock and hip~hop shows,
but the rest have been
terried, ranging from
a Broadway
musical show
late—night
erotica. There
have been sigr
nif‘icanr omist
sions though.
“I wish we had
a legit punk rock show,"
Furuta said

This year the radio
station intends to broad-
cast live 8 a.m.—2 a.m.,
filling the airtime with
student shows nyoethrce
hours long, with an aur
tomated music selec—
tor playing the rest of
the time. Programs for
this semester include a
possible interview with
Demociatic presidential
contender Senator Chris
Dodd,

actually be listening.>
Hopefully the stair isn't
representative of schools
widc trends. Furuta does
not listen to the radio;
Iwuc doesn’t even own
one.

Campus sentiment
runs the gamut from
apathy to anticipation.
“I listened to [KDIC]
once," said Willie Stew:
art '08. “And it was only
because it was one ofmy
friends’ shows."

Still, hopes remain
high for the future. “I
think it would be really
nice if [KDIC listeners
ship] was up this year,”
said Emily Jacobson ’09.
“I think it’s a really great
venue to talk, play music,
whatever."

KDIC broadcasts at
88.5 FM.

50 will campus
be rocking out
to the sweet
soundsofKDlC
this year? Or
will we have to
endure anoth-

dead air? Tune

this Monday to

then check out
the 5&3 next
