New exhibitions to examine the body

EVTORKEVMACGREGOR

Last weeks Love Yo oIII Body selies of
events might have leached It belated climax
II week after then conclusion IvIth the opens
ing reception this afternoon at 4: 15 pm. fol
the new exhlhitions “Body/Image" and "Ukur
cwebezela: To Shine.” Both exhibitions will be
shown In the Gallely until Dec. 14, and both
represent the body III unique ways: the former
with photoglaphs, drawings and paintings that
explore the human bodyipartlculitrly In a sat
cial context—and the latteI with highly com,
pies examples ot’what the body can create.

The exhibition "Body/Image” is curated by
Dan Strong, who has served as assocIatc dis
rector of Faulconer Gallery since 1999. The
exhibition incorporates pieces housed in the
College’s collection, from which he selected
the work of 16 artists whose work focuses on
the human body

“The theme of this [exhibition] Is figura-
rive," he said. “A lot of the things we've collects
ed are about the body and images of the body
in a lot of different formats, a lot of different
media, and I just thought this is an ideal tIme
to bring them all together."

Many of the pieces in Strong's exhibition
are works on paper, and while the pIeces were
created through diverse artistic methods, such
as paintings, pencil drawings, and collages
from cutouts in photographs and magazines,
there are no sculptures or thrccrdimcnsional
works of art on dIsplay. Strong explained that
thIs focus happened simply because works on
paper are what the college’s collection is com-
posed of.

Kay Wilson, curator of Griuncll College's
permanent collection, said that the college's
focus on acquiring art on paper may have
originated because historically, artists have
chosen to create works on paper as a means of
proselytizingi works on paper can be mass-
distributed and can reach a wider audience,
Strong saw such an emphasis as inﬂuencing
the exhibition in general. “We collect images
that suit the history of the college— social
resistance, political movements,” he said. “We
tend to that kind of art that makes some kind
of a social statement or political statement."

“Ukucwehezclat To Shine" began with a
different purpose, curated by Elizabeth Pei”
rill‘99, the exhibition showcases contemporary
2qu ceramIcs. Three pieces were taken from
the college's collection, and Perrill acquired the
rest in the last 10 years.

Perrill’s interest in African art began dur
ing her time as a student at Grinnell. For a
SOC-level art class, she researched a few pieces
from West Africa, and though her Interest has
shifted from one African region to another, she

hopes that her exhibition will help to complete
the college's collection of African art. With
her exhibition of“some ofthe best examples of
Zulu ceramIcs," she hopes that more emphasis
will be placed on threerdimensional art in the
future.

Both Strong and Wilson hope that the
more contemporary nature combined with the
social commentary present in these two exhi-
bitions Will attract many students. Previous ext
hibitions with these two aspects together, such

as Roger ShInromuta’s, have been popular with
students. “I went to the Roger Shimomura exr
hibition. It was really interesting; I brought my
friends to go see it," says James Ng '12.

Other students hope that this exhibition
will offer something different. "I went to the
Shimomura one, too, but I didn't really like it,"
said Paul Leger '12. “I’m planning to go to the
one wIth the zulu ceramics, though, that looks
cool."

BY CHARLES NETZER

With the addition of a new practice space
and some extra funds, Freesound, the campus
bands collective, has never been stronger. it's
set to prove just how much stronger it is with
{our concerts (in which 22 bands are set to
play) over two and a half weeks, startIng to-
night in Gardner.

The “Music Still Hates You" festival will
incorporate a number of musical genres into
the larger concert scheme. The festIval will

workday style party hypothetically
runs from 9 pm. to 5 a.m., hence
the name

“Seriously, don't come if
you're lazy," Farstad warned. “Djs
K, NerFace and Fancy Mike will
spin into the wee hours."

The festival pauses until the
next Friday, and then kicks into
lIIgb gear. The punk show on I
Nov 21 begins with a handout of ,
posters and trshirts in (hind for '
those who get to the show early

"We had alumni David Bar— :

off. “We call the show ‘The
COrOptation of counter Cul-

The sweaty masses can take

although Farstad admitted that
the festival doesn't technically
end. “People gotta sleep," he
said. “But you can stay."

“This festival has been several 'weeks in
the making," Ho said. “All the same, we still
need voluIIteeIs to help make sure things go
smoothly.”

Students were impressed at the scope of the
event and looked forward to attending. “I’m so
excited," said Clare Comstock '09, “this is go-
ing to be the best Grinnell show ofall timcl"
