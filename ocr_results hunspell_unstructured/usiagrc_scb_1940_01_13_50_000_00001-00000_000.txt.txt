Applicants for Football Coach Have Not Been Cut—- Wood;

Douglas, Crimsley, McClain Appear as Favored on Campus

 

By William Buckley.

The five-man committee ap—
pointed by the board of trustees
to select a new football coach to
replace Guy H. Lookabaugh, who
resigned Dec. 15. has taken no
action as yet on the appointment
of a new grid mentor. according
to Paul Spencer Wood, a mem—
ber of the group.

This statement will probably
bring to an end the rumors float-
ing about the campus to the ef-
fect that the committee has nat-
rowed the field of possible candi—
dates dowh to five men. The
rumor received considerable pub—

 

licity in~the Des Moincs Tribune
last night.

Wood, who estimated that over
100 applications have been re-
ceived for the post, said that the
committee would not meet until
President John s. Nollen and Fred
A. Little, member of the board of
trustees, had returned from the
East.

Little is on the committee ap-
pointcd by the hoard of trustees
to select the ncw grid mentor,

Ben Douglas, Maplewood, Mo,
prep coach, and rumored leading

candidate for the job, being hath

a successful high school coach
and Gl'ilinell graduate, would be
given serious consideration for
the position, according to Wood.
Douglas is alleged to have said
that he will not apply for the
job, but would takc it if it is of-
fel'ed to him.

other strong candidates for the
post are rumored to be Arden
McClain, football coach at North
high in Des Moincs, and Judge
Grimslcy, coach at Mason City
high school and Junior college.

The new football coach will be
selected in time for spring foot-
ball practice, Wood declared.
