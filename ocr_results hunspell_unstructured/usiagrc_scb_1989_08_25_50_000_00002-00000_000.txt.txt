The Nanjing Exchange
Lives

At a time when many American schools are pulling out of
Chinaout of fear and a thirst forretribution, Grinnell ’3 admin-
istrators deserve credit for their coolehcaded decision to keep
the college involved in two study—abroad programs in Nanj in g.

In ugly contrast, the National Academy of Sciences in
June suspended its three major exchange programs with
China to protest China’s crackdown on pro-democracy dem»
onstrators i a suspension that affects about 200 prominent
Chinese and American scholars.

That kind of academic demagoguery is founded on the
arrogant assumption that China alone will suffer from a cutoff
of academic ties. Go ahead, China, make our day, says the
National Academy of Sciences. It’s your [055.

That ignores the contributions Chinese scientists have
made toward technology here at home. Through scholar ex,
change programs, Americans have learned lately about innoi
vative drugs effective in fighting AIDS and cancer, and about
a plant-immunization process that has saved thousands of
acres of Chinese cropsi American researchers in China have
been using the silkworm as a tool in genetic experiments, have
been studying erosion and the spreadof deserts andhave lately
been able to examine the Communist Party in great detail,
gaining insights into a mysterious political world. A Chinese
graduate student working in the US. even discovered a new
material that can be used in high-temperature superconduc—
tors.

Good for Grinnell, to turn its back on the self-righteous
posturing that’s bringing down more and more academic ex-
changes, and to allow its own students to decide whether to
make the trip to Nanjing.

Seems that the National Academy of Sciences and all the
other academics indignantly pulling out of the People’s Rea
public need a reminder about exactly who else in China will
suffer from an academic drain: Chinese students, the people
who engineered the uprising in the ﬁrst place, the very people
whom theNational Academy of Sciences says it holds so dear.
