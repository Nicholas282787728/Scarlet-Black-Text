at SGA

To the Editor:

Last week's hassle over the
referendum and alleged pro
pogztnda is symptomatic of a deep
diviston here at Grinncll. The cone
scrvatlvc elite are at odds wlth the
incoming SGA . dmlnistration.

One elite ' uses the other of
proposed tyranny while others ctrr
culatc secret lcttcrs proposing to
discredit appointees on the basis
or subjective character
assessments. For those olyou who
are confused. I'll explain.

One group or people fears
another group's values. Both
groups want SGA as their forum.
What is so upsetting is that all this
behavior is based on fears of what
will happen. not what has in tact
already occurred. Fears of overly
political behavior is not confirmed
by the record, out of four propOSr
ed occasions for letter-writing or
resolutions. only one tLhe Solomon
Amendment Controversy) was
passed,

There are many problems and
issues facing SGA and the campus
that must be addressed in the
coming year. How can these pro
blems be addressed it both sides

everyone to act like adults and

Hands off media money

It‘s nearing Finals Week again, and we re all busy stu-
dying. Joint Board is also heading into Finals Week, and
they’re taking care of last minute details. Unfortunately,
it seems as though one of the details was passing a reduc—
ed budget for the Grinnell media.

To put it bluntly, this action is unacceptable. When the
power of the media (and money, dear readers, is power)
is vested in the hands of a governing body and not in the
hands of the media, there is plenty of room for bad things
to happen.

Not only does having control of our funds take away our
autonomy, but it smacks of censorship as well. How ironic
that the body that supposedly represents the students is
choosing to help muzzle the outlets through which
students’ views are expressed.

At a time when the SGA budget is getting an addition of
approximatley $6,000, there is no logicial reason to cut
media budgets. If there were a genuine fiscal crisis facing
SGA, then cutting budgets is understandable, But there is
no fiscal crisis and there is no need to exert a monetary
chockhold on us.

It is time that the campus media had control over their
own fiscal destiny. We hear complaints from our student
“leaders’ that the media can ’t handle their own money
and SGA' is tired of bailing us out Well we re tired of hav-
ing to report to SGA for funding and only getting it after
hearing how we do not spend it wisely.

There isn’t a single person on Joint Board with the ex-
pertise to tell any of the media how and where to spend

money. Further, the media operations are controlled b
the Student Publications and Radio Committee,
Presidential committee theoretically unrestricted
SGA. Until there is a separate media fund establishe
SGA should pass along the money mat the media nee
and let let SP and R worry about its control.

It is sad that the last editorial of the year is one th
criticizes the SGA. But it is even sadder that the autono
and power of the media is being undermined by th
group.

Time for a definite policy

Next Spring, Mary Jane Constant probably will not be
playing baseball but hopefully by that time the Athletic
Department will have finally come up with a satisfactory
statement about the roster cutting powers of its coaches.

Constant has done the College the favor of bringing to
the floor an issue laden with ambiguity but until now has
not been dealt with, although it should have been resolved

. years ago.

The question' 15: Should the coaches at Grinnell College,
a private institution which participates on the Division 111
level of the NCAA be allowed to cut players from their
squads and if so, how far should this power extend'.7

Executive Vice-President Waldo Walker claims that the
College has always followed the policy of allowing the
coaches the use of their own discretion, while those on the

' other side of the fence have said that Grinnell has always
had the policy that anyone should be allowed to go out for
any sport as part of their total “Grinnell experience," and
their liberal education.

Neither “policy” has every been stated in writing, yet it
is doubtful if this College is so structured that everything

can operate onward of mouth and good faith.

When this long awaited policy statement is final]
drafted, it should reflect a balance between the integrit
of the coaching positions while not infringing upon t
rights of the students who not only are. adults but pa
money to go here

For a team to function as a unit, the coach has to be i
charge, not only if that team .is to win but if the e
perience, win or loose, is to be positive. The Coach must c
free to emphasize the positive learning experience t
working together as a team. Or, the coach should be ab
to just foster a fun atmosphere

The question of skill should be left up to the coache
hoping that cuts be made for the safety of the athlet
and/or team members.

On the other hand, anyone 7 male of female — if the
are no regulations against their participation in a spur
should feel free to go out for that sport without the wor
that their sex or color or religion will bias the coach of t
pertinent team against them. And, if the other players fe
their presence is disruptive: tough.

In our struggle to progress
toward peace the male-only
registration is still unjust. It plac-
es an unfair burden for the price
or peace on young men. who.
unlike others, face threats of im~
prisonment and criminal status
unless they comply with
draft/registration. Women. and
other exempt groups. are ar-
tifically protected

We who are not directly attecled
by dralt/registration must refuse
