Crowley’s Art Goes
On the Road this Fall

Tony Crowley, assistant profes-
sor of art at Grinnell, will exhibit
work at galleries in Tennessee and
Wisconsin this fall.

Several of Crowley’s large draw-
ings will be on display from Sept. 25
to on. 16 at the Trahem Gallery on
the campus of Austin Fwy State
University in Clarksville, Tenn.
Crowley will also serve as Austin
Péay’s artist-in-residenee at the uni-
versity's Center for Creative Arts
from Oct. 16 to 20, conducting
workshops in studio processes and
ancn'ticism, and creatinga new large
drawing, to measure 80 inches by
120 inches.

From Oct. 9 through Nov. 5,
Crowley’s monotypes and drawings
will be on display at Lakeland Col-
lege in Sheboygan, Wise.

Crowley says he uses music and

poetry as sources for his drawings,
prints and paintings in the same way
that other artists use a still life or a
landscape. The images that result
from his use of this process, called
synaesthesia, are abstract —— a com-
plex overlapping and stacking of
geometric and organic shapes. Col-
ors and textures are greatly varied in
die works, and are always strongly
influenced by the poem or song so
leeted as the source.

Crowleyjoined the Grinnell Col-
lege faculty in August 1989, after
teaching for 10 years at Tarkio Col-
lege in Missouri and sewing as a
graduate assistant at the University
of Nebraska.

He has served as a visiting artistat
several institutions and has had more
than 25 exhibitions ofhis work since
1986.

Exhibit Offers Rare Glimpse of
College’s African Art Collection

 

By Bill Thompson

Like the continent itself, the art of
Africa is a fascinating and complex
subject to study. Thanks to the gen-
erous donationsof numerous alumni
and collectors, the college is blessed
with an extensive collection of Afri-
can works, which unfortunately
spend a lot of time in storage be-
cause of the absence of a suitable
gallery on campus.

However, a small but excellent
sarnpleis now on display in the lobby
of the Fine Arts Building. The ex-
hibit, “West-and-Central African
Art," is mostly comprised of tribal
sculpture but includes a variety of
smaller objects worthy of recognir
tion, including pieces of woven cloth,
a headrest, pendant, drinking cup
and cosmetic box.

Althoughtheindividualartistsand
precise dates of the works are often
unknown. African art still provides a
unique insight into the different
cultures and values of the many

African tribes. Onc intriguing arti-
fact in the exhibit is the “Standing
Female Ancestor Figure” of the
Bamama People of Mali, which
demonstrates not only a reverence
for the past but also the imponance
of women and religion in their sociv
ety. Another notable work is the
ritual “Initiation Mask" of the Yaka
People of Zaire.

The Bchnical achievementof these
artists was obviously great; works
have been rendered in mediums
ranging from blackened wood, reed
fibers and pigment to forged iron
and bronze. One work in particular
~ the bronze sculpture “Standing
Female Figure with Baby and Child“
of the Fon People of Dahomey ~ is

a remarkable artistic and technical
accomplishment.

“Primitive” may be an inapproprie
ate word to use when labeling Afri~
can art; aside from the brilliant craft-
ing skill and technique these artists
obviously had, the distorted forms
and abstract style so typical of con-
temporary art developed in Africa
long before it became prevalent in
Europe.

Art professor Richard Cervene
selected works for the exhibit from
the hundreds of African artifacts in
the college’s permanent collection.
The works are on display through
Oct. l3 and complement study in
Cervene’s freshman tutorial, which
deals with African art. Later in the
semester,studean in the tutorial will
select additional works of art for a
second phase of the exhibit. A more
permanent display of African art is
found near the Black Library on the
second ﬂoor of Burling Library, and
the college archives contain cata-
logues of recent acquisitions.

you as you pick up your papers, so
we’ll just use words anyway.

Tammy, the ﬁrstofthe Who’s two
rockeoperas, is the story of a wee lad
who’s father was missing in action
in World War 11.

Years later, his father reappears
and is killed by his mother‘s boy-

 

friend, who overreacts to this some
what uncomfortable social situation.

This comedy of manners contin-
ues when Tommy’s mother tells him
that he never saw or heard or should
speak about the murder. As a result.
Tommy grows up deaf, dumb and
blind.

But on the other hand. he sure
plays a mean pinball.

Although theWho doesn’t sing all
of the songs, the performances of
such singersasTina Tumerand Elton

John mix surprisingly well with the
band's material,

Jack Nicholson puts in a nice
cameo as a somewhat sleazy spe-
cialist, but perhaps this role would
have been better portrayed by Adam
West.

While the ﬁlm is somewhat un-
even, ifyou likeHair, you’ll likethis
one.

And we like Hair. so on a scale of
one to 13 Eastern philosophies, we
give this onean 11 and a tantn'c sect.

And this Emerald City bears a strik-
ing resemblance to Manhattan.
What‘s going on here? Surely we’re
not in Kansas anymore...

Notcven close. Drawing impetus
from its successful Broadway musi-
cal namesake, The le is a high-
cnergy film displaying such names
as Diana Ross (Dorothy), Richard
Prior (The Wiz) and Lena Horne

(Glinda Good), The Scarecrow is
played by the moonwalker himself,
Michael Jackson.

While it does not have the bril-
liance oftheall-black Broadway hit,
The Wiz does draw somereal strength
from powerful individual perform-
ances,such as thatofMabel King,as
Evillene. Lena Horne offers another
highlightwith herexcellentperform-
ance of “Believe in Yourself."

The ﬁlm’smany musical numbers
include songs by Quincey Jones and
Luther Vandross. A 73~voice adult
choir, which includesRobena Flack,
adds to the film’s musical energy.

The film is worth seeing ifonly to
discoverjust what a “Head Winkie”
is, and to ﬁnd out how a picture
which includes a number called
“Slide Some Oil to Me“ can go unr
rated.
