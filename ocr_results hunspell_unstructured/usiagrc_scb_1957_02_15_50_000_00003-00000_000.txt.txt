Aspirants' Badkérs Tell Views

 

Bob Mclimscy

i am actively backing Bob
Mchmsey for Student Council
president because his platform
and ideas are realistic. The other
candidates have developed a
number of fine sounding rem
ommendations for reorganizing
the world and pleasing special
interests 7 recommendations
thought up in the wee small
hours of the morning to give
them something, anything, to
run on, But the past is strewn
with plans for new constitutions,
two votes for Loose, and the
like—that have sounded good and
won votes 7 but have been un-
realistic and obviously impos-
sible or worthless.

Bob theretore has in all non-
esty refrained from fooling
everyone with pat answers and
simple solutions. He has accept-
ed the harder task of seeking
to convince the students that
desired improvements can only
be brought about by a person
willing to work hard at coord-
inating and streamlining the
present activities of the Coun-
cil. Demanding responsible ac-
tion from the committees, or-
ganizing the Council agenda
and cooperating with the faculty
and administration, are prereq-
uisites for the mature sort of
Council that can effectively rep
resent the students and accom-
plish desired changes and re—
forms.

Plans are worthless if they
can't be carried out. Bob will
first make the Council an effi-
cient and respected organization.
Then and only then will
promises become reality.

Grinnell Arranges
Callech '3-2' Plan

A cooperative engineering Curr
ricuium has been arranged by
Grinnell with California insti-
tute of Technology at Pasadena,
Grant 0. Ga a (physics) announ—
ced this we .

Preliminary arrangements for
the new five~year combined pro-
gram were made by President
Howard R, Bowen and President
Lee DuBridge of Caltech, which
is one of the country's top in-
stitutions for science training.

Known as the “3-2” plan, the~

.cooperative curriculum permits
a student to attend Grinnell
three years, following a pree
scribed curriculum, and then
take two years of additional
study at the affiliated school. At
the end of five years, the stu-
dent satisfactorily completing
the full course will receive his
AB. degree from Grinnell and
a B.S. from the other institu-
tion.

The Caltech arrangement is
the fourth such combined pro-
gram to be arranged by Grinnell.
The others are with Rensselaer
Polytechnic institute, the School
of Engineering at Columbia un-
iversity, and the State Univer-
sity of Iowa.

Tom Skornia

Because a Student Council ciee
tion is morc than a popularity
contest, and because it involves
giving the decision m the Candi-
date with the best insight, abllr
ity and leadership, we are
warmly supporting Toni Skornia
for the presidency of the Stu-
dent Council of Grinnell college.

We believe that Tom possess-
es all these qualities and more,
and can serve with the highest
degree of competence, He has
attained a high scholastic rec»
ord at Grinneli, having been ap-
pointed a Hermit in his freshe
man year and winning the Phi
Beta Kappa book award as a
sophomore.

A heavy course load and work
schedule have combined with a
semester's absence for study in
the nation's capital to prevent
him from receiving appointment
to “high onice," but have not
anectcd his interest nor percep-
tion/ of student needs at Grlne
neii.

A comparison of platforms
will reveal nebulous “philoso-
phies” contrasted with a hard
and speciﬁc course of intended
action. The latter is a result of
Tom's careful consideration of
views expressed to him in meet
ings with dozens of Grinnell
students.

The criteria of a good candir
date should be: an ability to
lead and inspire conﬁdence, a
warm and sympathetic personals
ity and a definite coursc of ac.
tion once he is in onice. it is
obvious that Tom ﬁlls the bill
on all of these. Vote Skornial

SIGN OF GOOD TASTE

 

Sue Berne

A good Student Council presi-
dent is one who recognizes unr
healthy situations before they
have a chance to become serious
problems. Under the system of
student government in Effect at
Grinnell, there are two governs
ing bodies, the League Board
and the Council of House Pres .
dents, who take responsibility
for affairs which are speciﬁcally
within their jurisdiction, for
,matters which are logically
'theirs. They do not seek prob-
lems, but work to alleviate ex-
isting ones.

Matters which affect all stu—
dents, however, are constitution-
ally the jurisdiction of the stu-
dent Councii. A president who
is simply adequate may work
to solve problems which are
brought to him. But a sense of
loyalty to the student body, ac.
tive participation in campus ace
tivities, and initiative are requi—
site for a good president.

1 submit that Sue Berne has
these qualities: understanding,
experience and foresight. Her
concept of student government
is well thought ou it is sound,
it is sensible, it is sympathetic
to the problems and needs of
Grinnell.
