Absentee Vote Method
Explained By Gannaway

“Students who expect to vote in

receiving the official ballot". explain—
ed Prof. J. w. Ganaway in a speech
at chapel Friday morning.

This application should be sub
mitted 20 days prior to the election.

But Thomas Gets Faculty Support

That Herbert Hoover is the presi-
dential candidate favored by the Gri .

place with Norman Thomas a close
third.

ceived 267. The Quadrangle with 130
votes in his favor, over half of the
total number of votes cast by the
girls, gave him tho greatest support,
while the Dormitories conceded him
112. Three of the ltousemotncrs
selected him as the ideal candidate.
The faculty gave him 22 of its 55
votes. twice as many as it granted
Roosevelt and the same number as it
gave Thomas.

With 152 votes, 115 less than the

 

number received by Hoover. Roose~
velt won second place.

ported him with 60. The sentiment
of the faculty wits definitely against
Roosevelt. only one fth of its total
number of votes being cast in his
favor. Three of the housemothers al
so gave him their support.

The surprise of the straw vote was
the close race that Norman Thorn
gave Roosevelt. Tho Socialist condi-

Dope Grinnell
to Win First
Valley Game

Gridsters L eave Tomorrow
for Homecoming Tilt

' in St. Louis

Not considered a serious contender
for the 1932 Missouri Valley confer-
ence championship. a sober Grinnell
college football eleven will begin its
series of loop contests eugaging‘
Washington university of st. Louis
Saturday afternoon as the featured
guests of the Beau-5' homecoming
festival.

Dnilre Next

The Pioneers meet Washington.
Drake. Creighton. and the Oklahoma
Aggies in the order named. Creigh~
ton and Oklahoma a, & M. loom as
the strongest contenders, but since
the cowboys defeated the omaha
team last Friday it remains for Grin-
nell alone to stop the Aggies’ drive
for the title, ‘

Conch Watt's men are the favor-
ites to win Saturday afternoon, but
the Washington team should be at
its best before the homecoming
crowd. The scarlet and black eleven
looked none too good against One
Saturday. despite the fact that the
Kohawk team was outplayed at every
turn. A powerful running attack put
the Pioneers in scoring position time
after time, but they showed a decided
lack of a touchdown punch.

Grtnnell Comp Serious

A serious atmosphere has spread
itself through the Grinnell camp this
week and when the Pioneers take the
field Saturday. the lack of drive so
evident in the Coe game should be
entirely done away with.

A squad of about 20 players will
leave herc Thursday evening. not to
return home until Sunday night. In-
cluded in this number will be all the
veterans and practically the same
now men that made the trip to Michi—
gan State. although Singer and St.
John. who were left at home two
weeks ago, will probably go to St.
Louis.

Cioe Holds Pioneers
to Scoreless Tie

Despite the fact that they were
outplayed in every department of the
game. a fighting Coe college eleven
held a strong Grinnell team to a
scoreless tie. last Saturday although
the visitors had no less than half a
dozen chances to score,

Perhaps the reason for Grinnell’s
defeat was the flat failure of its aer-
ial attack, which refused to function
when the Pioneeis came within strik-
ing distance of the goal line. Three
plays before the end of thogamc,
James throw a spot pass to Duncan
over cenL'er which should have been
good for a touchdown. Duncan. sur-
rounded by playcrs. had the slightly
high pass in his hands, but dropped
it.

Ullrich Again Stars

Dick Ullrich. the sparhplug of the
Grinnell attack. continued his splen—
did exhibitions of football skill, and
struck terror into the hearts of Coe
followers with his brilliant work. His
two best efforts were runs of so and
51 yards respectively. although both
times he was stopped short of the
goal line. on one occasion. the Pio~
nccrs marched the ball eighty yards
in three plays with Alexander and
which carrying the ball only to lose
their scoring opportunity

McKee, McMillin. Gould, and Ros-
enhoom played well in the line. James
gave evidence that he had recovered
from his leg injury with several nice
gains in the fourth quarter.
