One of the Best on the Course to be
oiven Friday Evening.

Friday night we will have the
pleasure of listening to probably
as enjoyable a program ever as was
given before a Grinnell audience.
Miss Ida Bentey in her peculiarly
dynamic and vivitying manner
will tell us the story of a great
novel, and Miss Harriet Case will
sing to us sweet songs. Either of
these ladies would be abundantly
able to entertain usin an excellent
manner during an entire evening.
but with the two of them it is cer-
tain there will be delivered one of
the most delightfully satisfying
programs that was ever heard in
this city.

CHRISTMAS FAIR

Second Annual Bazaar to bc Given by the
Young Women's Christian AssoCIar
tion Next Saturday Evening.

One of the events of the [all
term last year winch was most
successful in a social ivay was the
bazaar held by the yoiingwomen's
Christian association. The object
of the bazaar is to raise funds for
Christian association purposes,
but the fair has been found to be
much more than a ﬁnancial sues
cess, as the social side has been
much emphasized. The bazaar
thus serves double purpose. and
has been round a great success in
accomplishing both This year
it is expected that the bazaar will
for eclipsethat oilastyearin every
way. The pieparationstorit have
been going on fortivo months,and
no effort will be spared to make it
one of the important events of the
college year. It is planned to make
the evening of the bazaar one or
tlioro social enjoyment and this is
one of the aims the committee has
in view, besides the erroit to make
it a ﬁnancial success.

Owing to the change in the rlate
for the beginning of the Christ-
rnas vacation, the date foi the
bazaar liasbeeii put a week earlier,
and it will be held next Saturday
evening, December i3, at the
women's gymnasium. No formal
program has been arranged but
the Visitors will be entertained by
music by the band. Every one is
cxpected to be presentand theaf-
fair will be a typical collegesocial
event. The plan of the bazaar
has been outlined in these columns
before and shows that enough
work has been done to insure its
success. Towns people and friends
are welcome to attend the bazaar
and spend an evening of pleasure
atthe women‘sgymnusium, Near-
ly all the women in college have
contributed articles for sale. and
dainty and appropriate Christmas
gifts can be purchased at reason
able prices. This will be the last
general college social event oi the
term. All are welcometo come

It is worthy of mention that
some of the most successful high
school football teams of this and
of neighboring states have been
coached by men who have gained
their football knowledge in Iowa
College.

Inthis state the Grinnell high
school iootball team coached by
T. H. Ziegler, riglitrackle of the
'00 team. has won the undisput—
ed title of Iowa State high school
football champions, defeating the
strong East Des Moines team

also the Davenport team who
held the championship in the
eastern pan of the state lies.

The East Des Moines team
coached by Clyde D.I{ulsizer, '00,
has after Grinnell played the best
football of any high school
in the state. being dcreated only
by college teanistintil the chame
pionship game, During the seas
son they defeated Omaha and the
Lincoln high school team which
held the championship of Nebrase
A recent issue of the Iii-glam

the fact that he has kept in close
touch with Giinnell methods

’Varsity has with scanty material
turned out a team that is a credit
to its school, being termed by
the [mt/r: Nam/ml Illaill/zly, the
oldest school journal in the state,
the "champion light weight
team of the state." They have
played no school of equal weight
and often played against great
odds, the Grinnell team being un-
able to score in the ﬁrst half of
the game against them. They
also defeated the heavy Marshall-
town team in a close game. the
score being 543.

Of the smaller schools Monte-

has had the best team the school
has ever had, holding: Grinncll toa
