Experiments With Various
Combinations to Find

Best Lineup

By FRANK BEATLE

“Best by test" is the slogan which
will fit the particular combination of
Pioneer cageis starting the State
Teachers game at Cedar Falls Monday
evening.

For Coach John C. 'I‘fuesdale has
been working six different combina-
tions of varsity men against freshman
outfits in a series of 10—minute scrime
mages during the last three days, in
order to find his best aggregation.

Lineup Scrambled

In these combinations, the men have
been given a chance to demonstrate
their ability at posiuons other than
the ones which they regularly play,
For instance Julie Bauer, center. has
also been used at guard. Harry Du-
Mont, guard, has been tried at for»
ward; Mickey Frye, forward, at guard,
and Capt. Dick Mason and Hawe
Oliphant at both the forward and cen—
ter positions.

A combination which seems to have
extraordinary speed and basket shoot—
ing ability features Mason and Frye
at forwards, oliphant at Center, and
DuMont and John MdVIbu'ray, guards,

McMurraY only Newcomer

McMurray, who transfered W'Grin-
nell fmm Webster City Junior col—
lege last year, is the only nonrletter
man who has been breaking regulars
ly into the varsity lineup. He has
demonstrated that he Can stand the
pace set by the four veterans and also
has a good percentage on shots.

Coach 'l‘ruesdale has not yet an.
nounced his starting lineup, but it is
probable that it will be selected from
a group of six men—the five above
and Julie Bauer, veteran center.

Fourteen To Make Trip

Fourteen Pioneers will make the
trip, They arc: Capmin Dick Mason,
Mickey Frye, Harve oliphant, Gene
Klepfer, Bill McFarlin, Bill Parry.
bok, Bob Morgan, Julie Bauer, Harry
DuMont John McMui—ray, Bill Fowle
2", Paul McCully, Jim Bradley, and
Ed. Henningsen,

ward, center, and Sampson, forward,

workouts. The former has been eleCL
ed captain of the frosh forces for the

scientist, William Beebe, E. B. T.
Spencer, head of the lecture course
committee, has drawn up a list of re.
gulations which will be observed in
admitting students to the Strand

made it impossible to present the lee,
ture in a larger auditorium, Prof.

Valley Heads
Act on Rules

Football Cards to Include
More Loop Teams

DES MOINES, la. (Special)7A
new deal for Missouri Valley confer—
ence football has been decreed. The
cards are all shuffled, and the game
begins next fall.

Each of the seven conference schools
must play at least three circuit games
according to the ruling passed at the
last December meeting of conference
officials, and this will go imo effect
in the 1935 football season,

The three_game rule is regarded as
only the beginning in the drive to
mould the conference into a compact
unit, producing areprescntativa cham.
pion in each Sport. Since the Mis—
souri Valleyeflig Six split in l927, the
Valley has had difficulty in deciding
a clearcut football champion. This fall
the situation is even more muddled
than usual, with Creighton, Washing
ton and Drake in the running.

Highcr Minimum Erpcctcd

Yesterday and today at Kansas City,
Mo, conference faculty represent—
atives and athletic directors met, and
a decision on a football champion was
expected. it is also likely that the of.
f rals will consider increasing the
minimum number of circuit football
games to four instead of three,

The chief difﬁculty facing the pro—
posal is found at Tulsa and Washburn,

These glands, Dr, Norris explains,

have already been established as the

 

seat of various kinds of development
in humans and animals. it is known
that they influence sex development,
and bodily growth, but except lor-
these fundamental facts not a great
deal is understood about them. it is
due to almonnalities in these glands,
Dr. Norris states, that such monstrosr

Dr. Norris has worked for lo years

to make the cap a mark of distmc'ion
which may bc denied freshmen who
have failing grades

Dean Shelton L, Beatty cooperated‘
with the athlct s in drawing up the
regulations, rding to Harold Ans
