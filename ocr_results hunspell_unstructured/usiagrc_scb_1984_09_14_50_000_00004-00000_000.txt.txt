‘Grounds for thought’

1.1} 15110“ “citistock

We've bL-I'II here at school fol'
about two 'iiceks and some are
starting 11- got 21 little bit
homesick. its not like when one
wcnt to camp and was made to sit
around ‘sl campfire singing songs
about iroggies and bears. and
there weren't anv V.‘s or even a
pizza parlor. jus yucky mar.
shmallows burnt onto green twigs.
And it's not like the first time one
\i’ent out with someone and then
had to go away for a weekend and
live without him or her. No. it's
the realization that some time
soon. one is going to have to make
choices by onc's scli. and that
there is ilo olle around who is
obligated to be continually nice to
one.

But you're in luck! You're in
iowa. a place coastal people tend
to forget. and well they should.
The more they forget about it. the
more we get to keep it to
ourselves. The more they don't
realize its charms. the fewer of
them we have coming out here
and trying to sound like locals.

No. I‘m not talking about
dialect. although that's what one
tends to notice first. Having cross-
ed the Mississippi for the iirst
time a year and a half ago. I've
managed to adopt "sack" but not
"pop”; still see scallions. not
"green onions” at the salad bar.
and still am not sure what makes
up a "relish tray",

That's the obvious stuff. Sure
we understand each other. but the
idiomatic icebreakerrfor us
Easterners by training is to
exclaim loudly “It‘s a SODA. for
Chrissakc!" Also. there aren‘t
any oceans nearby. We also tend
to remark on thei tact that
downhill skiing isn't in the cards
and that 150 years isn't quite
historical enough.

Such observations aSide
There's an awful lotto be said for
this place-

31 Go into any store and say
something pleasant. Do the people
back away irom you as though
you were trying to spread the
common cold. No siri They'll
usually say something pleasant
right back and sometimes say it
iirst. Before you can whip out
your wallet. the people at the
checkout have already put your
groceries in a sack and oiiered to
carry them out to your car.

In favor of
dialogue

by iiiki» ('lcal‘v

Griiinell has thc problcm of in-
tolerance. Griniicllians can be
more openrniinded. To make a
more open community we need to
reestablish the lines oi com-
munlcatlon Before examing the

problem. 1 will focus on the advan~ '

tages oi the solution

We need a dialogue. Debate and
discussion bring all kinds oi ideas
together and reveal their
strengths and weaknesses. It
depends upon the willingness to
challenge positions and asking
questions. not complacent agree
ment Unchallenged ideas are
unrefined ideas. The greatest
benefit is that We can take the best
elements irom each opinion and
improve our own understanding oi
the world by them.

In this way we not only sharpen
our critical skills. but also bread
on our perspective, That is the
aim of a “liberal arts” education.
We also bring people together.
our national democracy relies on
us to promote our interests and
ideas, There are many situations
where the communication of ideas
is valuable. This is something we
should remember long after hav~
ing graduated from here.

Without an exchange of ideas.
we face the triple dangers of
apathy. ignorance and in-
tolerance. They are symptoms of
weakness. oi atrophy objectivity
and tolerance need exercise! The
dangers feed on the isolation of
people. and help them to grow [arr
ther apart Stereotypes. gener-
alizations, and prejudices are
incubated in a taunt atmosphere.
Problems are not :revealed .in
public. so they're ignored.

Compare our present situation
to the one just described. What do
you know about what‘s going on in
the college right novi'! 1n the ad
ministration? 1n the student
body?

Only two lull w-ccks have claps-
cd thi school year. but already
the guys who live in Brown llousc
are getting tired of hearing about
“Jock llouse" and "The Frail".

Thc dozcn young men who live
in the house between Smith and
Younker dorms don't feel that
they're much different lronl most
other groups on campus. Just
because most of them are football
players and there is a banner with
Greek letters out front is no
reason to think they're unusual

Brown House resident John
Townsley. who does not play foot
ball. said. “A lot at people don't
like us. I assume A lot of people
don't like jocks."

That jocks are oiten regarded
with El fair amount oi apprehenr
sion at Grinnell College is no real
secret. Football players. though.
seem to suffer most of the ill will.

“People won’t even come ilito
our house because they're in
llmidated." said Chris Knopfle.
who plays iootball “Someone told
inc she once talked to Craig
Taylor (a football player and
Brown House rcsldenll and she
thought it was a big deal because
he wasn't foaming at the mouth or
anything,"

Even one resident of the house.
Chuck Blomqulst. suid lhat he
lhought that tllcrc could be some
misunderstandings because oi the

pressing controversial opinions.
Others don't listen. Obviously.
Grinnell's conservatives have not
had their fair hearing. but the left
wing hasn't either Outside a cer-
tain liberal framework of ideas.
people don‘t oiten pay' attention.
Complaints of “pseudo-liberals"
are in many ways true, There is
no excuse for such close-
mindedness.

More broadly. politics itseli is
avoided by some. Types of people
are looked down upon. even
though everyone supposedly
recognized the danger oi prer
judice. Concern about policy
changes on every level is decline
ing.

These are clearly the marks at
apathy. ignorance and in~
tolerance, The element which ties
them all together is our Central
problem: lack of Communication.

If we lack communication. it is
because people do not talk. or
listen. or hothssprneimay not-ex;
press themselves for tear oi being
wrong. This is an irrational
assumption. Like so many other
limiting attributes. we must break
away train it. or. there may be a
social stigma attached to certain
opinions which kept people from
voicing their beliels.

People don't talk because they
are timid. or think that their ideas
will meet with quck attack by
ideological toes. The solutioli in
both instances require the
presence of peoplc title can listi-ii,

while he said there hadn't been
an- problems so tar. Blomqulst
s . “l was a little apprehensive
in the beginning’. I tclt there could
be some problems."

"It‘s pl‘obabl different than
something like Spanish House."
said ’1‘ownsley. He painted out that
he and his housemates did ilot
have to cook ior themselves. they
had a bigger lounge than most
houses and had a different at-
niosphere.

“When we have parties here we
just kind at hang out and
socialize." said Mark Banlk. a
sophomore transier

"I‘ve been to two schools that
have fraternities and believe me.
this is not a fraternity.” Banik
said. He said that unlike frater»
nities. Brown House has no hazing
or other such craziness

As Banik talked. he displayed
frustration at not being treated
fairly by other Grilinelliails.
Knopfle also reacted against what
he perceived to be “special treat-
ment" afforded him and the other
Bl'own House residents

More than once I was asked if 1
was going to show the house in a
bad light in this column Clearly.
some ot these guys have come to
expect ridicule.

Not all outsiders are negative.
though Alexa Hoffman dropped

There are subjective and ObjeC'
tive components necessary to be
able to listen. First. We must
respect an idea from whatever
persuasion in order to accept it.
Second. we must critically
analyze the idea in order to
understand it. Once we are able to
promote and defend an unfamiliar
idea. we should see how it inter»
prets familiar ones. Only then can
you criticize the idea objectively.
and be certain oi knowing it come
pletely.

The best way to get people to
listen is through practice. so we
need a way to practice. We need a
dialogue. A continuing discussion
ot one or related topics from
various points oi view. It may be
conducted through the
newspapers. newsletters or a
especially 7 ordinary conversa-
tion Formal discussions should
be organized. open to all points oi
View 7 their credibility depends
upon this — perhaps by reserving
a FDR

Thus we can begin a campaign
to bridge gaps oi opinion and
reconcile people. Thus we begin to
involve people more directly in all
things, Communication. if
widespread. will generate in»
terest. Curiosity is a great virtue.
and easy to acquire We must be
careful at the start to engender
ti-ust. Abuse could quickly iiltenr
sily present schisins But once
started. a dialogue shall continue
by itself.

by during the course of the Intel"
views and said. "1 like all the peo-
ple living here. It's a lot more
wcll-nianncrcd than I thought it
would be."

Although none oi the residents
are women. they tell that there
was ”no way" that they would
have lived in Ravison if they had
not gotten the house, A quick
survey found that only Townsley
had lived in the allrmale dorm last
year

As ior the sign with the Greek
letters. Banik pointed out that it
was obviously a joke In fact. the
letters. Delta Tau Kai. are the
same used for the Animal House
in the infamous movie.

“We're not a frat. and We don't
want to be a frat." said Biom-
quist. “We‘re just another coop.
We live together because we're
compatible.”

Knopfle. still miffed at all the
fuss. said. “The girls in Gates
have a flashing red light. SO
what’s wrong with a sign?"

it anyone thought that the
residents of the house had their
priorities wrong, Blomquist
reassul‘lngly said. "We're Grill-
ncll Collcgc students iii-st. party
animals second."

50 just knock on the snide
remarks about "Jock House” aiid
all that stuti. okay? The boys just
want to have fun.
