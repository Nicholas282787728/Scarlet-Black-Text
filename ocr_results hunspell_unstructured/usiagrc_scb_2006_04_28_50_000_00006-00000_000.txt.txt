Matchups of ape-like proportions,

 

King Kong. in mic a/I/Je rrwoiri mart/217mm ltrlrzl, battle: a Trsz in air/ears ofa rMINmzmi Wat/r ,

King Kong (R

1er Kong, the heavily anticipated epic ape piece
directcf by Peter Jackson, creator of The Lord afﬁx
Rings, somchow recieved ecstatic reviews last winter.
Unfortunately, reviewers drunk on PeterJacksDn’s ear-
lier success missed one important ﬂaw of the block-
buster: despite amazing and innovative special effects,
an emotionally believable giant ape and decent perr
formanccs from Jack Bluclc Adrian Brody and Naomi
watts, this film was unnecessarily long and unbeliew
ably boring,

Most viewers will agree that the special effects in
this ﬁlm are spectacular. As he demonstrated in Tb:
LuidafI/JA Ringr movies, Peter Jackson puts a great
deal of time and energy into his special effects and
constantly pushes rhe boundaries ofrhc medium. Us-
ing a similar process as that used wirh Gollum, and
the same actor. he succeeds in creating a wonderfully
humanistic gianr gorilla, Where so many other forms
of giant effects have failed before, Jackson's motion-
capture CGI_ techniques make a Kong that is agile,
expressive and powerful. Ofcoursc, Jackson doesn't
stop with Kong. Always eager to showcase his bril-
lianr effects, Jackson throws in dinosaurs and giant
insects. And, to his credit, he succeeds in making 81*
most all of these effects believable.

Unfortunately, the film does lirrlc more than 5pc»
cial effects. Determined to explore the pathetic par
thos in every character, even the two ship’s crewmen
who take a pause to delve into Joseph Conrad’s Hmrl
'Zf Dar/tum, Jackson leaves the film bloated in every
aspect. Every scene overstays its welcome and every
character ceases to be interesting. Even the famous
scene where Kong battles two Tchxes becomes ba-
nal. The film's lends do a good job in their perfor-
mances, but, when all is finished, one barely cares.

Sadly, while this film was a spectacular technical
accomplishment, Jackson's overconfldcncc in his spe—
cial effects and failure or refusal to edit himselflcavc a
film that fails to achieve the primary goal ofa popcorn
blockbuster: to entertain. After sitting through rhe
first two hours of this ﬁlm with a mixture of amuser
ment and boredom, I remember shouting inwardly,
"Leave the goddamn monkey on the island and let
me go homcl"

Match Po t (R

A departure fl cm “ﬁdlliollﬂl Woody Allen, Malt/J
Pain! proves to be Allen’s best work in 10 years. Set
in London Instead of Allen's traditional streets of
New York, the film centers on the educated but hard
up tennis pro Chris VViltoli (Jonathan Rhys-Mey-
crs) who is befriended by wellrbrcd upper CrustTom
chctl (Matthew Goods). Bcforo long he is engaged
to Tom's forching sistct,Chloe,(Emily Mortimer) and
is on the promising path to joining England's finan—
cial and social elite. Enter Nola (ll smoldering Schr-
lcttjohansson), a two-hit actress ltnd Tom's American
ﬁancéc, with whom Chris embarks on an impemous,
fiery affairJusr when he seems in diingcl oflosing his

new job, loft, and fiancee, the engagement is broken
off and N013 is swept out.

Chris continues his successful social and ﬁnancial
ascent. But when by chance encounter rhcy rekindle
their affair, the stage is reset for tmgcdy. Leaning on
the tennis metaphor for the role ofluck in life,Man}l
Paint takes several surprising, chance turns.

The set up is not unlike Allen’s own Crime: mid
Mirdcmmrtori, although the astonishing third act and
morally repugnant climax manage to turn this film
more on its head. The attractive young cast is cxccl-
lonrollsroundJohansson is exceptional as the sensual,
passionarc, insistent Nola. RhyssMcycrs, who has
been poised for a breakthrough for some time, gives
a layered, calculating performance as the poised, air

fable, cunning Chris; his portrayal allows the film to ,

be sumptuously decadent and morally revolting, leav-
ing viewers with a bitter but strangely satisfying taste
in their mouths.

Pa lse Now (R)

lfa respected community leader came to you and
solemnly rold you that you were selected by a power
ful group to commit a suicide bombing, what would
you do?

In Pal-mill: Now, Said and Khaled are two me-
chanics employed in Nablas on the west Bank. They
live in poverty with their families. After being apr
proachrd independently after a long days work, they
are informcd they have been selected to becomc sui»
cidc bombers in Tel Aviv in response to the Israeli
oppression of Palestinians Feeling oppressed by Is
racli policies and the destitute conditions of their lives,
Khalcd and said embrace the opportunity to serve the
Palestinian cause and die with honor. Much of the
ﬁlm is comprised ofterrorisr and rdigious propaganda
and discourse, such as comments like, “Under the oc-
cuparion, wc’re already dead.” Characters argue that
to die honorably is better than to live without doing
anything and that suicide bombing is a way to further
the movement for Palestinian equality. surprisingly,
for a film dealing with polarizing, bloody and mu-
tutally destructive issues, it is relatively tame. All of
the violence, dcath, suicide bombing, terrorism, and
other acts are merely discussed in the film and are not
explicitly shown. After having viewed many films
from Israel and Palestine that explicitly show the hor-
riftc acrs oftcrrorism and war taking place there, it was
refreshing ro view a film from a director wirh enough
self—restrainr to focus upon the philosophy, enigmas,
and dilcmnms ofhtrocitics such as suicide bombing its
a rcsponst: ro opprcssion and subjugation.

Said and Kltalcd ultimately form differmt views
on their coerced positions, inﬂuenced by their families,
backgrounds, convarsltlous wirh other people, and,
tnost importantly, their own feelings The most har-
rowing iispccr of the ﬁlm is that Said and Khaled are
not terrorists; rhcy are charming, respectful, diligent,
well-adjusted Palestinian men, with dreams, ctushes
and ideas. Yet because they have nothing, dying for a
cause is only a matter ofgiving up onc’s life.
