Noyes Comes Hig‘hly Recommend-
ed As Interpretative Reader—
Place in Literary World

, Recognized,

“He is a real poet, and he _lillo\\‘s
I10\\' to recite his poetry so as to give
the precise ilupicssion accessory to
transmit its meaning to the audience,"
said President Lyman P. Powell, lio-
‘bart College, Genera, t', Y,, speaking
or Alfred Noy es, the distinguished Elig-
iish poet, u ho comes lleie on the r. M
C. A. Lecture Course on the evening of
Friday. Nmelnher l‘J.

Populiii ill America.
,Altred Noyes is a young man, and
yet he has published tire loluliics oi
verso. He has paid several visits to
the United States, in tile course oi
which he .has gained tor himselt a
popularity in this country probably one
ceedihg that or ally other living poetil
He is one oi the row whom the world
has acknowledged great.

To hear tlic ideas and opinions oi

' any real poet is a treat not to be light.»
Iy regarded, and wheil that poet has
vile power to interpret his own poetry
as has M \‘oyes, to hear him becomes
an ambition. Alfred Noyes continues
the tradition oi Victorian romanticism,
a strain eagerly uclcomed in this
practical, commercial age.

The Milwaukee Journal says of him:
"He is not a poet's poet, he is a poet
tor men. He is broadesliouldered, man-
ly and sturdy, and the dominant qual-
ity or his poetry is virility. He is in
teresting in many other ways. A young
man who .dcvotes his lite, from the
time he leaves his university, to poet-
l-y, and who has a. beautiful, dctinite
message which he delivers in no on
certain voice, attracts far more than
casual notice even in a practical, com»

mercizil age," .

Professor Theodore S. \Voolsey, of
Yale, says: "Mr. Noyes has won the
anbroval of the critics, and, what is
more, the ear
read his tongue"

The occasion oi the coming of Mr.
Noyes to Grinliell will be one or the
greatest literal-y treats of the year. it
is to he expected that he will be en»
thusiastically received. He will one
pear in Herrick chapel and semester
