What exciting magic there is in cigarette
advertising!

Let’s look at one of its greatest illusions
...that cigarettes can be mysteriously given
superior "unveil."

m: EXPLANA‘IION: Just three factors con-
trol the ﬂavor of a cigarette.The addition of
artiﬁcial ﬂavoring...the blending of various
tobaccos...and the quality of the tobaccos
themselves. Quality is the most impor-
tant. Artiﬁcial ﬂavoring can never wholly
disguise the poor ﬂavor of cheap tobaccos.

, n. J. hcyocltls Tunin- CVWW

BLEND

The blending of several cheap, raw t0-
baccos cannot improve the ﬂavor of any
of them. A ﬁne cigarette is a cigarette
blended from costly, ripe tobaccos.

M It is a fuel, well known by leaf N:-
bucco experts, 'llﬂ" Camels are

made from liner, MORE EXPENSIVE
tobacco: than any other popular brand.

This is Why the Camel ﬂavor has never
been rivaled . . . Why Camels have given
more pleasure to more people than any
other cigarette ever made.

In more costly tobacco: lies the secret of
Camels’ delicate “bouquet”...of their rich,
cool ﬂavor—of their non-irritating mildness.

It’s the tobacco that counts.

All the natural goodness of Camel‘s to-
bacco is kept fresh and rich for you by the
lair-tight, welded Humidor Pack. Don’t re—
move it. Its moisture-proof cellophane also
protects your Camels from dust and genus.
Put a pack in your pocket today.
