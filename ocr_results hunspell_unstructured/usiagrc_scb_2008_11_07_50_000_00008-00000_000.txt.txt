The primary iiile the Grinnell restaurant
reviewer has to keep in mind rs that we are in
Grinnell. Iowa. Since we don't have thl: most
options, we frnd the role that each restaurant
has to play and enjoy it for what it has to of
fer,

Bourbon Street, where brrsry mannequins
watch you car jarnbalaya could soon have a
valued place at rhe Grinnell table. They put
earnest work into providing rrniquc options
fora range or different tastes m an clcganr, if
schizophrenic, sorting.

Located on Main Street across from the
Strand Theater, Bourbon Street is Grinnell’s
newest restaurant, having opened just two
weeks ago in what was formerly the locnrion of
Jimbos Down Under Pub. It is the next link of
a chain that staired' in Cedar Falls, Iowa They
seive Cajun, Creole and American food with
a wide spread of specialty drinks and bottled
beer.

Bourbon Street offers the most diverse
menu and one ofthe more elegant settings in
Grlnnell, though it comes at a price, It has the
potential to be a great Ol‘lCeTll‘rﬂTV/lllle treat, a
place to get your parents to take you,or a regu-
lnr spot if you watch what you order.

Still, the atmosphere is strange. The rnur
sic follows no real theme, and the decor is a
little bit ridiculous In a loft above the dim
rows of booths. three or four female manne-
quins dressed like showgirls are lravrng what

looks like a pretty good loo ggia party, complete
with party beads and an anatomically spot on
helse.

If my mother knew I was eating at rhe
kind ofplace frequentcd by such women, she
wouldn’t be too pleased. But. since they are
just mannequins, she would probably just gcr
over it and ask me what the food was like.

Following the suggestion of our energetic
server, we chose their signature appetizer, the
Cajun Kamikaze Tuna. 0Also available as an
entrée. the fillets were seared in a strong dry
seasoning that had its own appeal in addition
to the tenderness ofthc tuna.

For the main course, 1 passed up the tempt-
ing Bleu Cheese Filer and Acadiarr Pcppered
Sligrimp for thc crawfrsh Etouffee, which was
a mix ofcrawfrsh tails, vegetables and garlic rn
a creamy sauce served over rice. The sauce was
the right amount of thickness so that it didn’t
feel soupy or heavy as pasti sauce, and I was
happy to find our rarlrer quickly that no spici-
ness was spared for the ostensibly wcak Mid—
rvesrcrn palate. My dining companion ordered
the Blackened Prime Frlet, which, thorrgh
lacking in presentation, benefitted from the
strong Cajun juiccs in which it waded in the
center ofrhe plate.

Most entrees come with a choice of two
sides. Since my dish came with just a house
salad we were only able to try the Dirty Rice
and Mashed Sweet Potatocs. The rice was a
mostly blended ﬂavorful starch complement
to the Prime Filet. lhe mashed sweet potar

tot-s sounded promising, bur were just a bit
too much potato and not enough swcct. Thar
may just be my opinion of sweet potatoes in
general, bur the spotlight remained on the ap-
pctizcrs.

After these frlling corrrses (separated by a
delicious cornbread with creole honey glazc),
we ordered the Mississippr Mud Pro, which
was a fairly srraighrforward chocolate mousse
cake but was nevertheless a satisfying end to
the meal.

Though I understand rhar the tough times
on Wall Street are making it to Main Street,
they don't have to direct your time at Bourbon
streer.Tlrc price only hurts as much as you let
it. lfyou spare the appetizers and drinks, you
can still enjoy a ﬁlling, tasty and reasonably
priced meal under dim light and a fake horse’s
halls.

Downstairs is the Voodoo Lounge, the
button-down replacement for the Dowannr
der Pub that ttadcs PBR pitchers for Voodoo
Mistva sixtyrounce specialty drink served
with dry ice in a grant goblet. They serve the
same selection ofspecralty drinks and bottled
beers as Bourbon Street as well as a number
or similar appetizers. The mood is decidedly
elegant, due to rows of black leather couches
and paintings ofslecprng halfrriudes lining the
walls. It doesn’t feel like Grinnell. but that isn't
such a bad thing every once in a while.

Girl meets toy: under the covers of the masturbation workshop

Students discuss how to use their bodies to love their bodies and Katherine Gregersen gives it to us firsthand

BY KrtTl IERINE GREGERSEN

As we filed through the door to Main
Lounge this past Monday evening, we were
greeted wrth kisses and female genitalia. Never
mind that the kisses were Hershey's and the
female genitalia were diagrams on paperiit
was exciting all the'same.

In the beginning of the Feminist Action
Coalition (FAC)rsponsored Masturbation
Workshop, we were put to the arduous task of
naming the 15 or so parts of the external rc-
productive organs of the female. Many names
were vaguely familiar—Perincum? others
were somehow reminiscent of a Tenacious D
songiUrcthral mcarus? 1 had to crack a smile,
but even as we laughed, I sensed that many
of us Wcrc somewhat ashamed of our lack of
knowledge ere seeing a photograph of onc's
back for rhe first time, it can bc rrnncrving to
discover the details of the downstairs. I dEﬁT
nitcly had something to learn.

Aftcr\vards,\ve s lit rrp into smaller groups
where discussion b no more personal. We
talked about masturb on n ~olcly a means to
aclricve orgasm, or its_ st .r pr rvate relationship

to have with oneself regardless ofthc outcome
of a session. As FAC member Emma Lawlcr
’09 put it, “there is no wrong way to much
yourself."Tluu seemed to be the rhcme or the
eveningithe abolition of the normal. Do what
you want with yourself, no one’s watching.

When the walls were down, the questions
came up.What does an orgasm feel like? How
often do other women masturbate? What is
the difference betwccn a vibrator-induced oi-
gasm and a hand-induced orgasm? How did
everyone discover masturbation?

A few women spoke of naturally discow
cring masturbation. (Newsﬂash: rubbing rrp
against a desk can be more stimulating than
doing homework on it.) Others remembered it
being a light bulb moment when they realized
that males wcrcrr’r the only ones who could
masturbate.

For some. the workshop was the first time
that they had spoken openly about masturba-
tion on a personal levell .ru unsurc whcrhcr-
this would be the best forum in which to ini»
tiara cunvers ini ilmttt such a “touchy"sub-
ject lftme had never talkcd about it before, it

could be qrritc overwhelmingAs vibrators and
scented lube were tossed around the room,I
imagined that one could easily feel intimidated
by the amount ofknowledgc and equipment it
miglrr require to pleasure oneself and phrases
like “clitoral stimulation" and “female ejacular
tioii” could cause discomfort when uttered in
front ofmore rhan so people.

That feeling of uneasiness can dissipate
quickly thorrgh. Ttvortime arrcndcc Joanna
DeMars ’10 remarked that she “felt a lot less
comfortable [her] first time [at the work-
shop]." And the PAC cerlcadcrs emphasized
that an introduction to masturbation might
begin slowlyiwhilc wearing pants, for ex-
itmple,A rrip to the Lions Den offl»80 might
cornc lntcr in the sclesev story. Everybody has
thcir own timeline and their own masturbir
my journey.

But despite FAC's commitment to the
there-is-no-wrnag-way ideology, I perceived
a prct cnce tor roys ovcr ringers Vibrators
were given as piizes and the handle oi a butlei
knife wls iecolnmendtd 11 ohm l stimular
tor. While 1 agree thar objc s lr.ue a platc ru

masturbation, I also believe that masturba-
tion is an intimate and empowering relation
ship that one has with oneself. Being able to
achieve orgasm solely rrsing orrc’s body signals
independence and self-sufficiency

Think about . fyou were trekkrng on a
glacier and fell into a crevice, would you want
to have something to do for the next three
weeks? I certainly would, but I’m not going to
carry butter knives in my backpack.

You could also happen to fall into that
crevice with another unlucky trekker. And then
you might want to inform him or her of how
to please you. Some attendees proposed that
it's important to know what one enioys sexu-
ally before entering a beloWrthcrbclt wrestling
match.
