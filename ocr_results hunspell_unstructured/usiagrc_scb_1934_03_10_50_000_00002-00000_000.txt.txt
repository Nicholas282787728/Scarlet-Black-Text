A POINT IN PROOF.

If any criticism of the women’s recent intrav
mural dancing contest should be made it would
best be in respect to the excellence of tile acts
rather than the surprisingly rare moments of
mediocrity. Most of the acts exhibited very COEﬂv
mendable originality and the costuming throughout
was both well adapted and inexpensive The
dance routines, too, were well done in general, one
or two showing admirable precision for the limited
amount of practice. All of which gives rise to the
puzzling question of lvlly these some women voted
down the proposed revival of the Pioneer Pruditics
on the grounds that preparation of the acts would
require too much time, and would illvolvc too great
an expense.

A comparison of the respective requirements
for a contest act and a Pruditics act makes the in
consistency of the women’s stand on the rcvue
only too apparent. The cost of each act in the
intramural affair wus restricted to $3, whereas
the revue qualification set $5 as the maximum ex-
penditure for each hall and cottage, and the Grill-
noll chapter of Sigma Delta Chi guaranteed to
refund all expenses after presentation of the show.

Two weeks of more or less intensive practice
were put ill by the \‘alious casts in the dancing
contest. It has been estimated that a threeaveek
period would have provided sufficient practice for
the Pmdity skits, which appears logical when the
comparatively high quality of the contest bits is
considered. An even greater saving of time would
be made possible in that a script for the Prudity
acts would he prepared in advance, eliminating the
necessity of each group originating its own shit.

While it is too late to organize a school revue
before the end of the present school year, plans
are already being laid for producing the Prudilics
next year. \Vith such condosivc proof as the slice
cc 5 of the dancing contest to convince the oppo ~
ing factions that they were lnistakcngor misledi
ill their oppo tion to the rcvuc, they should be
more than willing to do their hit toward reviving
the Pioncer Pruditics.

RECOGNITION?

As President Roosevelt asks the public what it
thinks about the wisdom of recognizing Mall-
chukuo, he presents a problem whose answer may
carry tremendous significance. Our first thought
is of its relation to Japan, and we are inclined to
wonder whether the recognition of this puppet
state might spread some oil on the troubled waters
between Japan and America.

But the problem of recognition concerns much
besides American-Japallesc relations. What will
be the effect on tlle historic friendsllip between
China and the United States‘.Z What will become
of the recent improved relations between our coun-
try and Ru la? What sort of a precedent will
we be establishing by being the first to sanction a
so-called faiteaceomplis which was brought about
ill defiance of the Kellogg pact, the Nine Power
treaty and the League of Nations covenant?

Two years ago we offered the world a state»
nlcnt of policy which might well be a significant
and lasting step toward world peace. Secretory
Stimson said that the United States would not
recognize any conditions brought about in violar
tion of the peace treaties. The rest of the world
immediately recognized the potential good of such
a policy, and within two months of Stimson’s decr
loration, the entire Assembly of the League of
Nations unanimously endorsed the ”Stimson Doc-
trine.

The United States worked long for a World
Court, and when it was finally established, refused
to join it. Our President made possible the League
of Nations, and we have refused to become a meme
her, Now we have produced the Stimson Doctrine;
while the world has accepted it, can we repudiate
it'.l Will Europe think we have kept the faith’.I

If we wish to improve our relations with
Japan, we can do it in many ways without com-
promising,- principles and breaking faith. We
could very well repeal our Japanese Exclusion Act,
which seems to assume the yellow race to be
inferior to our own and so offers the oriental ll. lie

and all illslllt at the same time. Placing the
Japanese oil a quota basis would remove this insult
without adding in any way to the difficulties of
foreign illnlligrution to America, since it negligible
number would be admitted llndcr this policy. ‘Or
we might even try a different naval policy, since
we are, beginning to see already that American
building under llie Vin, n bill is only encouraging
a like onslvcr ill both Japan and England. Presi
dent Roosevelt is quite right if he thinks it is high
time we try to improve relations with Japan, but
their are for better ways than the recognition of
)Iallclluliuo.

THE COLLEGE KACKET
(lniliniia Daily student)

Going to college is called “the great American rack-
et" by President Ralph Cooper Hutchinson of Washing
ton and Jefferson college in one of the most scathing de-
nunciations of the present higher educational system and
its students issued within the last few months.

President Hutchinson charges that most student or-
ganizations, both past and present, were formed for
graft, and that frateinity jewelry salesmen and other
agents declare that they simply can not do business on
some campuses without practicing graft. He decries the
fact that in general the old ideals of education, culture
and character have been submerged by the motives of
social and financial profit,

He does not let the matter drop without a reason.
Hutchinson declares that the rapid pioneer expansion of
the nation created a demand for men of training greater
than the supply, and therefore a college degree took on
a great practical significance. The general public hence
was encouraged to “send its young men and women
through the sausage grinder and out with a packer's
trademark."

The bitter charges of one so closely in touch with
the university system can not be ignored. It is probable
that the American college system has been permeated in
the past by a great amount of graft, but there is a light«
er side to the picture. The university students Seem to
be staging a “new deal" of their own in this respect. Or-
ganizations are having to justify themselves to exist,
graft isn't tolerated as it once was and there is a grow-
ing interest in the real intellectual purpose of a college
education.

BACK-BITING

(Butler Collegian)

Butler is accomplishing one of the main purposes
of a university by fostering opinion and discussion
among its students, but that opinion is coming to be
“griping” based on whims and fancies instead of facts

Students who object to certain practices of the
administration, faculty members, and student groups
make their deprecatory rtmsrks to one another, being
very careful to guard against the offending person‘s
discovery of the citiclsm.

This private “griping” is growing into a habit with
many students who are afraid to have their names at-
tached to their statements. They criticize only with the
idea of breaking down what someone else has built, not
with a view of making helpful suggestions.

The student opinion column of The Collegian is
open to carefully thought-out objection which should
he brought before the student body or facultv members
Most habitual “gripers” will see the errors of their
argument it they attempt to put them on paper, while
constructive efforts will seem more plausible than be-

”Modernizing the Rocky mountains
is equivalent to hiirlesquing our fine
old works of art," maintained Sclden
H. Norris, instructor in business ad
ministration, in his protest against
government road building projects

Mr. Norris observed that hundreds
of miles of road have been construct-
ed With no excuse for existence except
to satisfy the whims of efficiency ex»
pcrts who have been drained o[ all
feeling and understanding of natural
beauty.

“Roads take from thc mountains
something which cannot be replaced,”
the speaker continued, “They admit
to the mountain a class of invading,
restless nomads whose chief interest
is high speed."

Mr. Norris predicted that this ex-
pensive “governmental blunder” will
result in more and more roads and
eventually the solitude of the mounr
tains and all trace of the wilderness
of the past will be totally destroyed
at the hands of efficiency experts.
