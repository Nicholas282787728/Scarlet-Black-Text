By Jack Wile.

Stan ZaJlller, veteran guard on
Giinnell's cage team has been
promised a tree Cake for every
one-hand push shot he makes dur-
ing a game. The donor is Duane
Arnold, coeproprietor of the White
Spot

Although Zahller's point-totals
llaveil’l: been sensational while
playing with the Pioneers, that
one-handed shot was his special-
ty before he came hei . He hit
20 points in one game in Chari-
ton Junior college,

When Coe comes here Saturday
night, we'll see two flashes from
Mitchellvdle playing on opposing
teams. 0n Gl'irlnell's side or the
fence, we have "Pat” Patterson,
high scoring forward and the
shortest man on the Squad, The
Kohawlts have Henry Moss, let»
terman and forward for two
years
These two boys played together

at forward positions for Mitchell-
ville High school during their jiine
ioi- and senior years, Moss star-
red in the CorteGTinllell game last
year when he made 10 out of ll
tree throws.
Aiter the Monmouth game Mona
day night, the comments by the
visiting players indicate that
Coe's fast»b1'eztk must really “be
somethill'.” It’s a kind of “new
you see it, new you don't” system
rvnow they’re at one end of the
ﬂoor, now they're down at the
other end making a basket.

The Pioneers have allowed their
opponents less points per game
than any other team in the con—
fel'ence. They have allowed 278
points in nine games, 30.9 points
per contest. However, the Ripon
five are close behind with an
average of 31.3 tallies allowed per
game and may take the lead be»
tore long.

Five Knox athletics have had
