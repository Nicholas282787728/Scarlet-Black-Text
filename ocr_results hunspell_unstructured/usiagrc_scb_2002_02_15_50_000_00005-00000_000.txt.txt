pus. it's not a bad thing, necessarily, it‘s
just that diircrenr people like dirrerent
things, and not each other.

North Campus kids dread the Big
Game, South campus kids dread their
hair.

South Campus residents enjoy form
ing horrendous bands and drinking cl'lcap
beer while North Campus residents en.
joy grinding to popular horrendous bands
and drinking cheaper beer.

And, after graduating, South Campus
kids travel around saving the world, and

This longstanding dichotomy, hows
ever, is about to change rorcver. East
Campus is coming in the Fall of‘04, and
a third category or student will have to
inhabit its halls. The only question is,
who will rhese people be?

Historically, when people start addc
ing :xtm categories to alreadyncarly-cztc
egorizcd groups, weird things start to hapc
pen.

For example, for a long, long time,
there were three dirrcrent stares of mar.
rergoses, liquids. and solids. This made
sense. Things that ﬂoated around were
gasses, things that swishcd around were
liquids, and the things that sat around
were solids. Then, scientists round the

Plasma doesn't really ﬁt with the other
states ormatter, or with anything else. if
you ask a scientist what plasma is, exactly,
she will say something like, “Plasma is
the fourth state ormatter. it is not a liq-
uid, gas, orsolid. it lives in outcrspace, l

kind otsounds gooey Do you hear that,)
Plaazazsmz.”

Its the same deal with rhe rourth di.
mension and the sixth sense e they're car-
egories to rake up the slack, places to pur
inconsistencies. ,

These “afterthought" categories are ale
ways esoteric, probably because the
people who thought them up were mlka
ing out or their asses. “the sixth scnsc,"
they say, “ is when you iusr sort orsense
something, you know?"
