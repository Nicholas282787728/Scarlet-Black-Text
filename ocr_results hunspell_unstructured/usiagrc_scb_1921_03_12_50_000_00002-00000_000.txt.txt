the past twenty-ioni- hours, again

brings up the question of the bestY

means of» bettering Harvard; minor
sport teams," consoles us in thc iact
that Grinuell is not the only college
having her troubles with athletics.
The Crimson goes on to advocate the
recognition of 3. minor sports Council
to act in an advisory capacity with
the athletics department.
' This brings to mind the old athr
letic board of control‘which used to
he more prominent on the local cums
.pns. One of the good features of such
'a board was the fact that it had a
student representative. Supposedly
it was the body in full control of
Grinnell’s athletic relations. it was
, composed of President Main, ‘Lhree
alumni, and one student.

In View of the great personal in
,terest which a large majority of the
students take in the success of Grin-
nelljs athletic teams, and in View of
the occasional disagreements regard—
ing athletic policies-could not is work
able 1119.11 for a, Student-alumni ath-
letic council be. worked out, which
Would have charge 01 the general pols
icics, of athletic relations, and might
even consult .wi'th the president and

' head of the athletic department on

the choosing of coaches for the major,-

IDOYtS teams? After all the students
are the ones who do the performing,
and are the ones who are expected
to give the teams and the coaches
their support ..

This council should be carefully
picked, with both athletes and non—
atplctes on the board, Alumni or
students who are sports writers of
experience in following their teams
might ptuye of Value on the board.
Director Huff, President Main, and
one or two prominent alumni, togeth-
er with four or five students; would
make up a. Valuable advisory body to
the athletic administration, and could
represent the students in matters of
interest to the college.

COLLEGE DEFICITS

We note with interest the fact that
the Harvard Corporation, the govern-
ing board of Harvard University, has
found it necessary to make large in.
creases, in one or two, cases nearly
80%, in tuitiuns in the various col-
leges of the university, in spite of a
recent increase of $12,000,000 of its
endowment funds.

This move substantiates the many
statements made during the firinnell
endowment campaign to the effect
that all colleges, large as well as
small. have found it impossible to
keep operating without increased in—
comes. The Harvard deficit last
year was $161,000, and a deficit of
over $300,009 is expected this
according to reports of the treasurer.

SOPHOMORE BMW
(From The Harvard Crimson)

During the ’latter part of their
Sophomore year a large percentage
of serious thinking undergraduates
become dissatisfied with college. into
the student's mind comes the ques-
tio . "Just what am I proving here?"
From this he argues that after all, the

year.

supeliority of the college man is

greatly over—rated. Life in the world

can: to him and, like a horseJBstless

to begin the race, he becomes impal-
tlent. At this period the student looks
in retrospect over his first two years
as an undergraduate, seeing in, them
either a failure to make of himself
what school—day ambition carved or a
disillusionment regarding the ,value
of his activities social or athletic. At
this period, too, the Sophomore feels
thlt it Is tline to "find himself." He
discards his views on what constitutes
argood fellow"—judges menl less by
the clothes they wear and courses less
from the “sine " attitude, In a
word, the Sophomore begins to grow
up. He considers himself a man. For,
in truth, the youth of twenty feels as
old as he thinks he ever will. In this
“maturity" the mind’s balancing seals
wcighs heavily toward business, tow-
ard—as we have heard many under-
graduates say—“life."

For the Sophomore who thus finds a
university career not Worth continu-
ing, it would be well to consider care—
fully both sides of the question. His
older friends, now in business, will
tell him what he has heard countless
times, namely, “to stick!” This brings
only a. yawn from the tired college
