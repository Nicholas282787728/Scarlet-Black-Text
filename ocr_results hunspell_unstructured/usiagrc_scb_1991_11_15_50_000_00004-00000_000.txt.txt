SCARLET & BLACK:

Psychology, biology professors discuss animal experimentation

By Karen Nutter

Mention the words “animal ex-
perimentation" and some people pic-
ture monkeys in straitjackets and rab-
bits with nail polish on their eyeballs.
They imagine biology professors dis»
sectin g live cats and psychology pro»
fessors running mice through barbed
wire mazes.

None of the above procedures are
conducted zit Grinnell. However, that
does not mean animal research does
not take place here, nor does it mean
that this research does not involve
controversy.

Grinnell’s Biology Department
routinely uses animals for dissection,
andboth the Psychology andBiology
Departments use live animals in ex-
periments performed in intro-level
labs and advanced projects. Contro-
versy and debate emerges when some
students in thesedepartrnents are con-
fronted with experiments that they
feel violate their personal ethics.

Some labs involving the use of
animals are mandatory (including
Intro Psychology and Biology 116
labs), and students seeking alterna-

‘ tivesto these procedures conﬂict with
professors who view animal research
as being necessary to the disciplines.
Resolution of this conﬂict demands a
closer lookatGi-innell’s attention and
committnent to the ethics of all in-
volved.

Institutional Review Board

Ofﬁcially. the saga of animal re
search on campus begins with the
InstitutionalReviewBoardflRB).The
National Institute of Health’ 5 Animal
Welfare Act recommends that all in-
stitutions which conduct animal or
human research retain a board of fac-
ulty members to evaluate the ethics of
this research, and Grinnell is no exa
ception.

Any professor or student on this
campus who wishes to use animals or
humans in a new experiment must
submit a written proposal detailing
the project and the expecred effect
upon the animal or person to the IRE
for evaluation The lIRB, which con-
sists this year of political sciencepro—
fessor Keith Fitzgerald. psychology
professors Janet Gibson and David
Lopatto, economics professor Irene
Powell and education professor
Martha Voyles, then evaluates the
proposal.

According to David Lopatto, chair
of the Psychology Department and
long-term member of the IRB, said
the first criterion used in evaluating
dieseproposalsis thelawffheAmeri-
can Psychological Association issues

these publications (such as “Guide-
lines for the Well-Being of Rodents
in Research") when evaluating the
ethics of a particular proposal. For a
proposal to pass. it “has to answer all
the questions" and thus conform to
the regulations espoused by the APA.

According to Janet Gibson, psyv
chology professor and chair of the
RB, these questions include those
regarding theanimal’shealth,suchas
where it is kept during the research,
where it came from, and whether or
not the animal is at any risk, If the
majorityof the group feels the project
endangers theanimal, then it does not
approve the project. lts author must
then change the objectionable proce4
dures before re-submitting the pro
posal for approval. Gibson pointed
out, however, that the few proposals
which get rejected are turned down
because of ambiguous language and
unclear outlines of procedure.

“Nothing really heavy” is ever
submittedto the IRB, stressed Gibson.
adding that no controversy has ever
ensued because of a proposal‘s acv
ceptance. Gibson stated that, over the
last two years, the IRB has evaluated
only six proposals, most of which
have involved human research (such
as last year‘s “PC poll" conducted by
the sociology depanment) and none
of which have been found unaccept»
able.

Biology Experiments

Animal use within the Biology
Department is conﬁned primarily to
Intro Biology 116, which concen-
trates on living organisms, and the
Vertebrate Anatomy class. Accord-
ing to Karl DeLong, director of 116
and professorof Vertebrate Anatomy,
students irt 116 anesthetize and dis-
sect live cockroaches, dissect fetal
pigs,injectwhitemicewith hormones
which affect their metabolisms, and
extract muscles from frogs in order to
study muscle tension and contrac-
tion. Students in the Vertebrate
Anatomy class dissect such animals
as sharks, salarnanders, cats, rabbits
and minks.

DeLong stated that very few stu-
dents complain about these proce-
dures, and those who doare normally
only seeking a deeper understanding
of the procedures. He stressed the
necessity of using animals in the labs
by comparing pictures of famine in
Sudan with pictures orcomputersimu»
lations of anatomy ~just as one can-
not fully comprehend Sudan’s plight
by just looking at pictures and not
visiting the region, one cannot fully
understand anatomy without looking
at actual organs

“Plastic doesn’t get the same re-
sults,“ said De Long.

Stating that animal research is an
issue dependent on value judgment,
DeLong stressed that there is a re-
spectful attitude within the Biology
Departmenttownrdstheanimals used.
He said the animals are “killed hu-
manely," laughing at this seeming
paradox but emphasizing the care
taken to insure that animals do not

etherized upon the completion of the
lab, but stated that is also a painless
procedure. l-le speculated that the
animals used for education might not
be considered differently than those
animals used for food or clothing.

DeLong also speculated on value
judgmentwhcn explaining where the
dcpanment obtains their animals. The
salamanders, rabbits and mice, for

instance, areraiscdinbiologicallabo-
ralorics expressly for experiments.
Minks are delivered already without
their skins to the department, and
DeLong thus assumes their fur has
already gone into makingcoats. Cats,
he assumes, come from inner city
animal shelters. The feta] pigs come
fromsowssoldforslaughter.DeLong
stated he did not know what else
could be done with such animals ex-
cept learn from them; if the animals
are only going to be incinerated,
DeLong stated, it is a “bonus" to be
able to ”learn a tremendous amount”
from them.

DeLong expressed reservations 0
when commenting on the capture of
sharks: these,hesaid,arecollccted in
the wild by supply houses and are
“notkilled in the mosthumaneway.”
He would not expand on this state-
mcnt, choosing to say instead that he
and many of his students would be
willingto"paymorc”forthesharksif
they were captured and housed under
more humane conditions.

Psychology Department

The Psychology Department regur
larly uses rats and mice in both “edu-
cation-related labs andnovel research
projects." The introlevel classes use
the rats in labs designed to teach stu
dents about behavioralism. These
experiments have been done many
times before and are designed simply
to “add to the body of knowledge“ of
the student, not of the field of psy—
chology. according to Lopatto.

Responding to rumors that “novel
research projects“ conducted by stu-
dents and faculty are performed in
semi-secrecy to avoid controversy,
Lopattodeniedwithholdinginforma-
tion on the grounds of it being too
controversial or technical.

One research project being con-
ducted by a psychology major and
professor team involves brain chemr
istry in rats. The student performs
surgery on the rat in this experiment,
implanting an electrode in its brain in

order to measure metabolism and
oxidation levels when the rat eats.

After the surgery is performed, the"
rat is given approximately one week‘
to recover, and then data is collected
for two to four weeks by attaching a'
monitor to the electrode in its bmina
every time the rat eats. At the end of
the experiment, the rat’s brain must‘
be removed in order to fully under-
stand the data. This project is a modi-
fication of a previous experiment,
and some professional data exists re-
garding it, but it still had to be cvalu- ,,
atcd and approved by the IRB.

Rats used in psychology experi-‘
ments such as the intro- level labs are .
cared for by paid student workers
When the experiments are over, the
rats may be used in othcrexpcriments‘
or offered to students as pets, stated ‘
Lopatto. But as the department is
"underan obligation to ensure a good '
home"forthe rats,explainedGibson,.
giving rats to students is sometimes
problematic. Rats that are not taken ‘
home by students and cannot be used .
in other experiments are chloro-
formed. ’

Colin Kirkman’s conflict with the Psychology Department encom»

In April of 1990, Kirkman was a first year student interested in
GeneralPsychology, Already committed to the beliefthat tats should not
be used as “an expendable source of life” and that the u-aditional rat labs
were "the most widely researched, written about, and well known
[experiments] in the field of psychology," she attempted to find an
alternative to Intro Psychology rat labs.

She was told that alternatives were not available at Grinnell, but that
she could take the course at another institution. Kirkman saw this option
as implying that rat labs really were not part of the necessary course work
load, since she could get credit for a course without rat experiments, so
long as it was taken at another college.

Kirkman spoke to the Psychology Department explaining her views
and then senta letter to the Committee on Academic Standing. The letter
eventually reached the Curriculum Committee. Nonetheless, several
months later, all Kirkman had was a note in her mailbox, expressing
appreciation for her concern and efforts but stating that the decision
tested with the department of psychology. The administration did not
