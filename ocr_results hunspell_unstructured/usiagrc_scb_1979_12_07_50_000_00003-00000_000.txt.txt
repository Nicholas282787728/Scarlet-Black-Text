from the editor

‘And in the end....’

Issue #14ethe last 8&3 of the first semester, and the last
issue of my editorship.

Fourteen issues ago we were, in Andrew Schultz‘s phrase, ,
“the new look 83:13.” Well, by now, the look isn’t so new: peo-
ple are finally realizing that we’re not a newspaper. Most now
like the new formatebut some, as the letters section indicates,
still don’t understand us. :

We are not trying to duplicate the Campus Memo~if people '
want listings of events, they can check the calendar or the
Memo. What we are trying to do is present articles that are in"
teresting, well-written and thought—provoking Sometimes we '
fulfill more of these objectives than other times, but that’s only'
natural.

We are a forum for discussion of campus issues, and as such:
we both accept opinion pieces and attempt to explore campus '2
issues ourselves I

No, we‘re not Time magazine and we never will be. A
publication put out by college students can never be ;
perfect—but we are trying and have, for the most part, achiev1
ed a high level of professionalism. :

Things also should be better next semester: everyone has a :
little more experience, and the staff is also gaining competent Z
personnel returning from off-campus study.

But there’s one thing to never forget: this is, as our mastheai
says, Grinnell College’s student newsmagazine. It is not run by
an elite group of nameless editorsl If you want to make fullest
use of the S&B’s potential, let us know. It‘s your newsmgazine’,
