’19 Cyclone Cuts Out

Useless Extravagance

Owing to the fact that the United
States is now at war and that lavish
expenditures are contrary to public
policy. the 1919 Cyclone board is striv-
ing after simplicity instead or needless
extravagance which often times char-
acterizes college annuals.

The 1919 Cyclone board has not
economized in any way in producing
the best in design and quality of ma,
terial so necessary to the success of a
college yearbook. But the present
situation is such that the producers
feel that loyal Grinnellians will any
prove their etiorts to give them the
very best yearbook possible without
wasteful expenditures.

Chas. E. Clindinin '11, who has been
employed at the Hartsoanonson Drng
(20., of Rock Island, has been appoint.-
ed chief chemist for the Standard Oil»
cloth Co of that city.
