"Reveal“Cosis Of Sports Palace

Four years after the ground
was broken the new Physical
Education Complex has been
completed at a cost of
$2,600,000 according to
Treasurer Donald Lambie.
During the period of Septem*
her i, 1967 through June 30,
1971, the college plant fund’s
expenditures have exceeded
receipts by $2,250,2l7, due to
the necessity of other acidic
tions to campushc’ilities such
as the bookstore addition and
the relocation of athletic
fields. These other projects
account for the total obligzr
tions owed in plant funds on
June 30, 1971.

Aid from the Federal govern-
ment has been in the form ofa
$943,000 loan to be repaid over
a period of thirty years and a
$537,841 grant. No Federal
funds were available unli180%
of the Complex was completed.
Short term bank loans with
high interest rates increased

the cost of building, but the
Federal loans have much
lower interest rates. The
Complex was built primarily
for instructional and recrea-
tional use. Although intercol-
legiatc Cvents such as swimr
ming will be held in the Com-
plex, had it been built specir
fically for only intercol legiatc
sports, the Federal governv
inenl, "probablywouldn’thavc
given us the money," said
Dean Walker.

The board of trustees passed
a resolution in November,
l97o establishing budget
guidelines which involved
raising $1,200,000 in uni
restricted gifts lohelp finalico
thc duflcll made by the Com-
plex. Of the $1,200,000,
$600,000 must go into the F.
E. plant funds. According to
Dean Walker, approximately
$200,000 could be expected
this year to go into the plant
fund.

No restricted gifts have been
designated to the P. E. Com'
plex so far. The lack of gifts
“may be due to the peculiar
circumstance that people con-
sider a building like the li»
brttry the ultimate in educa-
tional facilities but a P. E.
Complex is not so highly rca
garded by the gift~giver,“ said
Treasurer Lambie.

Dean Wall said he was ”sur-
prised there weren’t more
gifts," and offered the theory
that, ”perhaps it’s because the
economy is not as strong as
when the library was built."
The projected annual operate
ing cost is approximately
$80,000. That will cover
maintenance wages, equip
ment, insurance, and utilities.
The estimate could vary as
much as $10,000 more or less
because, as Treasurer Lam»
bie noted, "the budgetdepends
on how much the P. E. Complex
is used.”

Robinson Invites Students To His Party

by Phil Sasich

The appearance ofSteve Rob-
inson, Executive Secretary of
the Republican State Central
Committee, gave Grinnell stu-
dents one of the few oppor-
tunities to hear a man firmly
dediwted to the concept of
party politics. Mr. Robinson,
as expected, called on students
to participate in party politics.
He indicated a displeasure
with those who proclaim dis-
illusionment and frustration,
but never enter the process
and work for change. He feels
further that young people are
led to demandsimpliaticsolu‘
tions to complexproblemsand
become frustrated when
change doesn't happen. He was
essentially saying that stu-
dents really know very little
of political reality and neceSA
sity, and thus leave them~
selves to react from ignore
ance.

He contended that a basic
factor in disillusionment with
systemic politics was the ad»
ministrative slowness in
solving problems. Robinson
maintained that if only we
would view social illnesses
such as racism, poverty, etc.
in the broadest sense, we
would perceive the tremen-
dous progress made over the
last couple of decades.

”Don't be so impatient with
slowness," said he, "that it
turns you off and you walk

 

The Scarlet and Black

away"~We should, then, be
patient and work within estab'
lished political channels to
make the changes we feel
necessary.

Certainly, l wouldn’t expect
Mr. ,Robinson 0 spew different
bull, but I nOte a general lack
of comprehension of the col-
lective student mind (whatever
that is). Mr. Robinson seemed
to think that students simply
felt all politics was "dirty
business" and turned their
heads in moral indignation. He
couldn't seem to accept the
fact that the reason for dis-
illusionment lay in more pro*
found analysis.

Students are likelysomewhat
naive but 1 would assert that
this disillusionment is not
simply a reaction to LIlemOI“
ally unsanitary nature ofpoli-
tics and the slothfulness of
social progress. Perhaps Mr.
Robinson’s analysis was
somewhat simplistic in this
case. We run-ofthecmillpler
bians have as much claim to
complexity as do these hncyr
dancin’ political types,

Mr. Robinson's most in?
Structive assertion was that
party loyalty is the best vehic-
le to substantive change. “The
smart man votes a straight
party ticket,” he contended.
If a political party is unified,
he maintained, it is more able
to transmit a basicphiIOsophy

into a coherent program.
Thus, straight party vating
will do more to institute the
citizen‘s attitude than will
crossrparty voting.

Contrary to popular belief,
said Robinson, most legisla-
tors are loyal to the partyand
vote party lines. Most legisr
lation comes from party-line
voting and therefore party
philosophies play a great role
in policy making. Therefore,
asserted Robinson, the most
effective way to vete your
philosophy is to Vote the party
ticket.

In general his argument for
this point was fairly sound.
However, in order for a voter
to effectively influence policy
in the direction of his philos~
ophy of government, there
must be alternative philosr
ophies. The crucial question
becomes, then, is there an
identifiable philosophical dif
fercnce between the parties?
Mr. Robinson, answering
such queries affirmatively,
said the basic difference was
that the Democrats see Fed-
eral government as the active
force in problemrsolving and
the Republicans emphasize in»
dividual initiative and more
decentralized approach to
handling social ills. These dif-

ferences had been blurred by
the advent of television came
paigning, he claimed, where
the emphasis is more onparty
differences in policy ape
preach.

Robinson admitted thatitwas
difficult to identify philosophic
cal disparities but suggested
that study of specific issues
would more accurately in-
dioate ideological divisions
between the parties.

He admitted thatparties were
largely organizational (as op-
posed to philosophical) units.
Further he conceded that a
candidate's need for party
stems frequently from his
need for financial support and
campaign manpower.

If one combines Robinson's
admissions that parties are
not philosophical exponents
with his statement that the
benefits a candidate derives
from a political party are not
philosophical, the inevitable
conclusion is thatparty loyalty
does net unequivocally mean
that there isa consistentideo-
logical difference between
Democrats and Republicans.
Since votingpatterns wereMr.
Robinson’s major evidencefor
these differences, his argu'
ment wobbles on precarious
ground. , »7
