Evans May Run On H alf-
Mjle Team and Crane May Gom-
pete on Mile Quartet.

In the try-outs held last Saturday
afternoon to help decide who will reps
resent Crinnell at the tenth annual
Drake Itelay Carnival in Des Moines
next Saturday the following men
placed: 220»yai'd dash, Cowden. Hass,
Captain Minty, and Vinsel; IMO: r
dash, Captain Minty, B, Hoyt, v. Dau-
benberger, and Larsen, A heavy track
made fast time impossible, the events
going in :24 and ad 1/5 respectively.

These results are not the ﬁnal factor
in deciding the personnel o fthe two
teams. since Evans may run on the
half-mile team and Crane may com-
pete in the longer race.

Gﬁlnlell Winner Last Year.

In the college section last year Crin-
nell won both die half and mile relays.
As in the past basketball season the
Maltese Cross is to travel in faster
company than formerly, being entered
for the ﬁrst time in the university
class. This fact, combined with the
lack of winter practice, makes a Grip—
nell win in either event look doubtful,
altho a place, especially in the shorter
run, is quite possible. Bad weather
has kept the aspirants indoors most
of the time. ‘

In practice the 220 men have been
lining up in this way: Hass. Vinsel,
and Captain Minty, with Cowden as
anchor man, while the lib quartet has
been running: Ciane, Daubenbefger.
Hoyt, Minty.

Bass and Cowdcn are both entered
in the special invitation Idoeyai-d dash
and will compete if the weather is good
,on Saturday.

DR..DZDRA DAVIS PDINTS DUT
OPPORTUNITIES OE MINISTRY

Dr. Ozora Davis, prcsidcnt of the
Chicago Theological Seminary, spoke
in the club room of Building Four Mun-
day night on the subject of “The Press
ent Call and Claim of Deﬁnite Chris
tian Leader-ship

”The remedy for the present church
unrest,” he said, ”Is not a change of
creed but the leadership of dedicatcd
personality." He admitted that the
church was a human i ‘utmiun in
many ways and had its failings but he
denied that it should be condemned on
this account. -

He showed the opportunity which
the ministry offered to men who felt
this to be their life calling and who
could meet the high requirements of
the profession.

Class Series To Be Arranged If
Men Show Interest, Accurol~

Present indications point to the factl
that some sort or a revival of the
national pastime may be experienced
in Crumcll this year. Interest in
IVal' ' baseball has been dead here,
for several years, but a revival of LlleI
class sport seems imminent.

In all probability a class series will‘
be arranged for, according to Coach
"Chuck” Hoyt, who states that if
enough uicn show interest in the
Isport a “F. T.” baseball class will be
formed. A few men have already sig-
nihed their desire for such a class,
and more are expected to sign ip.
Credit will be given in physical traili-
ing, the men taking part in some other
sport on days when the diamond is
not in shape.
