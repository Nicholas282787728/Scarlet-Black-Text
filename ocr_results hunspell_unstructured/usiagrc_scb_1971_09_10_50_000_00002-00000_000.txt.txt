Films Program Open To Requests

by Jim Skarzynski

This year‘ 5 film chairman,
Laurie Levatin, hopes that
increased student participar
tion in film selection and
criticism will help make the
films program a success. She
hopes that any interested stu-
dents will bring her their ideas
and suggestions so the films
shown at Grinnell will meet
with student approval. Only
through student feedback, she
feels, can a good films pro*
gram be developed.

However, two serious draw-
backs are inherent in the col*
lege film program. The first
is money. The committee was
only given $5000. This sum
begins to appear very small
when the cost of films is
considered. Some films can
easily run into hundreds of
dollars.

Secondly, student requests
might be somewhat hampered
by the difficulty in obtaining
certain films. For example,
Laurie has spent some time
looking for "Don't Look
Back", a musical documene
tary about Bob Dylan.

This weekend the film pres
gram will begin in earnest
with the Bergman weekend,
Although Laurie felt that
"heavy" films should be in-
terspersed throughout the
year, a special price for the
three films induced the film
committee to show the three
films on one weekend.

The three films to be shown
are often described as a re
ligious trilogy. However, Lau-
rie feels they more closely
describe man's relationship
to himself, his society, and
God. The three films are
”Wild Strawberry" (1958), a
story about a dour old man
reviewing his life, "Seventh
Seal" (1956), Bergman’s ac
count of man's search for
meaning in life, and ”Winter
Light" (1962) Bergman’s at-
tempt to define man's rela-
tionship to God.

Other films this month in-
clude "East of Eden", 3 film
about the last part of the no
vel by John Steinbeck;
"Breathless," Godard's first
full length film; "The Bicy~

cle Thief,"a film conveying
the relationship betweena man
and boy; and Hitchcock's first
American film, "Rebecca."
A more complete description
of these films is found in the
pink bulletin distributedby the

Films Committee.

Laurie hopes other filmswill
explore several broad areas.
China, to be shown in N07
Vember, and The Battle Al-
giers, an October film, will
explore some political ques~
tions.

Other October films include
three children’s tales. Hand in
Hand is a British film about
the relationship betweena Ca—
tholic and Jewish child. Gol-
den Fish is the story of a
boy and his pet,agold.fish, and
Black Tights is a film con~
raining four short ballets. Song
to Remember, the biography
of Chopin, will also be shown
in October. Beginning in Octo-
ber, one installment ofa Flash
Gordon series will be shown
each week until the end of
the semester.

Other films Laurie is plan—
ning: The Hunchback of Notre
Dame; Marx Brothers films;
classic silent movies;musical
and political documentaries;
The Magician, another film by
Bergman; works by Hitchcock;
and short films such as the
1968 Academy award winner
The Critic.

Laurie again stresses the
facr that students can to a
great extent mold the films
program.

Off-Campus Housing Rights Explained

"Know your lease" was the
general lesson to be learned
from the meeting in the South
Lounge last Tuesday on the
problems of off‘campus non-
college housing. The meeting,
organized by coordinator
Terry Clifford, was designed
to acquaint students with the
legl aspects of leasing off
campus housing and involved
college attorney Rick Bier-
man in an hour long question
and answer period. About
twenty students attended.

Students living off campus
in the past have had various
conflicts and complaints. This
year’s sizeable offcampuspoe
pulation (over 200 students
live in non-college housing)
may be faced with more pro-
blems.

Major points brought out at
Tuesday's meeting were:
landlords can place limita-
tions on housing concerning
conduct and practices in the
apartment, but this must be
in the lease or agreed upon
previously; a landlord cannot
discriminate on the basis of
race, creed, or color, but
he (an refuse to rent to spe
cial groups like college stu~
dents; students must abide or
pay on a twelve month lease
even if they only live in Gri-
nnell for nine months; and the
Justice of the Peace can act

2 September 10, 1971

as a small claims court in
some disputes.

Following the meeting, Terry
met with students to plan a
housing evaluation which will
be conducted by the Student
Coordinator’s office. They
hope to gather sufficient in-
formation and assist students
on off campus housing prac-
tices next year, and possibly
coordinate action to bring ab-
out changes in certain housing
policies. Any comments or
complaints an be referred to
the coordinator's office, and
any questions involving lease
ing practices or legal-
ities should also be referred
to Terry Clifford, whowill ob
tain answers and explanations
from Mr. Bierman.

Additional points brought out
were that tenants are pro-
tected by their leases and
a landlord must find where a
tenant has broken the lease
before he can evict a tenant.
Also, unless there is a clae
use in the lease concerning
sale, the lease will remain
valid if the building is sold.
If repairs are provided for in
the lease, they must be made.

The lease contains 'most of
what is important to the te-
nant and he should know it
well. Additional points or
technicalities can always be
obtained from Mr. Bierman
through Terry Clifford.

The Scarlet and Black

by Janet Shuldiner

Piece by piece, a turn of
the century printingpress was
transported from Professor
John Keeble's home to the
basement of Steiner Hall last
Saturday morning.

In previous years, Mr. Knee

, ble has personally used the

press but now Grinnell stu-
dents will be involved in ev-
ery phase, from planning and
writing to setting the type and
lubrimting the press.

Capable of producing 11" x
14" pages, the printing press
can turn out pamphlet size
papers at a rate of twenty
pages a minute. Mr. Keeble
estimates one thousand to fif-
teen hundred copies ofa twelve
page issue would cost one hun-
dred dollars to print.

Presently financial assis-
tance is being sought from
various departments and founr
dations. Contributions are urn
gently needed to finance the
initial investment of paper,
ink, and plates.

Big Cheese

After a series of meetings
during the first two weeks of
school, a nebulous printing
organization has been institue
ted. Michelle Huneven is ac-
ting in the capacity of "big
cheese." In this position she
will be responsible for notie

fying] the others participating
t e printing project and,
ultimately, incorporating the
talents of the participants to
product the paper.

Exact details such as con—
tent and policy have barely
been discussed. Numerous
suggestions have been pro-
posed and as it now appears
the periodical will be fluid
in format. It will meet the
needs of its readers and con-
tributers by remaining amor-
phous and adapting consnantly
according to each situation.

Experiment

Many involved in this pres
ject are interested in the ac»
tual use of the hand printing
press as an artistic venture.
They hope to experiment with
various techniques and de-
velop methods for reprodu~
cing graphics of high quality
and possibly printing with
more than one color ink.
Since actual plans are so
vague, only a few suggestions
have been thrown around.
Among these ideas are pro-
posals for includingphotog‘rar
phic work, linoleum cuts, co-
mics, and even the possibilir
ty of making one page, lowV
cost posters to sell. All re-
venue from the sale of these
posters would go to meeting
the costs of the original sup~
plies.

Community Day: "Sacrament”

by Craig Murphy

A few years ago, the na-
tional media characterized the
relationship between the Grin~
nell community and the Cole
lege as approaching a state
of open warfare. Community
Day, now planned for October
2, is an attempt to demon-
strate to the town that the one
tire Grinnell Community, in-
cluding the College, can work
together as an integrated
whole.

The Community Day effort
is planned early in the year,
so it will not conflict with
midrsemester examinations.
Its organizers also believe
that the weather is more like-
ly to be favorable; rain post-
poned the work of 100 student
volunteers last year. Tlieyhad
intended to paint the exteriors
of homes in the city; instead,
some students were used to
help renovate interiors of
homes on Community Day, and
the outdoor projects were or
tended throughout the week.

Formative Stage

Chris Nielsen, director of
alumni affairs, stated that
plans for this year’s Com'
munity Day are still in the
formative stage. The Environ-
mental Committee ofthe Com-
munity Planning Council has
been asked to advise Commu-
nity Day planners on what is
needed.

Previously, Students have
helped to replace trees dar
maged by Dutch Elm Disease,

and to clear and mow vac-
ant lots.

Besides making Grinnell
more beautiful, such action
can also act as an impetus
for civic action. The areas
cleared last year were in
low income districts that had
been neglected by the city.
Once the garbage was moved
by Community Day workers,
the town made a commitment
to keep thelots clear ofweeds.
One of the program’s spon‘
sors, Father Michael Tan
Creti of St. Paul's Episcopal
Church, stated that the pro»
gram made apparent to some
people serviced that they sho-
uld expect and demand.

injustice

Most important, theprogram
assures that the College and
the town will not forget that
they are one community. It
shows the students that even
in the confines of a small
town like Grinnell, the prob
lems of housing, poverty, the
aged and social injustice exr
ist.

In Grinnell, however, they
exist on a small enough scale
so the efforts of a few can
have a visible impact. The
Community Day program is
not expected to solve all of
Grinnell's problems; it is on-
ly a demonstration ofthe com—
mitment to do so. Father Tan
Creti calls it a "kind of Se-
crement, an outward sign that
unity really exists in Grine
nell to solve common prob-
lems.”

Plan Fluid Format Periodical

The enthusiasticworkers rec
present a diverse group of
Grinnell students, freshmen
through seniors. Mr. Keeble
is the only member of the
group who has had enough
experience with this type of
press to be able to operate
it, so he will teach the rest
of the group.

He estimates it will take two
months before everyone will
be proficient enough to pro—
duce a modest publication,
since everything must be done
manually except for powering '
the press.

Undergrounds

In the past few years seve-
ral underground papers have
sprung up from within the
Grinnell community. Many up-
per classmen can still vividly
remember the now defunct
“Pterodactyl” and the conr
troversies that resulted from
its content.

The masterminds behind the
"Pterodactyl," Henry wu-
helm and Krystyna Neuman,
and the many others who con-
tributed to its pages pro»
duced a radical issues oriented
paper which filled a void in
Iowa as well. as the Grinnell
campus. Many legal difficule
ties pursued Henry and Kry-
styna after different issues
were distributed.

After being arrested with
three others for selling obi
scene material, Krys pursued
the issue in the courts and
won her case, overturning a
portion of Iowa’s laws concer-
ning pornography in the pres
cess. As of yet the law has
not been replaced.

Unorthodox

There were controversies
among the shaft as to policy,
and the paper lost momentum
and eventually discontinued
publicition. The "PteroV
dactyl" was succeeded by
“The High and Mighty."Some
of its workers had been inc
volved with the ”Ftero-
dactyl"; Others had broken
from “Pterodactyl” because
of a dispute over censorship
within the structure of the
paper. “The High and Migh-
ty" lasted a year but never
boasted the support the ”PIS’
rodaCtyl" had enjoyed at
times.

Unlike these other recentate
tempts, the new project will
be more flexible in its prtr
cedures. With its goal being
finding an outlet for some of
the artistic, literary, social
and political interests of stur
dents and being cognizant of
the abundant enthusiasm, one
can safely predict a rewar-
ding but unorthodox presene
tation of material.
