last weekend to evaluate last fall‘s
suggestions for an increased
multicultural presence on campus.
According to the commtttee,
Grinnell's emphasis on
multiculturalism should inﬂuence
notonly the curriculum but student
retention and the campus environ-
ment as well.

Dr. RandallMorgan,chairolthe
committee, said that the meeting
marked a transition between ade
ministrations. The committee also
moved to expand its membership to
12 in order ID include three new
members of different ethnicities.
According to Morgan, the com
mittee was pleased that action had
taken place concerning past rec-
ommendations. "There has been
significant impact on how the
Faculty Executive Council looks at
faculty recruitment and the cur-
riculum," he said. "We're also aware

of the pitfalls and difficulties of
recruitment and retention."
President Drake said that the
primary focus of the meeting was
on student retention—how to to
create a better academic environ-
ment that encourages students of
color, especially during the first
