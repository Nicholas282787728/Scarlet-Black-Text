Rocker uses education to find native roots

In high school, Suyog was that kid who
tied his long hair hock with a bondana and lis-
tened to AC/DC. But while he hendbnnged
to classic metal during rhe school year, in the
summer snyog would travel 12 hours south of
his cityskid life in Katmandu to teach science
to children in his small home village,

Since coming to Grinnell, he's exchanged
the bandana for collared shirts and has started
listening to Mark Knopfler, but suyog has yet
to ditch his characteristic workrhard, partye
hard attitude nor his desire to teach and help
others.

In the second grade, suyog started listen-
ing to Bob Marley. ln seventh grade, FM
radio stations began broadcasting in Nepal
and, by the time he reached high school, a
strong rock scene ﬂourished in Kathamandu.
“I listened to anything from the Beatles to
Led Zepplin to Black Sabbath, Metallica of
course... 1 had a nickname,‘Aqunkic.’"

Rock lyrics being notoriously incoherent
to begin with, Suyog would read the liner
notes as he listened to his favorite songs, trye
ing to figure out the English words,

When he traveled brick to his hometown
for meations and festivals, Suyog would gath-
er the village kids (most of whom were his
relatives) and teach them it few English words
or grammar rules. Other times, he would recs
ommend books, teach the kids Western eity
games like basketball or impart random facts
from his education.

“I’d gather some lenses, make a telescope
and look at Venus, tell them that Venus is a
planer, the second planet from the sun."1n
exchange, hrs little cousins would teach him
how to live Like most Nepalis do.

“When I want to
do something village-y,
something rustic, they
would tell me, ‘No, no,
you don't know how to
do it] They show me
how to beat hay, how to sow rice, there are
so many little village—y things, like taking a
shower in a waterfall, swimming in a pool
formed from the mteifnll... l mu 3 city kid,
some one to look up at.”

While it is a major Accomplishment for
any Nepali student to enroll in school in the
U.S., Suyog was more excited about the bu-
reaucratic Victory he won in obtaining a visa,

"It’s like, you are coming from a country
with terrorist problems, so maybe 15 out of
100 kids who apply will get visas."

to addition to proving he wasn’t a terror
rst, suyog had ro convince the visa committee
that he would return to Nepal someday and
also explain how he would pay for Grinnell’s
hefty tuition. For the interview, suyog cut his
classic rock hiiir,

“i actually didn’t grow my hair all rhat
long, my mother wouldn’t let me do that
because in Nepal, there was time when police
would pull you over and cut your hair."

Arriving in America would be a social
transformation ror suyog, "When i came
here, I came with such an open mind. I was

the hyperactive kid, like running around with
not much to do.I rnmn,l probably had home-
work to do that i just didn’t get done." Back
in his Nepali high school, there was a rela-
tively strict separation of genders and Suyog
thinks most Grinnel-
lians would be shocked
to discover he never
dated anyone in high
school. It didn't take
him long to relax into
Grinnell’s social scene, “And I think drinking
helped a lot."5uyog’s family in Nepal iollows
ii Hindu sect which does
not allow drinking or
smoking and he has yet
to inform them of the
lifestyle changes that led
to him founding “The
Ganja Complex" Faces
book group.

That's not Suyog’s only rounding role,
however. Only a few months ago, he created a
group to bring snidents together in support or
Nepal's democracy after Nepal’s king seizrng
absolure power. Watching the grant protests
around the world in support of Nepal, snyog
wanted to protest, too. "I felt like I should
do something, but then there’s only six ofus,
right? That's not enough. So how about we
just create awareness?"

Whilc protesters were repressed in bloody
clashes, suyog didn't find out his mom had
led a demonstration in his home village until
after the fact. “IVly parents called me and were
like, ‘Your mom led a demonstration today.’

"I’d gathersame
[eleitope and look at Venus.”

And I was like, ‘Wow. t was kind of sod,l
was drunk when she called."

His home village is not such a small place
anymoreAiter getting electricity when suyog
was in sixth grade, the rural village has leaped
in size, “When I think about it, it was prev
ty prrmitive. But now, things have changed,
there are probably so computers there now

,, Some ofthc changes are really good, rhere
were people like all over Nepal in the streets
, ir was not centralized in the capital. 1 am
really happy that people are more aware now
because ofthe media, through the tnrernet
and (lic FM stations."

While he still blasts
music in the Russian
house kitchen and
supplements his srudies
with ample partying,
Suyog plans to keep
on an academic path
after he graduates, reaching science at a prie
vare school in Minnesota tor a year and rhen
rcrnarnrng in the United states to pursue a
PhD in Physics "I'm too romimllc, too much
reading about Einstein when I was a kid i
just want to understand stuffhcciiusc nobody
else does, Likc there’s quantum mechanics
7 there’s some interesting srnii going on but
you really don't know what’s going on, Ir's like
going to a Catholic mass."

After rhar, as promised in thc visa intern
view, he’ll return to the city streets and wa»
terfiills of Nepal. “1 want to go back and work
for Ncpnlt I want to nor as a liaison berween
Nepal and the rest ofthc world."
