A 271 victory over Monmouth College last Sun-
day provides some momentum for the Pioneers going
into this weekend’s match with perennial conference
stalwart Lake Forest.

“Lake Forest is the only team I haven’t beat since
I’ve been at Grinnell," said Lucas Hollistcr '06, “they
are almost always in the top four, so we know it will
be a tough match."

A 470 loss to Beloit (371, 171 Midwest Confer-
ence) soured Grinnell's home opener as four ditibrent
Buccaneers netted a goal a piece.

“They are picked to finish second in conference,"
Hollister said, “so we knew any points against them
would be a good result."

Sunday’s trip to Monmouth was a different story
however, as the Pioneers evened
their record'in conference play with
a H victory over the host Scots.

sisted in the 13th minute and cap-
tain Joseph Hansen ‘05 recorded
the game winner in the 73rd. The
Pioneers outshot the Scots 25-14
as Hansen's goal capped a persistent eight-shot effort.
i—lansen, a senior captain, has either scored or assisted
on four ofthe team’s six goals to date.

At 171 in the conference the Pioneers look to get
above .500 when Lake Forest comes into town this
Saturday, Sept. 25.The Foresters are coming offa 2-2

the NCAA Division III record for the quickest goal
scored in a game, as she netted the Scots’ fiist goal at
0:10 in the first half. Grinneil would surrender two
more goals in the 9th and 12th minutes before Rachel
Moskowitz scored in the 55th minute off a corner
kick from sister Kara.

Macalestcr moves to 5-1, the one setback coming
in overtime against the University of Chicago, 2003
NCAA D' sion 111 runnersup.

Following their 10~0 shellacking of Knox on
Tuesday, the Pioneers (now 5-2, 2-0 MWC) have al-
lowed only tour goals in seven games, all before the
18th minute, and have allowed the opposition only 25
second-half shots in those games.

“The defense has been great this year," said goalie

Liz carrier ‘07. “They have been especially strong at
aggressively winning balls in the air."

Carrier herself has becn strong between the pipes,
as the Midwest Conference named her Defensive
Player of the Week on Sept. 13.

Sixtheyear eoaeh Heather Benning continues to
stress skills that the women will need in a run at the
NCAA tournament.

“We’ve been working on having a quick touch
on the ball and one and two-touch passing,” Carrier
said, “and continuing our focus on playing llaman
defense."

A large turnout is expected for the home match
against Lake Forest which begins at 11 am on Sat-

If the team can raise accountability on defense

Lake Forest, Hollister said, “there’s no reason why we

The Pioneer football team scored seven touch—

48—35 victory over visiting Macalesterr The Grinnell
defense gave up 473 yards of its own, but managed
to hold off the Scots long enough to seal the victory
The story of the day, however. was the performance
of Nate Wineinger ‘05. who rushed for a Grinnell
College record four touchdowns. He rumbled for 238
yards on 26 carries (second—most in school history)
and caught a 55 yard touchdown pass from Sean Pfal-

“Aftei my
third touch-

neingert“AIter the fourth one I told the offensive line
that if they would get me a fifth. I would give all five
of my pride stickers we get on our helmets to them.
They came through." Pfalzer and the offensive line
had great days, keeping the Scot defense honest and
blocking well for Wineinger all day.

“The offensive line played outstanding," said
Wineinger. “In my opinion, it was Marcus Ramirez,
our fullback, and our other receivers that helped turn
those 5-10 yard carries into big ones.When you have
the other ten guys on the ﬁeld working their back-
sides off, it is really easy to have a nice day."

The victory puts Griuncli at 271 ovcrall (lei
MWC). as they prepare to head to Jacksonville, Ill. on
Saturday to take on the Blueboys oflllinois College
(370, 270 MVVC).
