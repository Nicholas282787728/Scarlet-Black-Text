Greetings sports fans

Last week many Grinnellians
were surprised by the pret
sence of a snake swimming
in the new P.E. complex pool.
This snake isn't just an or
dinary reptile, but a South
A.merican Boa Constrictor
named Andrew Jackson Fau-
bacher. Andrew Jackson Faun
bacher (called "lax” for sho-
rt) was named for Andrew
Jackson, former president of
the United States and the Fair
bacher Beer Company, which
is located near Jax‘s place
of birth, La Place, Louisiana.
Born in February of 1970,
Jax was purchased shortly
after his birth by Grinnell
Senior Michael Daley on a
trip through Louisiana. Mike
said that Jax has a life (36
pectancy of approximately
ten-twelve years, will grow
to a length of tenttwelvc feet,
and will weigh pproximately
100 pounds. Jax is about 36-
38 inches long and has a bla-
ck and tan skin. He lives in

a terrarium which Mike says
he can inhabit tintil he rode
ches maturity. Jax enjoys can
ting mice which iiC SCiCillt'
fically smothers before inges
ting.

l-iow Jax came to swim in
the new pool is a rather int
teresting story. Mike, who is
a lifeguard at the complex,
had Jax with him one day.
lie said that most of the peat
pie who were at the pool
thought that Jax was a neat
creaturegonly a couple were
really soared. Since there
were only a few people in
the pool, Mike and Jax went
in. Jax favors a free style
form which amounts to a sort
of sinuous slithering across
the water. Jax is hopeful of
becoming the swim team mast
cot along With a raccoon.

In addition to exploiting his
pet’s swimming abilities,
Mike has plans for a ”Snake
Feed” to bc I‘iCltl in the SO"
uth Lounge of the Forum set
me line in the near future.

The idea behind a snake feed
is to see the battle between
the snake and the mice.

Mike says that from a purely
scientific standpomt snakc
feeds are interesting because
of the. way in which the mouse
is first killcdaiid then catch.
When asked about the respont
sibility of keeping a pet such
as Jax, Mike said that the
main thing is to keep the
room warm because Jax is
extremely suscepiablc to the
cold, and can easily catch
pneumonia, which is fatal to
snakes.

Mike turned on to snakes
when he was It child, but On'
ly now has he had a real
snﬂkc to call his Own. He has
plans to purchase at some
time in the near future all
of the six ”Giant" nakcs
which include (mood on to
the Boa) the Roticulatett Py'
thon, which grows toa length
of 36 feet, weighs about 350
pounds and has a girth mcn-

surcment of 17 inches. This
snake likes to eat goats and
animals of a similar nature
and is considered to be quite
dangerous.

Other snakes in the ”giant”
category include the Anaconr
(la, the African Rock Python,
the Indian Rock Python and
the \methys'lne Pytho

FB Squad Meditate: 0n Game

by Nick Russo

I’m really at a loss as to
what to say in this article
concerning the Grinnellfoot-
ball team and its upcoming
game with Monmouth this Salt
urday. I could take the in-
formative but boringapproach
of listing returning letterman
on each team, comparing ret
cords of our freshman team
last year with that of Mon-
mouth's, and then makean ed-
ucated guess as to which team
is most likely to win.

On the ether hand, I could
talk about aspects of football
at Grinnell with which you have
probably hever had any cont
tact with. For instance, dur-
ing the course of warmups,
Ed Hirsch is exrremely fond
of yelling out on the top of
his lungs some famous line of
poetry as though it was some-
thing oroginally conceived by
him. The coaching staff tries
to discourage Ed from rct
citing his poetry for fear that
its soporif‘ic nature Will u.
duce the alertness ofthe team.

Still another little known fact

is that the entireteam engages
almost every day in a torn of
transcendental meditation, or
herWise known as ”Buddha."
”Buddha” is simply an ex*
ercise that resembles the full
lotus position which is comm—
only associated with my-
stictsm. The team was not
satisifed with simply stretch-
ing their leg muscles so the
exercise was supplemented
with a rhythmic chant. »\ftcr
only four practices Bogrianno
and Gitlin achieved the state
of Sutorii

Along a more serious vcnt,
come to the game Saturday.
There'll be something thch
for everyone. For those who
are into colors, there will be
a bright blue sky contrdsled
with a rich grccn field upon
which colorful team Jerseys
will bC found. And for those
of you who simply enjoy war
ching good football, l’tn sure
you will be as satisfied as the
color freaks. Also, if HHY’
one is into watching a beau~
tiful Doberman Pincher,
there’ll be one at the game.

After losing all of his top
runners, Coach Ray Obermilr
lcr may have been worried
about his cross country team.
But he isn’tworriedany more.
Grinnell’s first meet with
Simpson, Coe, and Faith Bap-
tist Bible College wasn't {We
on a fair contest. Grinnell
grabbed nine of the top fifteen
places, and could have thnC a
lot better, as several top
flight runners were injured.
The freshman runners pro-
vided the winning effort with
six of Grinnclt's lop nine.
The outstanding performer
of the meet was Chuck Me
Grath. Who else could it have
been7 He was so far ahead
of everyone else that he
couldn’t even be secn by the
second place runner. His \vim
ning time was 15:13.5 over the
three mile distance. All of
the other Grinnell runners

turned excellenttimcsas well.
They wcreJohn Hessoerg, this
rd place, 16.28; Dan Hilde
brand, fourth, 16 'Robert
Tenncn, fifth, 16 7, PauiMli’

eleventh, 17.23; Terry Seer

Holvland, fourteenth, l7' -
Bob Shields, fifteenth, 17.3 ;
John Fleckenstein, [Wenty’se’
conti. 18:37; Chris Madson,
who broke the pole vaulter’s
cross country record by pla-
cing twenty-third with a time
of 18:44; Phil Morales, twent
tytfourth, 19:70; and Bruce
Morrison, ihil‘iy’second, 22:
43.

Grinnell will compete this
Saturday against Coe, William
Penn, and Monmouth Colleges.
There will be little doubt that
Grinnell will be the Victor,
but the meet should prove an
important SIGPPingtstone to
the leagnie championship meet.

The Grinnell soccer team,
that small but dedicated group
of scholar~athletes, has spent
the last two weeks preparing
for their first game of the
year. The initial event will
occur in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
as the Grinnell squad encoun-
ters the pride of Goo Colt
lege.

Coach Keith Fisher's team,
though hurt by the graduar
tion of several fine players,
seems to have a solid core
of returnees. Heading this list
are Tom Lincoln, this year’s
captain and last year's lead
ing scorer, and Steve Korsa
tad, the second leading sect
rer last year. Others who will
carry a great part of the load
this year are Roger Kumler,
Steve Hirshon, who missed
half of last season with a
icnce injury, John Videtich,
Jeff Jordan, Levi Wood, and
Lee Edniands.

The team's weaknesses, ac-
cording to Coach Fisher, will
be at the goal-keeping posi»
tion and the outside half—back
spots. These positions will
have to be filled by inexpet
rienced players.

The two most important gar
mes in Coach Fisher's opion,
are the Knox and Beloit gar
mes. Knox is always 3 str-
ong aggressive team and is
keenly competitive. The Beloit
game, on the ether hand, ctr
uld be considered a grudge
match. Last year the Grinnell
squad was defeated 7. l by this
team.

There will be four home
games this year and the soce
cer team needs your support.
The first actionrpacked home
game will be against Knox
on September 25. So come
out and support your local
soccer teaml
