Police drop major charges against a Grinnell support staffer accused of drug
possession, but not quickly enough to save herjob at Goodnow Hall

by David Archer
On January 3]. 2005, Robyn Wiiigerrer and her two teenage sons
were arrested and iailed on an array of driigereiated charges Three
weeks later, out ofvacatiou time and still waiting ior her day in eoiirt,
the Grinnell College suppert staffer was ﬁred rrom her job of i 3 years.
This week, Wingcrter was ﬁnally cleared orail charges except tor one
misdemeanor

Aftermath

Many Grinnell {acuity and stafrworesurprised that the college did
not wait to ﬁre Wingerrer until she was actually found guilty of a
crime, The decision to his her has left members ofthe Grinnell come
munity tiiiietly questioning why the college’s administration appeared
so eager to disassocinte itselfwith her,

“We all knew that she was innocent," said a support staffer who
knew Wiiigerrer well. “it was clear to us that it would all blow over. it
would be fine,"

The stafrer addcti, however, rhnr the college offered to rcehire
Wingcrter if she were found innocent of her crimes. Administrators
postponed her termination until she had run our oivaeation time; if
they had not ﬁred her then, she would have been
unlikely to collect cither salary or unemployment
beneﬁts,

Cleared of the major allegations against her,
however, Wingerrer chose not to resume her job.

Many felt the college acted unjustly.

“We all keprsaying, ‘What happened to inno.
eciir until proven guilty " said anorhcrsrafrcr who

several raeulry members expressed similar criri.
cisms orrhe administrations actions.

“At an institution that values social iusricc, it
seems to me that “innocent until proven guilty'
should govern procedures and nor be only an ide.
aiiaed principle," said protessor Sylvia Thorsone
smith, Sociology.

The college did not immediately ﬁre Wingerrer
upon heating ofhetarrcst. Wingerrerand her sons
were served with numerous Felonyelcvel charges
including possession of and intent to distribute methamphetamine,
mariyuana and psiloeybin (mushrooms). Ofﬁcers said they found,
among other things, evidence ora merh lab in the family's garage,

Though Wingerrer was legally guilty ofnothing when she was ﬁred.
the college was nor required to explain its actions because lown's “cm-
ploymcmentewlll" law permits an employer or employee to terminate
a work contract for almost any reason, at any time.

According to sources close re rho situation, the college ﬁred herso
she could collect unemployment beneﬁts. Terminating her, therefore,
was reportedly intended to ease her ﬁnancial situation while her legal
troubles waited to be resolved.

it remains unclear who made the ﬁnal decision io ﬁre her and why
it was made.

“I know rhcre was a lotofdisciission with the college laiiycrs ahour
it," said one support staffer who knew Wiiigcrter. “it was protecting
the college's ass."

Silence

some adiiiinistrntors strongly urged support starters not to talk
about Wiiigertci’s termination, and some support staffers interpreted
those warnings ns implicit threats to their own iohs.

Since Wingcrter’s termination, the lowa courts
have dropped almost all her charges eitcept a mis»
demeanor marijuana charge to which she has pled
guilty.

Kristin Lovig, Human Resources, and Jim
Muiholland, ofﬁce of rthreasurcr, did not make
the decision to ﬁre Wingerrer but they were in.
volved in the process. Asked whether they believed
the college made the correct decision to ﬁre
Wiiigerrcr, each declined to comment.

“its best rhnr personnel issues are kept conﬁ»
dcntiali" said Lovig,

They also declined to comment when asked
whether the college gave Wingerrei a fair chance
to resolve her legal issues.

Muihoiiand did suggest that the college would
be hesitant to employ people accused of vioicnr
felonies, though he did not comment speciﬁcally
on Wingcrter's situation.

Aside from her recent arrest, Wingerter maintained a clean legal
record while working (or the college. She was well-liked by the profev
sors who worked with her in Goodnow Hall. A dispute between
Wingertcr and the administration over wages caused some waves in
the past year, but the incident passed with an agreement between the
two sides.

“Robyn has been an excellent employee with many important re.
sponsrhilities at the college," said Thorsten-Smith.

Wingcrter took classes through a program that allows employees
of thc college te take a limited number ofclasses each year. She was
slowly working toward a degree, taking one class in many semesters.
She had maintained a cumulative GPA of3.67.

“Robyn worked here about 15 years," said Maria Tapias, Anthro-
pology. who worked with Wingerter in Goodnow. “Obviously when
this happened, it was kind an big blow to the Anthio department,"

Worried staffers

The college’s handling ofWingertcr’s situation has left many sup»
port staffers worried about theii own job secuiity at the college,

“it can be unnerving foi- evciyoiie hcie, especially untemiied cme

“A ior ofpeople feel replaceable," said another,

Equipment
problems force
KDIC off the air

by J e n w a is h

Studenterun radio station KDIC went ofirhe air for
the semester Tuesday at 5 p.m., a week and a haliberore
scheduled, due to equipment troubles and problems with
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

An engineer from local radio station KGRN visited
the station this wcek and guessed the cause to be an
overheated transmitter. said KDlC Station Manager
Spencer Volkmcr-Jones '03.

“Anyone who has spent time in the KDIC studio
knows how hot it can be," he said. “We think the heat
yust got to the machines over time." These equipment
problems are probably easily ﬁxed, Volkmcr.iones said,
but there are no plans to make the repairs before this
summer.

Additionally.
the FCC “made a
routine inspection”
ofKDlC last Mon»
day, “notln anyway
prodded by any
complaints about
the station,” said
Assistant station
Manager Colin
Seiler ’03. “During
the inspection,
problems both re.
lzted and unrelated
to the engineering
issues were noted.”

Volkmcrejoncs and at least three station managers
that preceded him, along with KDIC's administrative
liaison, Associate Dean for Student Life Michael Sims,
were “unaware of certain legal issues that the FCC
brought up during the inspection,"5ei1er said.

“Nothing ofﬁciallysanctioned orlcgally compelling
has happened thus for," said Volkmcivlones. ”Eu: 1
would expect that the KDIC we have had in the past
year will be improved upon in light of these circum
stances.”

scilcr is uncertain ifKDiC will be ﬁned for the prob.
lems, bursaid changes will be made to bring thesrarion
“up to standards."

Following rhc problems with the FCC, future me
dia heads will be trained more extensively, serier said.
This training might involve outside assistance From the
FCC and others

“i think [scileri will receive a training unlike any»
thing recent station managers have experienced," said
Volkmerejones.

Both Volkmcr—ienes and seilcr relr the problems
were fixablc. “We plan to be back ﬁrst thing in the fall,"
Seller said.

“Those in the administration i have spoken with
value KDICs presence on rho campus, and i don’t be»
i‘ieve that anyone would appreciate the loss ofrhc radio
station,” Volkmeteiones said.

Changes to the station will not occur this semester
“i imagine that most of the changes will occur dur-
ing the summerand early next semester,"Volkmcr.ioiies
said. “The implications of the last few days will rake
longer than the next two and n halrvvceks to fully ﬁgure
out,”

Meanwhile, voting for Kch Dickie awards oc-
curred in the post ofﬁce yesterday. The winners will be
announced tonight at 5 pm. on Cleveland Beach (or in
Gardner in case orrain).

“I would expect that
the KDIC we have
had in the past year
will be improved
upon in light of
these circumstances.”
