Fire Escapes
Chief Charge
Of Inspectors

By Ken MncCowan

“Fire escapes on men’s dor-
mitories are obviously in as poor
condition as any serving school
property in the state of Iowa,"I
said one of the group of fire in-
spectors under the leadership of
L. w, Rolland, Secretary of the
State Fire Prevention Associa-
tion, who investigated fire haz-
ards in Grinnell yesterday.

Mr, Fred Meister, branch man-
ager of the Travelers’ Fire in-
surance Co., made this statement
about the women’s Quad: ”The
system whereby the fire escapes
of Cleveland, James, Haines, and
Read empty into closed courts
and then back into the loggia is,
almost as bad as no iire escapes
at all.”

Mr. Meister recomended that
the college discontinue the use
of the third ﬂoor of Pine Tree
as a dormitory.

Dean Strong and Mr. L. v.
Phelps, treasurer, extended the
invitation' for the investigation
of the college. The State Fire
prevention Association, in its
yearly investigation of eight
towns, contacts the Chamber of
Commerce for cooperation. After
its investigation, the association
makes recommendations for im-
provement. ,

The investigators made rec-
ommendations that the college
install additional fire escapes on
the east end of Main hall and on
Cowles.

Suggestions were also made
that fire break doors be placed
in the tunnel under the north
campus loggia to stop fires rac-
ing from hall to hall. The trans-
formers at the end of the tunnel
should be enclosed in a steel
fireproof vault, the investigators
said and the fire escapes now in
existence should be repaired if
they need it.

GRINNELL COLLEGE. GRINNELL. IOWA. FEBRUARY l8, H749

Open Letter To President Stevens

Dear Dr. Stevens:
4

At several meetings with students recently you took issue with arbitrarily impos-
ed authority, urging students to voice dissent openly when they felt that unjust eon-
conditions existed on the campus, and extending the provocative invitation to come in

and “blast hell out of me!”

In light of your willingness to accept'criticism of the administration of student raf-
fairs, we of a student-organized wages and employment committee would like to make

public our dissatisfaction with the results of two conferences with you on the employ-

ment question.

You gave its the statement that, “Our wage structure is fully competitive and in
many instances premium with student wages in other colleges and universities.”

We feel that a comparison of our wages with those paid in other schools is unfair
unless El, comparison of total costs of room and board is also included

Looking over data which you gave us on room and board rate charges in 168 pri-
vate and endowed colleges. we found that the average monthly rate for single rooms

is $26.80 (we are charged $35).

For double rooms the average charge is $17.47 per

person (we pay $35), and for rooms housing three or more students the average rate is

$16.53 (we still pay $35).

The average weekly board rate, according to these statis-

tics, is $9.59. .Grinnell students pay $11.90 for their meals.

Judging from these figures, it would seem that not only can no fair comparison of
wages be made without including them, but that also Grinnell students might find a legi»
timate gripe in the fact that on this campus the same rate is charged for all three types

of housing facilities. .

Second, we can find no record that kitchen and Union jobs held by high school
students at 500 per hour plus meals have ever been offered on the same basis to college

students.
Third,

we were given no definite statement on exactly how the profits admittede

1y made in the dining rooms (which we would like to see returned to the students in the
form of higher wages) are used to make up a deficit in housekeeping expenses. An ex-
amination of the books and a mimeographed financial statement distributed to each hall
and including a breakdown of dormitory running expenses would give the students a
clearer and_more satisfying explanation of how their money is spent.

In answer to your objection that the group which met to talk with you was not

truly representative, we explain again that the committee

included repl'esentativesi

from the Student Council, the waiters in the Quadrangle and Cowles dining rooms, and

the S & B.

In conclusion, we do not yet agree

that, as you suggest, general dissatisfaction

with student employment stems mainly from troublesome human problems, On the con-
trary, we are adult: enough to recognize that the biggest problem involved is economic,‘

and that it will not be solved by circumlocution, specious arguments,

platitudes.

The controversy over the folk
song has raged for a long time.
Opinion has too long held sway.
One must understand the Ger-
manic spirit, the French spirit,
the irish and the English spirit
to receive anything from these
songs. In each song are found
the qualities of the people from
whom the songs have sprung.
They are as indigenous to their
lands as is a country’s literature.
It is from such music as we
heard Bennet perform that the
composer comes into existence.
There can be little doubt of the
beauty of such songs as “Green
Sleeves,” or the Schubert “Wo-

“The reason folk songs and folk singers have disappeared
from our musical scene," said Richard Dyer-Eennet, “is that any~

In order to bring the spirit, the essence of

It is in this same light that

Certainly those who put forth
