TL‘o‘I’ER ADDRESS

By Ill’vcl'cilll Bttl'i'cll o/ Des Mollwi.
1794151017041 Idea of Nectl of Purity
[it Life.

A decidedly pleasing yespur address
was made last Sunday by Rec. Mr. Burr
ling, pastor at Greenwood Congl‘egzb
tioual church at Des Memes. Mi-
Hurling is an alumnus oi Grillnell coir
lege.

The speaker, though hampered by a
severe cold, was quite interesting and
he developed nell the thought that
sympathy with the weaknesses and sins
or humanity is not to be gained by
personul experience but through pur-
ity. Although many have passed
through these personal experiences or
sin and proﬁted by them, yet the One
who most completely understood hu-
ntarlit) and all the wealtnesses was the
purest of all, Jesus.

For the prelude and postlude Protes
sor llatlack played two numbers or
Gilililmnt, “consolation" and a folk-
song, The choir sang an anthem on
the 39th Psalm by Bortnianslii.
