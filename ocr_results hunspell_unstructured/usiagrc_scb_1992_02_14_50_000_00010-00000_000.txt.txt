MORAN: What has B
and G done with Ben?

asked, a little confused. “l-Ie’s prob
ably over at Il-IOP getting stoi“

”No, not.” he interrupted, franti»
Cally waving his hands. “It's notthat!
Our SA. and some guys on second
just saw two B and G guys carrying
him away,stillsleepingl They packed
him into their truck and took off to
wards the Physical Plant!”

Istaredathim,aghast. “Youmean
they took him away because he was
sitting out in the lounge unattended?”

“It’s those new fire hazard regula-
tions!,“ Alan walled. “Monday they
got my tennis shoes that were drying
out in the hall. then yesterday they
picked up some girl’s hamsters, and
now I think they took Ben!"

I thought as fast as I could—
clearly, this was trouble.

“We’d better Call B and G,“ I rear
soned. ”They’ll probably let us go
pick him up.”

Alan’s eyes were frantic, like the
eyes of a hunted beast. “I don’t want
to be next!” he said, wildly. “I’m
afraid to sit down!”

“Why don’t I call,” I suggested,
ﬁrmly shouldering the responsibilty.
Clearly was Alan was in no shape to
deal with any coldvhearted De Capos
of the B and G. Grabbing my direc-
tory. I scanned the names, Physical
plant, physical plant...

“Hello, physical plant," a clear

voice answered.

“Urn, hello thisisLaura Moran up
on Dibble third. “ I said, trying to
sound as adult as possible. “I‘m call»
ingaboutsomethingthatwasremoved
from our lounge.”

“Personal items of students left
out are removed by B and G because
of fire hazard regulations," the dis
embodied voice droned. betraying no
emotion. "Students may pick up their
belongings at the physical plant be-
tween eight and-"

“We call him Ben," I interjected,
attempting to make our absent friend
into more of an individual. and not
just another miscellaneous “personal
item". “I-Ie’sa friendly little guy, but
every now and then he just dozes
off—"

“—and students will be expected
to keep common areas clear from
then on. Thank you.” Click.

I hung up, and turned to break the
bad news to Alan.

“They’ve got him," I reported,
grimly. “He'sprobably shutupin the
Physical Plantbasement, being forced
to grind out new copies of mail box
keys with his teeth.” I paused, recon-
sidering. “Or you know, he was kind
of artistically inelincdi maybe
they’ve got him painting flames on
those little red scooters."

Alan turned pale. “But they can't
just remove things from our living
rooms!," he protested

“Be reasonable, man,” I told him,
shaking my head regretfully. “He
was a clear-cut fire hazard. Remem-
ber what happened to his bangs the
last time he tried to light a bong?"

“I guess you’re right," Alan con-
curred with reluctance, “But it still
doesn‘t seem fair. Those OCCO
houses get to have giant inﬂatable
dinosaurs in their lounges.“

“Dinosaurs don’t smoke," I
pointed out, sagely, “And remember
how dry and brittle Ben tends to get in
this indoor heat."

We sat, silently contemplating the
fate of our friend imprisoned in the
physical plant, beside piles of pun-
gent tennis shoes and savage. starv-
ing hordes of captured hamsters.

“Maybe that’s what happened to
those freshmen that everybody
thought dropped out...” I mused, “I
mean, didn't the attrition rate sky-
rocket last semester?”

Steps were proceeding up the
stairsi the maid was coming in to
clean.

I stretched. with a yawn. “Well,
you want to crash out in the lounge
and drink a cup of coffee or some-
thing?”

Alan looked at me, and we both
though about what I’d just said.

“Actually," I corrected myself,
nervously, “inever mind."

did cannot be diluted to being any-
thing less than evil.

The natural reaction for most
people will be to explain, “Well, of
course he was guilty ofrapc. l-Iisjob
is to beat people up. how much fur-
ther did he have to go?" This is damn
gerous reasoning,

Undoubtedly the violence of Mike
Tyson's job, for which he was paid
millions ofdollars, contributed to his
crime. But to claim that rape was a
natural extension of hisjob serves l0
make the possibility of rape alien to
men who are not involved in violent
contact sports. The overwhelming
majority of athletes in contact sports
are not rapists. There are a few cone
spicuous ones who are. Similarly,
not all white males in busmess suits
are rapists either. There are some less
conspicuous ones who are- probably

more than are professional athletes
Yet, the potential for rape exists mall
of these men and in everyone in be
tween who bears a Y-chromosome,

This problem is not solved by tryr
ing to de-program men from wanting
to participate in or observe contact
sports sitch as boxing, hockey and
football, Participation in rough con-
tact sports does not a rapist make.
Just look at how popular women’s
rugby is on this campus among many
feminists. Regardless of what those
who theoriaeon masculinity say. rape
can only be stopped when men learn
some simple facts.

No means no, Whethcritis said at
the firstadvahcc or aftera deep. long
passionate kiss: or in a limousine at
two in the morning. A person always
reserves the rightto say no. Thatgocs
for both women and men. I have yet
to hear medical evidence that says
that athletes are less capable of un-

ticrstandingthcword no ’Norhavc
I heard that “new" tnen who rcatl
Robert Blv' S ”Iron [olln five LIITICS
areanybetteratcoinprehending“ no
There is no reason why Mike Tyson
should have been any less c ' blc of
understanding the word "no.’

As for Mike Tyson. maybe we will
finally learn that we can’t hold up
figures ol'popcillturo to heroic mode
cls silnply because of their athletic
success. There are probably basket-
ball players who sat the bench for the
entire season who could be as worthy
arolemodelasMichaclJordan, How
ever, I wouldn‘t hold my breath until
these “pine-riders" are held up for
oiVic admiration

It is a scary world we live In; our
heroes are mortal, our leaders are
shallow, our air is poisoned and our
relations are strained. Justice has
been done to Mike Tyson. May we
learn from it.

WEST: Tearing down the patriarchy

African and African-American com-
munity, but from the whites. The
swastikas abound, even if you don’t
write them, even if you don‘t speak
them. you can still think them. Of
course the same theory applies to

sexism. I really don't care ifyou talk
about tearing down the patriarchy.
Do something. Political dogma is
great if you act upon it. If you don’t,
don‘tbother. Don’tcven talk about it
because you’re wasting all of our
time. Do something—or in this case
don’t. Self-deﬁned sensitive men,

this is the time todo something. Sup-
port someone who docsn‘t look like
you. act like you, or think like you
Be daring. Better yet: Don’t run for
