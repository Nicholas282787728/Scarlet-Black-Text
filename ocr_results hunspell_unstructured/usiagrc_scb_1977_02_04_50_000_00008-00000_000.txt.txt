A Visit to the doCtor

by Mark Mayer
and Tom Panzer

“You know, sometimes I get the
feeling that a lot of students think
they could get a new body just by
requisitioning one,” Dr. Robert M.
Carney said, leaning back in his
chair. “You got to take care of the
bod . . . that’s what I keep telling
them, take care of the bod. You eat
all the time. you're going to get fat,
You quit eatingI you’re going to get
skinny. You study 40 hours straight
and you're going to have
problems.“

After six years in Grinnell, Dr.
Robert M. Carney has acquired a
number of interesting perspectives
on life in a small Iowa college
town. The 5&3 talked to him about
his views on living in Iowa, the
medical profession, college

. students, and his past,

“Ittakes a special kind of person
fora small town practice," he said_
“You have to want that personal
interaction with your patients . , , I
like the people here. They're
basically down to earth and sin-
cere. That's really what Iowa has
going for it. , . the people."

“or course you’re on call 24
hours a day, every day, and it’s
difficult to find free time. Do you
know when I last had time to sit
down and reada book", I don’t even
have time for my poetry any

 

more,” he laughed and pointed to a
“My

framed poem entitled,
Brother's Keeper," He recited the

poem from memory, “I've got no

plans to leave though,” he said, “I
guess medicine is my life,"

From a Hawaiian military
career of “saluting and playing
tennis," to “sneaking in the back
door of med school," from being
kidnapped and shot by his ex»wife,
to being written up in Lite and The
New York Times, Carnev certainlv
has led an interestinz lite, “Really,
some of the things I could tell you
would blow your mind,..my
personal history reads just like
Rootsr”

Carney first came to Iowa as an
intern at Mercy Hospital in Cedar
Rapids. After his internship,
Carney attempted to set up
practice in Stubenville, Ohio. his
home town. But, as he describes it,
“the case of the small town boy
makes good” wasn't going to
materialize in Ohio. ”I never even
unpacked my U-haul,” he Said. “I
remembered all those people in
Cedar Rapids telling us how badly
they needed doctors in Iowa so I
came right back.” That was in 1959
and Dr. Carney hasn‘t left since.
He immediately took over a vacant
practice in Brooklyn and held that
position until 1970 when he moved
to Grinnell.

"This is my child whom I have left in your care. ‘

Take him, look at him, love him . . . Feed him, cleanse him,

take care of him. Use him but please don't abuse him . . .

and if by chance he is broken, you may even try to repair him . . .

but whatever you do . . . whenever you are through . . .

Return him to me.”

"My reception in Brooklyn was
fine.” he said. “We registered over
one hundred families that first
week They really needed a doc-
tor,“

Carney says that the college was
one of the main reasons he moved
to Grinnell, but now he is usually
too busy to come on campus for
other than medical reasons,
Generally, he finds the students “1i

joy" to know and talk lo, but Ieels *
that they are still pretty naive

about life "A lot of students come
here without asking themselves the
questions: Why are you ilere‘.l Do
you want to grow up here?" he
said.

“what kind of serious physical
problems can you have?”

Carney feels that a certain
segment of Grinnell students take
work too seriously, "They get into
making the grade and never learn
how to live. they neverlearn how to
deal with people.” he said. “It gets
to 2i point where l have to say,
come on now, grow up. This is the
real world."
