College Theatre‘s first
mainstage production, Vinegar Tom,
will open. Wriuen by Carlehurchill,
this play deals with issues that are as
pertinent today as they were at the
time that it is set. About witches and
the witch craze that occurred during
the 15th, 16th and 17lh centuries, this
play is also about the misogyny that
existed during the burnings and con-
tinues to this day.

who were uncenain. The work of
these village healers overlapped with

archal societies, scared of women
who wielded such power, used witch
persecution as a means of eliminat»
ing them. It is no coincidence that it
was during the birth time of healing

Ferguson experiences
all aspects of Grinnell

S getenoughofGrinnell,andJ.

Carlos Ferguson is deﬁnitely
one of them. The resident
printmaking and drawing professor
this semester has seen the college
from every differentperspective, ﬁrst
growing upinGrinnell,thengraduat-
ing from the college, and now teach-
ing at his alma mater.

Carlos graduated in 1992, and
since then has earned a degree in
Prinunaking from the University of
Iowa. Interestedin gaining some teach-
ing experience, he got in touch with
Tony Crowley, the printmaking pror
fessor at Grinnell, who is currently on
leave. He learned from Crowlcy that
the college was looking for someone
to take ovcr printmaking and drawing
classes for the first semester, and tile
perfect match was made.

Thus for. teaching has been an
exciting, if somewhatexhausting, ex-
pcncnccforFerguson, “I'mlhrilled to
have this opportunity, and I‘m loamy
ing a lot from the students,” he coma
merited. “The main difference be—
tween being a student and a teacher,
mough, is that teaching is a lot more
work 7 it requires preparation for

class, teaching class, meetings 7 the
list goes on and on."

Ferguson sees being relatively
youngasanadvanlageforhisposition,
saying, “I feel like I can relate to slur
dents because I'm so close to them in
age,andI’vebeenlntheirpositiontoo.
After the first few days ofclass, all of
my students were calling me Carlos,
and it was ajust a natural thing.” In
fact, he says that he is often mistaken
for a student when walking around on
campus,

Althoughinaeompletcly differ-
ent situation now, Carlos says not
much has changed in his few years
away from campus. The Harris Cen—
ter was builtand has taken overas the
collcgc center for social activities,
but according to Ferguson, "the stu
dentsarestillthesatnetypcsofpcoplc,
and life is about the same,"

After completing his semester
here at Grinnell, Carlos hopes to utkc
some time off and practice his art,
then go back to school and earn a
Master of Fine Arts degree in
Printmaking. Hcis consideringtcachr
ing as a career, and thisexpcriettce is
helping him to make that decision
about his future. Who knows? In
another few years we tnight once
again be seeing ). Carlos Ferguson
back at Grinnell, this time for good.
