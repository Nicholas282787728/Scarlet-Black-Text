Rallies Latte.

Outplaylng their rivals at every
turn, the Pioneers defeated Cuc college
in easy fashion in a. game on the local
court “lednesday night, by a score of
28 to 15. The Grinnell quintet Was in
possession of the basil practically all
the time, and was never in danger of
being header].

During the early minutes of play,
the Pioneers uncorked a brand of
teamwork and basket shooting that
swept the Cedar Rapids aggregation
off their feet, and enabled the Scarlet
and Black ﬁve to amass a. comfortable
lead. Coe caged but two ringers dur-
ing the ﬁrst period, the score at half
time being; 17 to 6 in favor of the
Pioneers. Although Coo exhibited
much better teamplzty and basket
shooting in the second half, they were
unable to cut down the long lead
gained by Grlnuell.

mediately after the start of the game
But the Pioneers out in front. Team—
work dnring this period was the best
displayed by the Grinnell quintet this
year, and most of the baskets came as
a result of working the ball down the
floor on short passes. Coe was seldom
in possession of the ball, and had few
short shots at the hoop. Meyers and
Liddle each tossed a counter for Coe,
while Meyers broughi. the total up to
six by making good two out of three
foul attempts.

The Cedar Rapids team came back
strong after the inter-mission, and two
baskets by Mohrbaoher threatened to
make the game interesting. The rally
was short—lived, however, as baskets
by Evans and Shocsmith lengthened
the distance between the two teams.
Honors for the remainder of the game
were about even, although Daubenber-
ger, injected into the contest in the
middle of the half, tossed in two ring-
crs as against the one added by Mey—
ers.

Teamwork Good.

The teamwork of both teams was
good, and the basket shooting was
steady if not sensational. Coe resort
ed to a long passing game with little
success, as Winter and Wasseuar broke
up most of the passes.

Shades of Homer and Virgil:

The classical siren is giving way
and unless she can stage a rally in
the next few years will be entirely out
of the running and retired to an old

According to the ﬁgures Latin has
decreased 9.4%; Greek has slumped
10.4%.; and Philosophy 4.3%. On the
other hand, in the social sciences
Economics which was not ranked
among the minor subjects twenty years
ago, stands high in popularity now
with a percentage of 5.7. History still
holds a high place with 15.8%. And
English has increased by leaps and

it has increased to 13.7%.

Among the physical sciences there
has been a falling off of 3.5%, Botany

Two-Thirds of Registrants For
Second Semester Delinquent
This Morning.

Only about crie~third or those rcg-
jstcred for the second semester had
paid their fees this morning, with for
day the last dzty to pay without the
extra ﬁne of one dollar for late pay-
ment, according to reports from the
tl'eztsul‘cr’s office. There are quite ft
number Who have not registered With
the registrar. Those registering after
the speciﬁed lime Will also be Subject
to a fee of one dollar.

Full registraﬁon reports could not
be estimated this morning, because of
the slowness on the part of some of
the students to register. It is thought
that there may be a slight increase in
enrollment for the second semester,
because of the number of former stu-
dents retuming from other colleges
and new students Severn! former
students who have been teaching
school have decided to re-enter colr
loge. '

The large number of courses open
at the beginning all the second semes-
ter has induced a number of those
who would have graduated at the mid
year to remain.

F‘inztl ﬁgures on registration will be

BASKET THRILLEH
m £qu PERIOD

The Teams Are Evenly
Matched —— Final
Score Is 28-26.

Five minutes overtime enabled
Washington University, of St. Louis,
to win over the Pioneers in a contest
replete with till-ills on the local court
last night, by a. 28 to 26 count. >The
game was the most sensational seen
here in several years, and kept both
spectators and players on edge
throughout.

That the teams were uncommonly
evenly matched is shown by the fact
that at both half time and at the end
of the regular playing period the
score was a. tie. Two baskets in the
extra. sessmn by Washington and one
for the Pioneers ﬁnally decided the
conicst. With a minute of the regular
period left to play, Gl‘inuell seemed
2t victor by two points, but two baskr
ets in quick Succession put Washing-
ton ahead. ll/assenar’s sensational
basket shooting Il'o mthe side of the
court Lied the count and forced the
added period.

Fillers Set Lead.

Washington’ got away in the lead
on 'a basket by Marouardt, but Evans
evened it up .lly a. ringer following
a quick dribble. The lead seesawed
for the rest of the hall, with both
teams missing short range shots and
caging sensational baskets from time
to time. The Pioneers gathered
six ringers to ﬁve for the Pikers, brrt
lllztrqunl'dt’s eye for foul throws even-
ed thlngs up.

The second half was much the same
as the ﬁrst, only more so. At one
time the Pioneers were four points
to the good, but. fast. Work all the
part of Horn and Russell cut down this
advantage. With Crinnell three points
ahead and two minutes to play, Mar-
quardt tossed in st free throw and
Horn caged two ﬁeld baskets, put-
ting the Pikers two points in the lead,
With only seconds lett, Wassenar drib-
bled down the iloor and caged a ring—
er from long range.

Ploy Emir Period.

The extra period was halt gone
before Hurd tossed in two points, fol—
lowed soon after by Lippett’s ringer.
Evans got one through the hoop with
seconds left to play, but the time—
keeper’s gun cut short the’ crowd’s
pleading for the necessary ﬁeld goal.

The Washington team played in-
gether better than any live seen on
the local ﬂoor for some time, while
the teamwork and guarding of the
Pioneers showed championship quall<
ties, Both unintets were weak on
short range shots, but caged sensa—
tional baskets. Evans of Grinnell ran
wild throughout the game tossing in 1
held goals from all angles for a total
of 14 points. Wassenar's guarding
and offensive work was remarkable,
While Shoesmilh prover] a. big cog in
the teamwork of the Pioneer quintet.
"Al” Mal'qllardt, all-Missouri football
center, played a stellar game at for—
ward, and Hurd at the other for-ward
gathered half or his team’s twelve
ﬁeld goals. Russell’s dashes down the
ﬂoor from guard position were a con—
stant source of worry to his oppon»
ents.
