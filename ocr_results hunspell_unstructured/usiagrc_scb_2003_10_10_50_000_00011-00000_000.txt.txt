The craze for mgtime musieswept America beginning in the 18905,

yneopation ofAfriean Amerietn music, which was a combination of

rican drumming rhythms and Caribbean dance rhythms. It developed

:euneig. regtime “really made you want to dance snd get up inti siomp
iiound.”

in his lecture—recital, Feiii—ieig hopes to correct any preeoneeived
unions that his audience has about ragtime. “People have stereotyped
deas ofragtime in general," said reureeig. “The music that gets
tighlighred is very hnppy and light music, which is not the only type of

Feurzeig first became inspired by rogtimc after listening to his first
recording of stride pianist James P. Johnson's "Keep orrrhe Grist." To
his day, it remuins one ofhir favorite songs, snd he’ll be performing it

tiring his concert as well :is lohnson’s famous “The Carol A Shout."
The prognm \vlii inelude not only worlts by traditiond rsgrime
omposers such as Scott Joplin, Fats Waller and Eubie Blake but also
ome twentieth century compositions ofceotge Gershwin snd William
alltam. The muriewill range from folierime ragtime to elsssical ragtime
to stride and novelty styles. Fourieig will even perform his own ragtime
versions of several famous tunes such as “We Shall Overcome" and the
lassie “Happy Birthday."

Fenneig is excited to perform it Grinnell bemuse of ragtimes
Midwestern roots. “Ragtime Is really: Midwestern music," he said “so I
want to emphasize that but also focus on how it changed as it was
adopted by the cost Coast guys who considered themselves more

’ \

 

sophisticated than the folk time players of the Midwest."

Feutceig divides his time between teaching music or illinois state
University and touring the United states playing eclectie i:crut:»rccitals.
He is considered to be e virtuoso and his reehnreal skill as a pianist tan be
seen in his accomplishments on the both national and internatioml
levels. He was the silver medolist ofthe 2001 world Championship Old
Time piano Playing Contest and won the 2003 New Ragtime Competi-

broad audience. in portieuler, he hopes that those who dont normally go
to e Ior ofconcerts but ire interested in the color bottle surrounding
regiiine music will urtend, Music professor Jorge Torres hopes that
Grinnell students will “see the negsted innuenee ofAfrican American
music on n lot ofeoinposors."

“I wnnt to talk shout the dialogue bade and forth between black
music and pop music." seid Feuneig. how the Color line has played

lot of people did not realize ragtime wet bled: music; on the other hand.
there nus Iors ofresisiauioe from the musical establishment because
ragtime was black music."

in conjunction with the symposium, Feurceig will show the symbolic
burden that DuBois pleyed on African Amerioin music by focusing on
both the musical and the economic angles to the black-white intersetion
associated with ragtime, In the same manner rhnt DiiBois' eolleetion of
Negro Spirllunls entitled “Oftiic Soult' songs" use music to diseuss the
eulruml rimihtetionr ofAfrieziireAmcilcan experience in America,
Fcuncig': music will present the thellenges faced by hleelt nigtime
musieiuns. in particular, Feunelg will discuss the wsy in uhieh white
musieiens who imitated ragtime received more money then their black
oounrerpsrts and how this led to the crotrfertiloation of regtiine into s
muslcai style that could be played ind enioyetl by ell mccs, Though
Feui—ieig was not originslly scheduled to perform in conjunction with the
symposium, both English professor sieve Andrews who is oigenizing the
symposium, and Torres, who arr-.inged for Feuneig to demo to Grinnell,
believe that Feuneig's performunee will greatly enrich rhe symposium.

“Feuneig's specialties are rnicing the development ofAfriean
American music into non African American pop music and showing how
Afriein American rhythms are used in white popular music," said Torres.
“He [Fcurzcig] is an extremely gifted musician” he added “and we are very

David Moore

by Emilia Garvey

ste Moom does not play his music loud enough or
crazy enough to get just enyone’s attention. and that is
just the way it is supposed to be. Comfortable and
slightly restrained, he strums his guitar and sings slow
end smooth like he is pluying for a few old friends on a
summer evening instead of for a crowd ofexcited folk
fans, Folk loveis like these should be in abundance at
Faulconer Gallery today or 7 pm, to catch his show.

Moore is a folksinger, pure and simple. In addition
to the guitar, he use plays the key armrdion end
harmonies. l-lis moo ore in iowa city. and he has
played for Garrison Keillot's nidio show, A Prairie Home
Cmrtpanmn, a number of times, so he has earned his
regional folk credentials. “He is one of the musicians
that has helped define iowa Citys unique sound and its
reputation as a small place where some great originul
music is being created," said Karla Neihus. the curator
ofeducation it the Feulconer Gallery, who was
responsible for getting Moore to campus for this event.
He has been compared to Leon Redbcine and Jim
Croce. but the blend of his musial style, his writing and
his voice are his own. Midwestern origins and calm,
eollected melodies oiil soothingly to listeners and lull
them into a pleasant folk daydream.

Dave Moore easily ﬁts the mission ofrhe Rooo of
Renewal project. He re-examines die Midwest with his
quiet. oldefashioncd sounds, playing some older songs as
well es many ofhis own emotions. songs about blissful
love, the darkness of loss, and folk politics have all found
their way into his catalog. He also infuses what might
best in called a TeXeMex style into some of his material.
It is a twangy up-tcmpcr atoordion ﬂavor that oonyures
up slow polka: and writes. And on songs liire “I‘ll Be
Alright," he infuses a bit of Elvis-style rockabilly. Moore
never goes over the top. but he is innovative within the
style he chooses.

Dave Moore is a genuine singer.songwriter with
more than ten years ofeitperience with his craft. Ar
Neihaus said, “He's not rust recycling the same old trite
stuff. He has a straightforward quality and is really
present for his audience." Moore plays decent, unmume
ing tunes for anyone willing to lend an ear. Friday night
at Faulconer Gallery. Grinnellioiis looldng to unwind
will have the chance to experience Dave Moore’s front-
porch summer evening approach to folk music.
