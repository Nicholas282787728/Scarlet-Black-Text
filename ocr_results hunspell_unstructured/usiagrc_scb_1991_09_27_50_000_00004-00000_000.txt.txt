Best Buddies program beneﬁts
college students, Varea youths

By Julie Pecaut

As a group, people with mental
retardation (MR) have often been for-
gotten in modern society. For this
reason, many people cling to stereo
types and misconceptions about
people with Nmmever really discov»
ering what these people have to offer.

Best Buddies, a program now in
its second year at Grinnell, matches
localmentallyretardedteenagerswith
college studens in an effort to edu-
cate college students about will and
providea basis for friendship between
the two groups.

“The focus is not on helping the
person wim MIR, but in getting to
know them as a talented, interesting,
valuable person," explained Heather
Torrence-Stanton. founder and co-
director of the Grinnell chapter.

Group activities planned for Best
Buddies this semester include bowl-
ing, a pizza pany and skiing; how-
ever, most of the interaction between
college students and their buddies
occurs on a one-on-one basisr

According to Torrence-Stanton,
both the teenagers and their college
buddies beneﬁt from the experience.

“The teenager develops more self-
esteem and conﬁdence, as well as

valuable social skills. The college
student learns about mental retarda-
tion, meets members of thetown com
munity, and has an opportunity to do
something that is both worthwhile
and nonracademic,” she said.

The Grinnell chapter ofBestBudr
dies is unique in that leadership of the
group includes a “buddy director"—
a teenager with MR who acts as a
liaison between the buddies and the
college students.

Amanda Benson, who fulfills this
role,said,“My job istoseeif they [the
teenagers] are getting along with and
doing stuff with their buddies. I also
help makeout the schedule and match
buddies.”

Buddies are matched according to
the results of an intervrew and a per-
sonality profile. An organizational
meeting took place September 17,
and there was signiﬁcant response
from college students - so significant
that not all interested students may
get a buddy,

Best Buddies offers an opportu—
nity for college students to learn more
aboutmental retardation, interact with
the town community, and make new
friends. In addition, it provides a
chance for mentally retarded teenag-
ers to be valued for themselves.

Grinnell graduate works for social
change through community service

 

By Karen Nutter

“I look at community service as an
integral partofmy life." Notmany of
us can say this in good conscience;
we might do volunteer work hereand
there,betweenclasses and “real“ jobs,
butthereareso many otherthings that
need to be done. Who has time to
make community service integral?

Kent Koth does. A committed
volunteer worker and 1990 graduate
of Grinnell, Koth was invited by the
Community Service Center to come
back to campus last week and talk to
students about the role community
service plays in his life. Before a
South Lounge crowd of approxi-
mately 35 students, Koth spoke
quickly and easily about his past and
presentserviceprojects, sharing along
the way his philosophies and attir
tudes towards volunteerwork and the
ways it can develop “a new commu-
nity, a new nation. a new world,"

A history major, Koth gothis start
volunteering at Grinnell when he
joined Students Helping the Home
less in 1988. The following year, he
organizedIheAltemativeHappyHour
program, which sends Grinnell stu-
dents to visit with Des Moincs school

“I look at community
service as an integral
part of my life.”
- Kent Koth

children on Friday nights, Out of the
Alternative Happy Hour program
developed theAltemzttiveBreak pro
gram , which offers Grinnell students
the opportunity to spend their fall,
winter or spring breaks working on a
volunteer project.

For his commitment to the above
projects,l(othwas awardedaSamuel
Huntington Public Service grant in
1990. This grant awarded him
$10,000, which hecould apply to any
service project of his design.

What he designed, with fellow
Grinnell graduate Scott Hamilton, is
now known as the Alternative Break
Coalition (ABC). Centered in down-
town Portland, Oregon, ABC offers
college students in that region the
chance to aid themselves and their
community by spending their winter
orspring breaks doing volunteer work
in the downtown area.

and spendtheirdays and nights work
ing in neighborhood social service
agencies and centers, doing every
thing from working on the selfvcsr
teem of the neighborhood kids, to
cooking lunch and socializing in a
center for HIV positive patients, to
hanging out and drinking coffee at
night with the homeless people of the
area.

In the beginning, Koth admitted
With a laugh, “It was difficult to get
credibility". No one seemed to trust
two guys from Iowa who wanted to

are helping.

Near the end of his presentation,
Koth read statements from former
participants as he showed slides of
volunteers in the community. All

. regarded the Alternative breaks as

with the aid of the First ANEE Zion
Church (in which the Students now
stay) and the help of professors and
chaplains in thearea‘scolleges,l<oth
and Hamilton had ten students from
Lewis and Clark College serving a
Thanksgiving dinner to ten of the
area’s homeless people.

ABC grew in popularity after this,
and since that time roughly 100 stuA
dents from colleges and universities
such as Oregon State, Reed and
Willamette, as well as a few students
from Grinnell have served a com»
binedtotalof5500hoursofvolunteer
work,with21differentorganizatiotts.

Not only have the students helped
the community, Koth insisted, but
they also have grown themselves,
learning from the speakers which
teach each night of the week»long
break, as well as from thepeople they

“eye-opening" experiences, and op-
portunities to “shatter stereotypes”
on both sides of the tracks.

ABC is now affiliated wim the
Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon
This was a financial move, explained
Koth,becausetheinstitutionalization
of ABC makes it possible to obtain
grants and keep the organization op-
crating. Koth,however,will no longer
be co-managing the program;
Hamilton will continue full time.

Kolh is by no means leaving com
munity service, however; he is the
new Community Outreach Program
Director at Willamette University,
where he will continue to direct his
energies towards social change. His
goal is to make programs such as
ABC unnecessary; the experiences
are wonderful for the volunteers, but
the reality is that those wonderful
experiences are based on someone
else's hunger or homelessness, and
these are things which mustbe elimi-
nated.

Until the time when all have the
basic necessities of life, and volun»
teers are no longer needed, Koth will
bescrvinghiseommunity,urgingoth-
ers to "step outof their comfortzones"
and break down “the barriers which
separateus from eachothcr.”Heurged
all students at Grinnell to volunteer,
to lean-t from those around them and
give something back to the commue
ntty.
