GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The economics department has a
unique distinction in this, the
most nianless year in college
history . 1'. had as majors
100% of 135'. SCmESter'S senior
. men ﬂ both of Lhem.

Although suffering from a de-
cline in enrollment since the
war, economics, once considered
a man’s field, is drawing many
women studen at the present
time. The ad tan of contem-
porary economic problems and
consumers economics to the cur-
riculum is partly responsible for
,l'aising feminine interest in the
field, since these courses are giv-
I en in connection With the new
euthenics program.

Grinnell was one of the col-
leges that pioneered in offering
economics to its students.
considered a separate depart-
ment in the early days, it was
,offered in combination with sev-
‘eral other departments. These
‘combinations seem rather ludic-
grous today, in view of the dif—

ferences in subject matter.
When first given at crinnell,
in the 1880’s, economics was
thought to be a philosophy, and
Adam Smith was studied along
with Kant and Hegel. At that
time, Professor Jem Macy
taught the subject, while occu-
pying the chair of social stu-
dies, The width of his subject
matter once led the professor
to remark, “I don't occupy a
chair . . . x occupy a settee.“
Later, economics was grouped
with sociology in a department
headed by Professor G. F. Wyck—
off. By the beginning of World
War I, a separate department of
,buslness administration was es
tablished to deal with such tech-
iiical subjects as marketing.
salesmanship, and accounting, but
economics continued in combi-
nation wiui sociology. When Dr.
Earl D. strong joined the fac-
ulty in 1921, the two depart-
ments were separated, and eco-
nomics was combined with busi-
rness administration.

Valentine . . .

Once upon a daytime dreary,

Bent with' shopping tasks and weary—~
Wandered I to Younker Brothers

Seeking gifts for you—and others.

There I spied a sight devine—

Lots and lots of Valentines!

Packages both long and high—

(Not a one could I pass by!)

They have some for dads and mothers,

Uncles, sisters, aunts and brothers!

On each and every floor I’d

That special gift I had in mi

find
nd.

Candies, flowers, books so new—

Gifts that burst with “I Love You."

Gifts galore in colors bright—

Gifts I know will be just right!

So with myYounker gift I’II quote that line—
“Oh won’t you be MY VALENTINE!”

In the twenties and thirties,
this was the largest department
in the college, according to Dean
Strong, However, with the re»
tirement of Professor Grass of
the business administration derl
pertinent, and the rcorganizatio
of the college into an exclusive
ly liberal arts institution, the de
partment of business administra-
tion was dropped from the our»
riculum. 0f the courses offered
by the department, the only
_technical subject that has been
continued is accounting.

The department looks for a
large increase in enrollment im-
mediately following the war.
Social studies became extreme-
ly popular following the first
world war, and this phenome-
non will probably re-occur. Dean
Strong feels that it may be ex-‘
plained by the fact that during
war time, “the importance or
economic relationships has be~
come‘ manifest to many peo-,
ple."
