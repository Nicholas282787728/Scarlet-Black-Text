ute rushes of Griunrll college and

piled up in early events. The meat
was held at Creighton university.

with a total of 54 points. three less
than the Drake representatives. and
only one more than their Oklahoma
rivals, who showed unexpected
strength to make the meet a three
cornered race all the way Aggie
strength in late events was a big
factor in the Grinnell defeat.

Chance to Win

The Pioneers had several chances
to win the meet. but were unable to
bring in expected points, Murphy ran
the fastest quarter mile of his cola
legiate career. only to be beaten at
the tape by Gallagher. the sensational
Drake sophomore.

Kukolich tossed the discus over 130
feet in the preliminaries Friday only
to step out of the ring and be dis-
qualiﬁed. Van Laningham-s victory in
the mile run was also a blow to the
Grinnell team. It was his first per
formance in that event this year. but
he turned a 4:34 race to take first
place.

Pilhrow Ieads Final Mile

Myron Pilhrow. Grinnell‘s outstandr
ing sophomore tweamiler. ran the
greatest race of the day to defeat
Jenkins of the Aggie crew. He took
the lead at the beginning of the seen
and mile. and ﬁnished with yards to
spare. It is the Pioneer’s second tri-
umph over Jenkins. each man having
beaten the other once in’ previous
competition.

The Pioneers took ﬁrsts in both the
half-mile and mile relay races. Alex—
ander won thirds in the 100. 220. and

Palmer Finds

Life Heritage

Chicago Theologian Talks
on Modern Religion

at Vespers

That life ‘and religion may be an
heritage and an adventure was the
theme of a talk by the Rev. A. W.
Palmer. president of Chicago Theo-
logical seminary. in vespers Sunday.
Religion. he brought out. like the
Sistine Madonna. is something final
and complete. an abiding possession
of the race,

Yet. Mr. Palmer averl‘ed. some
things of every heritage must he dis-
carded. War is an example that is
“no longer a glorified game but a
supreme tragedy. A. king returns
after a war to find his throne an un-
comfortable place on which to sit. his
country burdened with debts for gen-
erations unborn."

Alcohol too, and the idea of de-
moniac possession are things which

ligion. ”Why do we not discard de-
nominational possession in the same
way, and the doctrine of eternal pun-
ishment?"
