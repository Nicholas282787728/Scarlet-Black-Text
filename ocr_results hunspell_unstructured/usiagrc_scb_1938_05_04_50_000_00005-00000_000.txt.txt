Thinclacls Try
For Honors at

Beloil Friday

Colleges from Six
States to Compete
In Night Meet

By Clark Smith

Early Thursday attcrnooii 18
trackmen will leave for Beloit,
Wis.. to participate in the Beloit
college relays to he held Friday
night under the lights. The cream
of athletes from colleges in six
states will vie for honors in this
track carnival held under the
stars.

Coach (3. Lester
that Grinnell has an excellent
chance to cop the team trophy,
but to do this, the thin clads must
score in the neighborhood of 50
points,

Duke feels

The strength of the other teams
is unknown, so Duke has entered
teams in every rclay event, fig-
uring on all around team strength
to pile up the sutficient number
of points rather than concentrat—
ing his strength in one or two
events.

Lawrence college from Wiscon-
sin, Yankton of South Dakota,
and Coe are expected to he Grin-
nell-s toughest opposition, but
this is not too certain as enough
is not known about the other en-
tries.

The medley relay team, the
quarter mile team and the trio of
shuttle hurdlcrs are expected to
turn in the best performances for
the Pioneers. In the field events,
Powers in the broad jump and
Robinson in the pole vault stand
good chances of placing high in
their field of competition.

Two cripples on the squad are
expected to be in good shape by
Friday night. John Hayward
should be in the best shape of the
outdoor season as his back is
healing rapidly. If the co-captain
is in top shape he should pick up
points in the discus and javelin
and anchor the shuttle hurdle
team. Frank Pfohl is still lim .
ing from his ankle injury but it is
hoped that he will be in good
enough condition to place in the
high jump. A complete list of
entries for the meet follow:

Pioneer Nelmen
Play Cyclones
Here Friday

The Pioneer netmen have only
one meet scheduled for this week-
end. that meet being with Iowa
State college. The meet will be
Friday afternoon on the local
courts.

The team had fair success last
Week when they heat Carleton
college, 4-3 Friday and then lost
770 to the University of Minne-
sota Saturday.

The members of the team had
a bit of a shakeup in the stand-
ings Tuesday when Jack Savage
forfeited to Robert Berry. Berry
thereby taking over the third po-
sition, Savage slipping to fourth,
and John Turner descending to
fifth.

Vernon Cornish plays the first
position and capt. Dwight Porter
is the second man, these positions
being the ranking for the Iowa
State match.

Faint Hope for
lnl'rasquad Til’r
By Grid Teams

The traditional intrasquad fool:
ball game that closes the spring
practice session has faded into
a very faint possibility. Due to
the small Squad, the last day of
practice will probably be spent
in scrimmage.

Coach Guy Lookahaugh reports
great disappointment in not be—
ing ahle to have the game Fri-
day because he had planned on
picking out something of a start-
ing lineup from the squad, The
team this year is about two-
thirds as big as the one rcpoi -
ing last spring. The men repoi
ing have been working on funda-
mentals and the speeding up of
plays for the past five Weeks.

The ofticial date for fall pracs
tiee to begin will probably be
September 10, two weeks before
the game scheduled with Cornell
College. Coach Lookahaugh said
he does not expect the propor—
tionate decrease in the Squad to
extend to the fall group.

Sludenl' Vole
Favors Peace

“No War' Is Result
of Relations Poll
Held Last Week

Grinnell students favor peace
with every abitrary and compro-
mising means possible, the re-
sults of the plebiscite sponsored
by the International Relations
committee showed today.

’Only eleven students of the
total number voting favored war
as a means of settling world
problems.

The results showed that the'
overwhelming majority of the
students would go to war only if
the United States were invaded.
When asked “What should the;
United States do in case of armed
conflict?" the students voted al-
most unanimously against ship-
ping munitions to any of the has
tions at war.

Collective security (international
cooperation in solving disputes
and quarrels between nations) re-
ceived the greatest number of
votes as a means of settling
world problems. World socialism
drew 27 votes as the only means
of solving these problems, the re-
sults showed.

Reduction of military and naval
budgets was favored only if all
other major world powers did
likewise.

A plebiscite similar to the one
held here was given to the Iowa
State college students and showed
comparitively the same results on
all points.

Previous Defeat
At Galesburg

with the exception of the fourth
