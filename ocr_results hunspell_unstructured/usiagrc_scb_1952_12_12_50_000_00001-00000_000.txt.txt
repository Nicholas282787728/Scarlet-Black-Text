Following the” Latin grace,
spontaneous toasting, and the
dinner, the glee club will close

the ceremony with“God ltestYe,
Merry Gentlemen.”

The Boers Head ceremony is
an export to Grim-tell from
Queen’s college at Oxford, Eng-
lland. Two legends attempt to
explain the custom, which has
been an annual event in England

since the 12th century.

One attributes the ceremony to

‘an ancient rite of the Norsemen,

who would sacrifice a bear to
their god of peace and plenty,_
Freyer, who used a boar to ride
on during his religious missions

The other Says that an English
student killed a boar that at-
tacked him by craming an Aris-
tDtle text down the boat's throat.
The Celebration that followed be—

 

came an annual event.
