Departments Discuss

Towards the end of last semester, the faculty ended weeks of
debate by abolishing all but one course requirement for graduae
tion. The other large item of news lastsemester was the cut of
$366,000 from the budget for the next fiscalyear. Both of these
developments have grave import for theacademicaffairs of the
college. To try to get an idea ofjust what that import might be,
the S&B interviewed faculty members in each of the depart

ments.

In anticipation of the adoption of President Leggett’s proposed
reorganization plan, we took the liberty of organizing the arti-
cles around the proposed divisions (they seem to work fairly

well).

Some general observations on our findings: 1) therewasn't as
much change as everyone feared. In fact, languages were the
only losers (plus theater).The excellent showing ofthe sciences
should earn them Comeback of the YearAward, since everyone

had pronounced them dmd.

Class sizes are disappointingly high in psychology (average
29), education (26), religious studies (26), Amerimnstudies (25),
anthropology (25), history (24), philosophy (24) and political
science (24). We understand that the seemingly high class
sizes in biology (28) and chemistry (27) are both due entirely
to pedagogical situations and that there are no overcrowding

problems in either department.

Small class sizes (important because of the budget consider-
ations) were noted in Russian (6 1/2), German(9), theater (.10),
communications (10 1/2), French (11), Spanish (11), classics
(12), comparative literature (13) and sociology (13 1/2). Of
these, German, theater, French and possibly sociology will
pay the price by losinga teacher (Frenchwill lose an additional
parrtime instructor). Comp‘. 1it., which is small only because
it consists of upper-level literature courses, nevertheless
will lose a teacher. Russian, communications, Spanish and
classics all have the dubious distinction of being too small to
sustain any cuts while maintaining a viable program.

Other departments slated to lose faculty include physics,
biology (possibly two), chemistry and possibly (though incred-
ibly) political science. Apparently the only department seeking
to add members is American studies, although thereis a clear
need for another psychology professor and a philosophy/reli-
gious studies man, If the college were even slightly richer,
it could consider adding to art, education, history, political
science and anthropology, while eliminating the cuts in comp.
lit. and theater. Another pressing item, but which is now out
of the question (most unfortunately), is an addition to the fine
arts center. In general, it must be noted that staff plans seem
to realistically reflect (within necessary limitations) the stud-

ent demand.

Note: Preliminary figures from the registrar‘s office show
that about 300 students are taking independents this semester,
a rise of 30 over last year at this time and of 50 over two

years ago.

ScienceNumbersSurprise/vloslL

The prophets of doom, who
predicted a great shift away
from the sciences anda lack
of commitment to broad edu'
cation on the part of students
following the abolishment of
course requirements last
semester, must have breathed
a sigh of relief upon seeing
the enrollment figures in the
sciences.

Physics, largely on the str-
ength of its courses for none
science majors, was the sec-
ond-fastest growing depart
ment last semester; and bio-
logy, with a large Bio 11 one
rollment, was net far behind.
PHYSICS

The tremendous physics ene
rollment was a surprise to
everyone but Professor Beryl
Cletfelter, chairman of the
faculty and author of the ori~
ginal noerequirements proper
sal. ”I was never much wor-
ried about the sciences," he
said, with the quiet undertone
of 'I told you so.’ "The new
requirements seem to be
working quite well. The fact
that students aren't required
to take a course seems towhet
their appetite.'(

Clotfelter teaches one of the
two physics courseswhichare
primarily aimed at the nonr
science major. His course on
the universeattracted34 stud*
ents, while Professor Grant
Gale‘s course has an enrolls
ment of 20. Cale will teach an
Historical Approach to Phy-
sics again first semester next
year. The large enrollment in
these courses also reflected
the lack of student interest in
the old Science II course.

In the rest of the physics de-
partment, which consists of
six teachers and about 25
majors, life is more normal.
Professor Wayne Denny will
be on leave next year, and it
is not known if his position
will be filled.

CHEMISTRY

Chemistry has no courses for
the non-science major this
semester, but Professor J05,
eph Danforth is considering
such a course, entitled "Corr
temporary Problems in Che-
mistry" for next year. The
course would involve liter-

‘ ature study, class discussion

and laboratory work on a pro
blems-oriented basis. These
problems would include eco-
logy, drugs and the compogir
tion of moon rocks. One ofthe
aims of the course is to in-
crease student participation
beyond what is normal in the
sciences. A possibility for the
year after next isa bio- chemr
istry course for non-science
majors.

This semester the chemisr
try department has an unus-
ually light load because they
have an extra professor (fine
anced by the Sloan Founda-
tion) and because of the elime
ination of Science 11. Assists
ant Professor Philip Bays will
teach at Argonne next year to
allow chemistry to drop back
to its normal five-man con—
tingent. There are about 35
chemistry majors.

BIOLOGY

"I was floored" was Pro-
fessor Karl DeLong's res-
ponse to the Bio 11 enrollment
this semester, which was well
over 100. However, this ens

Effects Of Requirements Changes
BehaviorDivisionHoIdsSieady

The departments comprising

the proposed Division of Be-
haviorial Sciences have gen»
erally experienced a drop in
enrollment in introductory
courses but a fairly constant
level of overall enrollment.
The departments in the pro
posed division include Psyr
chology, Sociology, Political
Science, Economics, and Ans
thropology.

The Psychology department
has four profs teaching 10
classes with an average of
about 29 students per class.
Although a large number of
these students are concentra-
ted in the general psychology
course, an introductory cou-
rse, the department also car-
ries 45 majors.

Next year the department is
losing assistant professor
Keith Gerritz and will gain a

replacement, yet unnamed,
leaving the personel level
constant. Due to the freshman
tutorial that will be offered,
however, one section must be
cut somewhere.

Assistant professor john
Morris, speaking of trends in
the department, said, "I look
for growth of independentma-
jors centering around a psy-
chology core, for those who
are interested in psycholo-
gical idms in social process
ses." Morris also feels that
if the department could Offer
a few more human psychology
courses, it could better meet
the needs of nonrmajors.

Morris noted that there has
been little participation of
majors in course planning in
the past, and said that this
situation is to be rectified
next week in a meeting with

Requirements Huri languages

If any division was injured by
the ending of requirements, it
had to be Languages and Lil?
erature. In a number of cases
enrollments dropped, forcing
cutbacks in faculty.

Classics, however,isholding
steady. The department has
two fulltime and twopartetime
instructors offering six cour-
ses. The average class size is
twelve, and there are six ma-
jors. Student involvement in
curriculum planning is great.
William McKibben stated that
there are no meetings of face
ulty members only; students -
even non-majors - arealways
present.

Since requirements were dr~
opped, there is a real gap
created by the reduction in
humanities classes. As a re
sult the departmentisworking

rollment was compensated for
by the low enrollment in Sci*
ence, or Bio, Is-about 50 stud‘
ents.

The biology , department,
much like the chemistry dee
partment, has an unusually
light load this semester, be
cause no one is on sabbatti-
ml this year (there were two
last year) and because of the
low Bio lenrollment. Instrucr
tor Robert Resech and Assis-
tant Professor John Armst-
rong will net be returningnext
year, but the departmenthopes
to replace Armstrongwithan-
Other genetics specialist.

DeLong expects the Bio l
enrollment to come back up
next semester, as he notes
that 200 students took the
course first semester. Bio-
logy, the largest by far of the
science departments, has
more than 100 majors.
MATHEMATI$

“There are as many prob
lems in a course for non-
majors as there are good th-
ings coming out of them,"
asserted Associate Professor
Arnold Adelberg, whileadmit~
ting that there was some ten‘
tative thinking going on about
such a course.

Adelberg is a bit leary ofhis
department‘s upcoming parlir
cipation in the tutorial prog-
ram. "We've never done any
non-math courses before,”he
explains.

The department has re
mained basically the same
this semester. Thereare4 1/3
professors and twelve majors.
Adelberg expects some revi-

sions next year in the upper-
level courses.

harder to interest freshmen.
McKibben is planning a fresh
man tutorial called Greek my-
thology and religion for next
semester. McKibbenalsosays
that in general "We've only
scratched the surface of in
dependent , work possibili-
ties.” The department hopes
to encourage more independ-
ent work by majors to free
professors for work withnon-
majors. Flexibility of offers
ings is to some extent limited
by small faculty, small claS‘
ses, and a lack of time.
McKibben feels that classics
form a valuable core for the
liberal arts and a study of
man and his world. This sems
ester's Art and Archaeology
class includes 42 people; sev-
eral were closed out. There
are also more people in be-
ginning Greek than ever be-
fore (15). Suggestinga longer-
range ”relevance" fora clas-
sics major McKibben men-
tioned that some people have
gone to law, medical or busi-
ness schools with classics
majors.

Comparative literature re-
flected a gloomier picture.
Enrollment ins remained con-

(continued to page 7)

a handful of senior majors to
discuss curricular changes.

Looking ahead, Morris said,
“I have my doubts that we can
meet the demand with four
professors in the near future.
We're presently forced to use
the new socialpsychology man
to teach statistics." Morris
said that it would be more ap,
propriate for thisman to teach
the psychoeling-uistics, cog-his
tive development, and attitude
change courses which the de-
partment hopes to offer.

The Sociology department,
with four professors, ten coue
rses, and about 14 students
per course, has one ofthe loxve
est average class enroll-
ments. Professor Irwin Golds
berg estimated about 25 maj-
ors in the department, but
said that “They comeand they
go with the seasons."

The formal introductory cour
rse suffered a drop in enroll-
ment this semester, but this
may be partially due to the
large enrollment in the other
100 level course, a Prisons
Seminar, offered for the first
time this semester. Although
about 80 students preregis-
tered for the course, only ab-
out 25 were actuallyadmitted.

Asked whether the depart
ment has plans to institute
more courses of this nature
because of theirapparentpop-
ularity, Goldberg, said, “We
had plans prior to the present
budgetary situation," but in~
dicated that at the present
time plans are uncertain.

Next year's staffing is also
uncertain, mainly becauseas~
sistant professor Benny Nefe
zger‘s half-time position at
the computer center is still
in doubt. Goldberg said, "Qir
intention would be to teach
as many courses as possible
in the area of deviant behav-
ioreedelinquency and crime,
mental health, and the family
Vas our resourcesallow,wh-
ile also teaching the core
courses ofsociology."Healso
commented that “Normally,
we would have the courses
completely fixed by now."

Semester Brings larger Classes

Those departments which
would form the proposed new
Division of Social Studies re
ported no significant shifts in
this semester's registration
except for general increases
in class sizes. American Stu-
dies, a department for the first
time this year, hadanaverage
of 25 studentsper class. Char-
les Cleaver, speaking for the
department, commented “Of
course classes are too big, but
we're still managing."

American Civilization, al-
ways apopularcourse, has 155
Students this semester. The
slight decrease from last se—
mester reflects the dropping
of one Am Civ section follow-
ing the depaarture of Robert
Corrigan, visiting prof for
first semester. The depart-
ment is currently looking for
an American Studies profes-
sor to replace BernardMere
gen, Who left Grinnell at the
end of last year. "We’re also
looking for someone in Afro-
American," said Cleaver. A
black woman interviewed for
the job turned down Grinnell
to take “an offer like I’ve no-
ver seen in the academic
world" at Northwestern.

The abolition of require-
ments is not affecting Amer-

ican studies curriculum plans.

Cleaver explained, "We’ve
been thinking of changes, but
they're not specifically a re"
sult of the narrequirement
thing." The department has
16 senior majors and 28 un-
derclassmen.

Communications has had its
present departmental organ-
ization for only the past year
and a half. William Vander‘
pool said that because of this
re- organization, it is difficult
to tell whether department tr-
ends are a result of the drop-
ped requirements or of the
reorganization.

"Orr intro course is justbe»
ing offered for the first time
this year. It looks good. We
have more enrolled than the
other arts intro courses. I
think the no requirement ru1~
ing will mean thatmorepeople
will elect communications
courses."

Asked to justify Communitzr
tions' status as a department
separate from English, Van-
derpool replied, "English is
literature-oriented while we
are behaviorroriented."

Curriculum changes may in-
clude a new course in inler*
