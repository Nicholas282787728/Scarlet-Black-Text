Grinnell Wednesday, September is, rgnr

HE support which strident
enterprises receive from
the progressive business men oi
Grinnell is very generous. Never
yet has an appeal been made to
these men and been rejected. The
_ return which the students can
make for these kindnesses are not
insigniﬁcant. if they will use the
opportunities at hand. That some
return should be made can not be
doubted. It IS very easily ascer-
tained that the men to whom the
students are indebted for many
favors, are the very men who as
sist so materially in the pllhliear
tion of this paper by their adver-
tisiilg. These men are the best
and most enterprising men in the
community and we take pleasure
in recommending them.

Improvements inthe College
Buildings.

Several convenient and pleasing
improvements in the buildings
have been made during the past
summer. One of the most noti~
ceable the new paint which
adorns the whole interior of Blair
Hall, This lightens up the build
ing and is certainly a change from
the previous clingy looking build
ing. In the chemistry laboratory
new tile tops lravcbeen laid on the
experiment tables.

The rooms on the third floor of
Chicago Hall have been
used for some years by the School
of Music have been completely
renovated. The ceilings have
been painted and the wood work
oiled and varnished In the base-
ment of the men‘s gymnasium the
old asbestos ﬂoor has been r-e
placed by one of cement. In

College Meeting at the Congree
gational Church.

A service especially arranged
for the students was held in the
Congregational church lastsurr
day evening. in the absence oi
Professor Boodin who was to have
charge oi the meeting, Professor
Main dellvered one of those lnter»
esting scholarly addresses so
characteristic of him. An intere
pretation of the motives ot Judas
in his betrayal of Cllrlsl. eonslre
tuted the subject matter of the
discourse.

One at the very pleasing
features of lhe scrvtce was the
special music under the direction
of Professor Mutlack,
