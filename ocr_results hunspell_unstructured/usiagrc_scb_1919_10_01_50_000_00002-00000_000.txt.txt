BEAT AMES!

The game with (lamp Dodge tor Sat-
urrlay has been cancelled. What does
that mean? It simply means that the

team will have to meet Ames minus a.

practice game. minus the experience

of playing a game together. It means
that the student body will have to keep
up its no); for mother Week without
the outside stimulus of a game. it also
means that we Will have a chance to
pop on the old school and get some

REAL SPIRIT throbbing thru the

halls of this institution.

Do you remember what the slogan
"Beat lows" did two years ago? It
accomplished something that hadn't
been done for twenty years. It heat
iowa in tootball 10 to o. This same
thing can be administered to Amos but
the team alone can't do it This is
the ﬁrst time for several years thnt
Grinneli has met Amos on the gridiron
Ind it is up to every one of us to see
that we "beat Amos."

Don’t worry about the team. Let
Ire conch do that. But you can and
ought to worry about lhe pep end of
the game. it's up to you, each and
every one of you, to supply the pens

Let’s see a little action. What are

- we going to do? Beat Amos! Beat
Ames! Beat Ames!

in ‘the rush and turmoil of our daily

brought bank to our senses by some
awful tragedy or sorrow. The other

come so overloaded with other duties
that they have to give up society but
for the freshmen and sophomores there
is no Outside interest that will coh-
tribute more to the dcevlupment of the

in the ﬁrst place it provides a place
to get acquainted and this is of Vital
consequence to the freshmen. it of-
ters good wholesome fellowship once
every Week where. men gel. together
for the discussion of worldwide topics.

For men who are interested in pub—
lic speahing and debating no more
valuable training is otfered in school.
If you are looking toward a piece on
me varsity debating team with an
Honor G in debate, no other means of
winning one is provided, tor oil var-
sity debaters are picked from the soci-
ety reams.

And last but not least’is the social
side 02 the societies. Each brother
and sister society put on a banquet
each year in addition to the many
joint meetings. picnics and other on-
tertainments.

77w Passing of Cinderella

THE quaint little childhood tale of
the poor kllchen maid is not so
far removed from recent reality.

For we all recall the staggering piles of
dishes, the dust-strewn ﬂoor, the tubs
of clothes, the treadmill task at the
sewing machines! Yes, Cinderella»
like was the housework of yesterday.

And now, the girl of 1920 looks in
electricity—most tractable of hand-
maidens—as the fairy prince who
makes life easier and fuller,

Just a push of the button—arid tiny
electric motors sweep, wash dishes
or clothes; clean, scour and polish;
make ice or ice cream, run the
sewing machine and may the piano
or phonograph.

General

While the motors do the work, other
electric appliances are distributed
about the house to make good living
more convenient. Electric cooking
utensils, hair driers, cigar lighters,
burglar alarms, door bells, and
furnace regulators, are now operated
by the magic wand of electric
Power.

The development of the miniature
motors for the kitchen and electrical
devices was made possible by the
rapid progress in experience gained
by the General Electric Company’s
Engineers, whose efforts in the appli.
cation of electricity for every sort of
industrial endeavor during the past
quarter century have brought {ree-
dorn from the drudgery of other days.
