BEST BET l . . If you prefer Southern
family life to gangland violence, then eat
on a Hot Tin Roof (less) is the movie to
see, This film version of Tennessee
William’s classic, albeit slightly tamed,
captures the desperation of the characters
and their plights. Although produced as a
vehicle for Elizabeth Taylor, it is Burl Ives
who charges the screen as he recreates his

Broadway role. A ruthless tyrant, Ives‘..

“Big Daddy” lives with a woman he
despises for the sake of producing two
heirs. The rivalry between sons Brick and
Cooper, Paul Newman and Jack Carson
respectively, amplifies the abnormality of
the family and the destruction it begets.
Brick finds his escape in the form ol
alcohol, endlessly searching for “the click
in my head” which makes all the pain go
away. Taylor’s thoroughly feline Maggie
comes across with surprising soreness.
Altemately panting and purring, she lights
to protect Brick and assure the lifestyle
she desires. Overall the film is a line
drama and one of the better screen adapta-
tions of William’s work.

ANOTHER OPTION . . r is the highly con-
troversial film The Warriors (1979). Some
claim this ﬁlm is nothing more than a
violent gloriiication of bruml gang war-
fare. Others feel the structure and
message of the film is classical and the
violence an essential vehicle, Visually the
film is captivating, as the camera takes
you through an urban nightmare, a neon
New York of nocturnal horrors. Though
the plot is non-existent the action is non»
stop, moving from dusk to dawn, from the
underground to the sea. The film is worth a
look if for no other reason than to decide
whether the graphic warfare oi the “ar-
mies of the night” is gratuitous or
necessary within the context of the film.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE , . J is the Woody
Allen classic What's Up Tiger Lily (1968).
Allen takes the footage of a B-grade
Japanese spy film and adds his own in
imitable English dialogue. This ins
congraous juxtaposition is pretty bizarre
and very entertaining If you’re in the
mood for a romp, this is the film to see.

m 10le r . . Back again for a second
time is the original Star Wars. Okay all
you Darth Vader tans, now is your chance
to again see yours truly in action. Time has
not changed life in that galaxy “long, long
ago and far, far away". Luke Skywalker,
Hans Solo and Princess Leiah run around
lighting for truth, justice and the
Skywalker way. Good still triumphs over
evil and the nice guy always gets the girl.
It you didn’t see this movie the first time
around, now is your chance to become in-
trigued by “the force."

OUT OF TOWN . . . if the urge to get
away irom Grinnell is already great,
Iowa City offers some relief, In addition
to the bars and clubs, this weekend,
Chicago based Second (ﬁty, an im-
provisational troupe, will perform at a
pm. at the Stephens Center.

Chariots of Fire, Shampoo and Cabaret
are just some of the big films lined up for
the fall. Others slated for this semester
range from the American classics lt Hap-
pened One Night and the original Invasion
0! the Body Snatchers, to Bread and
Chocolate and My Brilliant Career. Also in
the works are a Katharine Hepburn
festival for second semester, an
Australian weekend and a selection of
films by Polish director Wajda,

Working with a $19,000 budget, Film
Chairperson Ruth Kat: wants to combine
big name films and older, less expensive
movies to suit the student body's tastes.
Through signrup lists and mail surveys,
Katz hopes to get a sense of both the
speciiic movies and the general types of
movies the campus finds appeal-

ing.

Katz also works closely with Performing
Programs and Activities Counselor
Georgia Dental, who helps prevent the
selection of films shown within the last few
years. The few movies this semester
shown previously appear either by par»
ticular request by students or in keeping
with the theme of a given weekend.

Although $19,000 might not sound like a
large film budget, it affords quite a bit of
selection. In fact, the total cost of last
year’s films was less than the budget
allowed despite the numerous current
films shown first semester.

This semater movies will probably play
a more important role in weekend enter-
tainment. Due to the loss of North Lounge
as a gathering site, activities normally
held there must either be moved or
postponed. Thus the offering of three or
tour films a weekend will be quite
welcome.

Suggestions, complaints or other con-
structive comments are welcome and en.
couraged. Under the guidance of movie
buff Katz, there should be a wide range of
cinematic otterings appealing to all types

TOMORROW'S CONCERT. . . His name is
Eddy Harington, but when he came to .
Chicago in the early 1950’s his friends namv
ed him Clear Waters, their answer to Mud~
dy Waters Today, Eddy Clearwater is one
of Chicago’s most exciting blues artists.
Saturday night at 7:30 pm. on Mac Field,
he kicks off this year’s concerts program
in style.

Clearwater was born in Macon,
Mississippi in 1935, moved to Chicago and
since then has developed a solid reputa-
tion. He is widely acclaimed in Europe
lwhere he plays to sellout crowds regular
y.

what distinguishes Clearwater from
many other blues artisk is that in addition
to straight blues, he knows how to rock.
Borrowing from blues artists like Elmore
James to rockers like Chuck Berry, this
man brings the house down everywhere he
plays. His performances at Chicagofest
over the past several years have had peer
ple dancing on their seats, in the aisles,
and screaming for more.

Saturday night should be no exception.
Clearwater loves playing outdoors, and the
temperature will be rising as the sun goes
down. Anyone who likes rockin’ blues, and
loves to dance should not miss this show.
