A Challenge

We’ve got it What shall we do with it?

We mean the Student Council. It’s inventory tilne
everywhere. This seems like an opportune tilne to take a
mind-inventory of our student government. The time is!
ripe because the potential candidates for the leadership of
that government should be giving it serious consideration

First: Is a Student Council worth the time and
effort expended on it? Can its leaders guide it to a
position of real leadership?

Second: Where does this body politic stand? Is
its function a representation of the will of the majori-
ty of the student body? Is its function a representa-
tion of the feelings of many factions of the students
to the faculty and administration? Is its function to
make or to accept administrative regulations?

Third: Seriously, should we even have a Student
Council?

The Scarlet and Black believes firmly ill government
by the students. It believes students can be entrusted with
responsible jobs. They can carry out jobs with greater sat-
isfaction and understanding of the people touched by the
official administration of the college, an, administration
whose duties are often detached from close student con
tact.

The administration apparently approved the same idea
in allowing student government in the first place.

The question is: Do the candidates for Student Coun-
cil president themselves believe in a student government?

While the petitions are circulating, the excitement of ‘
a campaign is on, and a Let‘s Draft So-and-So bandwagon
starts rolling it is easy to roll along- with it, But are the
people‘who are going to be caught up in the wave of this
year’s campaign going to be thinking seriously about the
operation of this student government which may be en-
trusted to their hands? Or are they going to be so blinded
by the glory of it that the glamour of hall machinations,
smoke filled rooms, vivid posters, and dinner table novel-
ties shove the real aims in running for office into the back-
ground‘.7

It can happen here. It has happened in the cases of
many candidates in previous years. This is a challenge to
the potential candidates. If they start out NOW trying to
fashion a workable mold for the Student Council, recog-
nizing its limits and attempting to extend them where ad-
visable, what will result?

Something New Added

It hasn‘t happened in thirty years—maybe longer. All
our S and B files show that we’re to have the first co-
editorship of the S and B in all the time that we’ve been
saving S and B’s.

And a potent co-editorship it should be! Charniayne
Wilke and Diane Powell with their varied types of jour-
nahstic experience should be able to add new ideas and
highly competent managership to the paper.

Diane, a winning transfer student from South Dako-
ta State, has sniffed the printers‘ ink professionally at the
Slouxdil‘alls Daily Argus Leader and weekly Forum as well
as originating a paper for teen-agers and working as ac—
thlty editor on her college paper. Charmayne knows not
only the ins and outs of the S and B as well as the intri-
cacies of a kitchen (best cook on campusl), but three years
Work in the president’s office have given her a sound basis
for understanding college affairs.

Week by week subtle changes will be infiltrating into
the columns of the S and B. The New Inﬂuence will be a
good one. The Scarlet and Black is looking forward to a
year of campus leadership under the new combination.

CLAIRE’S C

By Jan Reinke

“Hey, let’s have El party.”

The cry goes up at housemeet-
ing, and the assembled mob
locks around for the Social chairsl
Inan. He’s found huddled in a]
corner moaning, “No, not that
againl I can’t go through that
againianything but that." After
SCVel‘al friendly gouges in the
ribs, he changes his mind andi
decides that It Can’t all be as bad
as last time, He will plan a‘
party.

Next weekethni would be a
nice time for a party. Unheuh!
The dance permitia weighty
documentimust be obtained at
least two weeks before the
party and must be handed in
to the social committee ten days
before. Two weeks from now—
that would be a nice time for a

_ party.

Permit Problems

And now, the dance permit.
The social chairman takes a deep
breath, a sharp pencil, and be-
gins filling the blank. What

FATE or THE LIBRARY?
bar Editor: _

Thcre was a time when li-
braries were considered the
hearts of universities and col.
leges, the cortex of learning. At
Grinnell, our library seems to
assume o lower function, that
of the liver perhaps (a cancer-
ous liver), or of the gall blad-
der. .

The leprous walls back in the
stacks, where books are ruined
every time a thaw comes or it
rains, and the overheated, un-
comfortable study rooms where
every whisper can be heard, at
if not with learning, with the
test to someone’s lack of concern,
most Vital physical aspects of
that process.

1 cannot understand why there.
is a more pressing need for a
new men's dormitory, or a new
science building, or, God help
us, a refurbishing of the chapel,.
than for repairs on the library;
the need must be there, though;
the administration is noted for
doing first things first. But i
should like to put in a plea
that, sometime, maybe next
summer. or next fall, the larger-
holes in the library roof be
plugged up, before Shakespeare
becomes waterlogged and Goethe
drowns,

Most sincerely
John Durham

A PLEA FOR CANDIDATES
Dear Editor:
, I wonder how many supposeds
'ly mature, intelligent, and demr
ocratl'c Grinnelllans on this sup-
posedly progressive campus read
and thought about, even momen-
tarily, the editorial in last week’s
s & B about the coming student
‘council election? Undoubtedly,
we will learn ihe answer by the
number of petitions turned in
for candidates; and if that nuxn—
bei~ is as pitifully small as it
was last year, the answer will
be a said one indeed.

That editorial was a plea to
us, the student body; it should
also be a challenge. Are we so
immature, complacent, and stag»
neni that we cannot express
ourselves in the most important
sphere of Grinnell life? How
righteously indignant we‘d be if
the administrationn chose two or
three students for us to vote
upon, yet they might just as
well since we seem incapable of

 

kind of activity? Where? Who?
When? How much money will
be spent? Spot lights? How
about lamps, PA system, punch
bowls. pianos and maids? And
who oie facility guests?

Faculty guests? Our social
chairman pulls out his or the
hall’s best stationery and lab-
oriously writes to faculty mem-
hers—«if one couple doesn’t r
dance, there must be another
nondancing‘ couple in provide ,
company.

The next day, a phone call;
must be made to check onl
RSVP’s, and the following day,
to arrange for transportation and
baby sitters. After these details
are cleared up, the filling of the
permit can continue. .

Sign Here, Please

The social chairman’s next
task is to get the permit ap-.
proved. He must clomp over to
Messrs, to the office of the dis
rectors of foods, Next, a stop at,
the heating plant for the signs-I
tures of the executive house-

least, we have so far!

Where are the students who
have worked, since freshmen, on
and with the student council and
now, know rules procedures, and}
methods? Who are these sturl
dents, male AND female. who
are the most qualified among us
to run for council president? I
feel that it is our duty and
privilege to find these people.
know these people, then run and
back them for the highest office
on campus; after all, they will‘
be running for us, backing OUR,
ideas, and representing us. We:

keeper and the superintendent of
buildings and grounds is neces-
sary. Then, back to the Quad,
the social chairman takes the
blank to the ofﬁce of the dean
of women. chairman of the 507
cial committee.

Our social chairman chooses
a theme for the party—help»

cinl functions pamphlet—and
Starts looking around for dec-
oration ideas and materials.

like 500 small cardboard hearts.
corrugated paper (2% rolls light
pink zebra), 6 garden scenes,
tassels for programs (1 handful).

Only after decorations, refresh—
ments, permits. guests, equip-
ment, and a multitude of other
details are straightened out, our
hero and his organization may
have the party.

New Program

To Tell Men

Speaking at freshman orientas

will be representatives from the
different branches of the armed
forces. This new program is be-
ing instituted so that Grinnell
men may have an insight into
the different branches of the
service which may aid them in
making a choice of service.

IN THE NICK OF TIME .

To the Editor: ‘

Although I recognize the value
of levity and comic relief in
these serious times, I wonder if‘
during the playing of “The Star,
Spangled Banner” before thei
basketball games is the propel“
time to induce it? In case you!
haven't guessed what i mean,
have you ever heard the flag-
raising before a game? It sounds
worse than my jalopy on a cold
morning. I wonder what visit-‘
ing fans and teams think? Do‘
they think we are too cheap to
buy a can of 3 in 1. Perhaps
they think we’re all deaf, or,
have no respect for the Flag‘
ceremony, or are scared to climb:
up there. if Building and[
Grounds has no answer or no
time, I hereby tender my serv-i
ices, All I need is the ladder,
rll even furnish the oil. l

Sincerely,
Lionel Oberlin

Grinnell’s male population will
be in uniform by this June. “it
Simply means," explained Dean
Duke. ”that those men who have
reason to believe that they will
be inducted into the armed
forces may know‘ a little about
what they will find there, and
how they may use their educa-
tion to benefit them."

The speaker next Tuesday
will be Capt. Edward L. Fos-
sum, USMC, from the recruit»
ing service in Des Moines. He
said, in a telephone conversa-
tion with Dean Duke, that he
would emphasize especially
how a college education would
benefit a marine recruit,

Dean Duke made a point of
saying that this new orientation
program is not limited to fresh.
men. Any upperclassman who
has the hour at 9:00 am. on
Tuesday open may attend the
meeting. For the freshmen, how-
ever, orientation is still compul-
ory.

At times, the speakers will be
members of the faculty who saw

service during World War H,‘
(such as Mr. John Pfitsch (phys.

ed.) who served in the army.
