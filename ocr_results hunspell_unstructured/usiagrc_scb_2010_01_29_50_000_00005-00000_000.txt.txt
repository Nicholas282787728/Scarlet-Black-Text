New Grinnell Public Safety Building opens

Facility funded by Local Sales Tax Option, uses LEED construction Iguidlines

Bv MAX CALENBERG

on Tuesday Jan. 19, the brand new Grinnell Public Safety
Building opened at 102i) Spring St, replacing the previous lo—
cation which was over 50 years old. The facility, which now
houses both the Grinnell Police and Fire Departments, was
funded by a Local option sales Tax that passed in 2006. The
new Drake Library as well as the Aquatic Center were also
partly funded by the tax.

The buildings'si, 000 square feet feature many improve-
ments from previous headquarters including a better integra»
tion of technology, increased safety and increased ease of access
to equipment. Even with the extra space, some improvements
will disperse the police force as policemen will now be able to
file reports from their cars instead of having to come into the

they are already out In their ears, Police Chief Jody Matherly
said in a phone interview so keeping them from having to
come into the office frequently is a big admntdgc." .

From a safety standpoint, the building does a much better
job’ofkeeping'those jalled in the facility and civilians separate
than does the previous Department Headquarters.

Additionally volunteer ﬁreﬁghters, who would often sleep
in the trucks, now have bunk rooms to sleep in during their
overnight shifts. Designers gave the fire fighters adequate space

to store the squad’s seven trucks in the Apparatus Bay, visible
from West Street, while still having access each one without
any maneuvering They even have room to spare

“The other night when' it snowed we were able to even pull
the [police] patrol cars into the bay so they wouldnt get covered
with frost and snow, ”Fire Chief Dan Sicard said' in a phone
interview.

Mayor ofGrinnell Gordon R. Canﬁeld is pleased with both
the efficiency with which the construction took pluce‘iit was
completed on time and within its budgetﬂnd with the envie
ronmental standards it followed as Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design guidelines were followed. some of this
is due to the fact that instead of building a new structure, the
old Fareway Supermarket building was altered.

“By resusing an existing structure and only adding the ﬁre
truck hay, use of time, money and use of new materials was
greatly reduced. It employs the latest groundssource geothers

mal heating and cooling systems and energy efficient lighting."

Canﬁeld wrote in an e-mail. Grinnell area residents can be
justly proud of their new Grinnell Public Safety Building... it
is a good example of green building techniques being used for
a municipal facility expected to serve for well into the future."

There will be a grand opening ceremony a yet to be deter
mined date, featuring bag pipes, speeches and tours.
