TALKS 0N GRANT OF POWER

President Main Discusses Princi-
ples Back of Recent Action.

Pl‘eisdelit Mum's chapel tall; Monday
morning dcalt partly with the "(limit
or Powers" which has been made to
the SelﬁGorerllmolit League Mr.
Main said that it was not his Irclict
that people should be Forced to do what
they ought to do. but that they should
do things on their own responsibility.
This is the principle upon which at-
lairs turn in Grinncll. The honor and
discretion of the students are and
should be depended upon to maintain
traditions as wall as to define or mod-
iiy them.

Someone has said that all college
should teach men and women to be
ladies and gentlemen, This is as true
here as much as anywhere. Women
are a power in the home, and they
should also be a power iii all social
me. it is for them to shape the
standards of the college in this re-
sheet,
