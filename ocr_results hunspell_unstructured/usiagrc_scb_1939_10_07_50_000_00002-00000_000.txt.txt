THE PRESIDENT DINES

Last Tuesday night, the first president’s
dinner since 1929 was held in the men’s
dining room, under the auspices of the
Council of House Presidents.

Here, at last, is an intelligent effort to
augment the natural ties which should
exist between the administration and the
student body Instead of irresponsible
criticism, we have a conscious attempt to
afford the men of Grinnell with an oppor»
tunity to meet on a common ground the
man, who more than any other individual,
controls the destiny of this college.

And, after all, isn’t that one of the most
sensible ways of working for a greater
Grinnell‘.7 It may be true, as we have said,
that the administration plays the dominant
role in determining the future of the college,
but it is equally true that the administration
can not build a better Grinnell alone, That
can be done only by the administration and
the students,

To achieve this cooperation, however,
calls for the preliminary step of under-
standing. And it is in taking that prelim-
inary step that lies the cardinal value of the
president‘s dinner. Without it we can not
hope to attain the second step, cooperation,
which is the key to our common goal, a
finer Glinnell.

To the Council of House Presidents, the
Scarlet and Black offers its congratulations
for a plan well conceived and ably executed.
And to President Nollen and to Mrs. Nollen
we extend, on behalf of the men of Griunell,
a cordial invitation to be with us again.
Grinnell college is one of tradition, and
here, certainly, is a custom which should
take its place once more as a part of that

tradition,

CITIZENS 0F TH WORLD

The possibility, which cannot be ignored,
that the United States may eventually be
drawn into the present World conﬂict is a
frightening and bewildering one. Grinncll
College students are unanimously opposed to
.such a move. What, then, can we do to
prepare and strengthen ourselves to combat
United States participation in World War
II?

Fortunately, Grinnell College has recog-
nized for some time the importance of pro-
viding a meeting place for all students in
terested in international affairs to assemble,
discuss, and form enlightened opinions on
world events. Thus did the Grinnell Inter»
national Relations club come into being,
thus did it grow and flourish, until particu-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

larly at the present time it has become an
invaluable organization (in the campus. Here
discussion, which is all too often aimless
and futile, is stimulated and directed by
guest speakers until it becomes intelligent
and informative. To provide a concrete
example, let us consider the following.

It is generally recognized that no legisla-
tion of any kind will absolutely guarantee
our neutrality in a world of warring nations.
Moreover, the United States will never dc-
clale war unless public opinion, i fluenced
by propaganda, demands it. Realizing this,
the International Relations club will offer a
series of reports in the near future analyz—
ing the sources of propaganda and its effi—
cacy, and recommending the proper safe-
guards against it.

On October 27th and 28th the Grinnell
international Relations club is sponsoring
its ninth annual conference on the campus.
Delegates from colleges and universities in
Iowa and surrounding states will gather to
hear such authoritative and renowned
speakers as Joseph Lash, execiltiversecrev
tary of the American Student Union, and
Kirby Page, at one time Contributing Editor
of “The Christian Century.” Here they will
participate in intelligent and thoughteprzr
Voking discussions which will help them
clarify for themselves the problems of the

world and their possible solutions

TOO MUCH DANCING!

"THE EYES OF THE WHOLE COLLEGE
COMMUNITY ARE UPON THE CLASS OF
1911i WHAT WILL THEY DO ABOUT
THE DANCING PROBLEM? CLASS MEMr
BERS BE OUT AND VOTE AT OUR
MEETING TUESDAY NIGHT!"

This advertisement appeared in the Jan-
uary 21, 1911, issue of the Scarlet and
Black The results of this momentous
meeting appeared in the January 25 edition.

”Resolved: That the sentiment of the
class of 1911 is opposed to the recognition
of dancing officially by any organization of
Grinnell College."

Today at Grinllell we have quite a differ-
ent problem. The typical dates are as fol-
lows: Friday night, dancing at open house;
Saturday night, varsity, formal dance, or
house party; Sunday night and week nights,
dancing at the Raven or White House.
About the only other chance for group fun
is cards at the White House, This type of
social program is all right for those who ens
joy dancing and are good at it. Even these
people get tired of dancing some times.

The question of what to do about this is
a difficult one. Of course no one on the
editorial board would be ill favor of abolish-
ing dancing altogether or even reducing
the number of dances. However, a little
more variety in the kinds of social functions
would help to give all the students including
the non-dancers a chance to enter into the
social life on, our campus. One type of
party that can either be a complete success
or a miserable failure is the type where
games are played or folk dancing enjoyed.
Attempts have been made to hold class par-
tlcs where this type of entertainment is
used and most of these have been failures
Last Saturday night, however, a party was
sponsored by the Fellowship Club at which
fun was had by all. The program consisted
of folk dancing, games and refreshments.

If more affairs were held like this, we
would have a social program at Grinnell
in which all could participate instead of only
those who can dal e well.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)
"In these troublous times, democracy’s
strongest safeguard against the inroads of
totalitarian philosophies is education. At
this very moment the traditional values of
our civilization are being challenged, and
the colleges and schools of the country will
have to assume a more important role than
ever before in gill 'ng our youth to examine
intelligently our culture of the past, and
more particularly, the events and move,
ments of today." College of the City of
New York’s Pres. Nelson P. Mead states all
important preface to another year of higher
education.

‘l94o Rhodes

Examinations

Are Cancelled

European Struggle
Causes Suspension

Of Scholarships

Examinations and elections for
Rhodes scholarships, scheduled for
December of this year, will be
cancelled, according to a letterrev
solved by Prof Edward B. T.
Spencer from Frank Aydelotte,
American secretary for the
awards.

Scholarships how in eriect will
be suspended until after the war,
but an effort will he made to keep
the organization intact during the
period of suspension in order to
be ready to resume competition at
the close of the present conflict.

Relatives and friends of students
how in England have been warned
that some delay in return of schol-
ars may be expected because of
war-time conditions at sea.

Until this year, four men, from
among the hundreds or college ac—
plicants throughout the United
states, have been chosen to re—
ceive the $2,000 awards at Oxford
university. The scholarship fund
was established by Cecil Rhodes.
who left his entire fortune to es-
tablish scholarships tor students
rrom other countries in order that
more friendly relations might be
established among nations.
