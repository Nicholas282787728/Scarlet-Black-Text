more quickly than the students can

ﬁescribe drugs, or anything else

, that requires a doctor's superr
vision or signature. As in past
years, in case oi emergency, the
regular doctor on call at Grinnell
Hospital is contacted.

Nurses are on duty from 8 a.m. to
ti pm. Mondays through Fridays,
and Saturdays in am. to 3 p.m.
During the rest of the time, student
clerks are present. The clerks can
answer phones, talk to students,
and call a doctor or arrange for
free transportation to the hospital
when necessary, but they cannot so
much as give out a bandaid or

ﬁiorm any other duties of a
nurse. Clerks on duty during the
midnight to B a.rn, shift are allowed
to sleep at the Center. According to
Hall, few clerks have had their

eep disturbed by phone calls or
Visitors.

If an'ill student comes in or
calls, the clerk can tell him or her
to wait until the nurse comes in the
morning, or call the hospital.
Students who are sick or have even
a slight [ever cannot sleep in the
Health Center overnight because
the college is worried about
liability and insurance problems.
The only patients allowed to sleep
overnight are students who are

‘éred and need a quiet place to stay.

committee is looking into the
possibility oi opening the Center at
night for people with minor
illnesses. “It’s my biggest con-
cem," said Looye, who is coor»
dinator of the student night clerks.
“People have complained about
this to me." She added that Dr.
James Paulson, medical advisor to
the college, had advised that
patients be allowed to stay over-
night, and learned only recently
that they cannot. “I’m upset that
people can't stay over there,"
Looye said.

Looye has mixed results about
the worth of a student clerk
program. “The clerks are not
being used very much.” Essen-
tially, she said, “they can’t do
anything." Due to this situation,
”The clerks are frustrated . . . it’s
immensely irustrating for me.”

However. she believes that the
system is “much, much better"
than closing down completely at
night. ”It functions as a central
location . . . the people ,who are
clerks know what to do" in case of
an emergency. ”It’s worthwhile
just in case." she said.

Hall expressed the Same
feelings. “It is possible that it could
work without the students," she
said. When asked if the night clerk
system was a waste of money, she
replied, “I don’t think it was for
this year . . .We probably could get
by without it. But by having the
students here, we‘re doing a little
better than getting by. We have not
had any Critical situations arise.”
If an epidemic should occuri
nurses will be put back on 24-hour
duty.

The student clerks are doing a
good job, Hall believes, “They
have done so Well this year, they‘ve
really surprised me.“ she said.
“They’re doing very well. I was
very panic stricken when I heard
there would be such a gross
change.“

Many members of the sub
committee feel that the Health
Service can he more of a service to
the students without a great in-
crease in the budget, ”It’s doing an
adequate job, but barely that,”
said Doernhoeter. “The biggest

felt need right now concerns
women’s health."

Around 150 women responded to
the gynecological survey the sub
committee distributed last
semester. Student concern ex
pressed on ﬁlis questionnaire led to
the institution of the pregnancy
testing program, which Started
last Tuesday. Four women were
tested on the ﬁrst day.

Members of the subcommittee
are Working on other women’s
health projects, prompted by the
survey responses. Students in-
dicated that because of the time
and money involved, they are not
utilizing the collegeprovided
transportation to a D5 Moines
gynecologist, Dr. Fong. Committee
members are looking into altera
natives.

Other ideas suggested include
sponsoring workshops in the areas
of nutrition, basic first aid, and
general health care. Looye
suggested that the Health Service
might work in conjunction with the
Sexuality Resource Group or me
Food Service to sponsor certain
programs. .

The committee plans to Conduct
a campus-wide survey to elicit
student opinion on how the health
center might be improved.

Members of the committee are
concerned about the lack of student
involvement in or awareness oi
the Health Service. Looye laments
the general attitude of the students
toward the Service. It is un-
derutilized in part, she says,
because students have stopped
considering the Health Service as
an accessible alternative when
planning their health needs. “That
kind of lack of trust, and the [eeling
that the Health Center is not the
place to go, is a distressing
change," she said.

According to committee member
Linda Cornelius, the Service is
performing a valuable iunction,
even in its reduced form. “We
can't and we won‘t ever have the
kind of service a large university
can provide, (but) ,. . I don’t think
we should give up on it and close it
down, as some people have
suggested."
