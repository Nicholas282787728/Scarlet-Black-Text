optimisticabouldiisyearnndthinks
that this team has the potential to
turn the situation around.

“We need to spend a little more
time working on learn chemistry."
Arscnault said. “but the talent is
definitely there. as is the individual
style of the players.“

Assoonaseverything falls into
place, the Pioneers should be in for
a very competitive season.

The Pioneers have seven re-
turning lettennen on the team, as
well as six freshmen. The fresh4
men are expected to fitin well with
Arsenault‘s grime plan. Pioneer
fans can expect to see the men con-
trol the tempo of the game with
constant press situations, a move
thtitArscntiult hopes “will force the
OppOSillun Out of their offensc."

“It may be a gamble, but it‘s a
necessary gullible in order to score
as mtmy points as we would like to
score each game,"

Thisyelir' 'nc-upwill include
quite a hit of rotation and substitu-
lion. CenterChris Jacobscttguartl

Holland Neal and freshman point
guard Todd Young will provide a
solid core for the Pioneers, but ace

restofthc line»upis still undecided.
The team has tremendous depth,
and itappears that mostofthe men
will be seeing quite abitofplaying

Arsenault expects the team to
be competitive this yetir, both in
and outof the conference ifitplnys

the gun went off, and 120 runners

The pack of runners thinned as

women kept their own pack, with
runners two through seven ﬁnishr

Kata Beach led the pack, with a

season and lifetime best of 20:20,
while Deanna Sand brought up the
rear of the pack in 21:21, also a
season best.

the team willhostits annualTiproff
Toumament, and will start on Fri
day with a nintchup against NAIA
Diviston lI Mundelien.

Gustavus Adolphus and Mount
Saint Claire also play on Friday,
and lhewlnncrs ofthese games will
meet on Saturday so that a tout-na-
mcnt champion can be named,

The Pioneers are eurrently
”lihetiti of where we were last year
til this pnlnf," according to Conch
Eskiltlsen. The team is starting to

tem works.

Last year, it worked at 90 de-
gree angles, and penetrated the de-
fense with the pass. and this year, it
has adjusted to working at forty-
five degree angles and penetrating
with the dribble.

There are several players whom
Coach Eskildsen believes have the
potential to become offenstve
threats with this system. Missy
Sharer, who was the number one
Division III ll‘trCCrpOtnt shooter in
