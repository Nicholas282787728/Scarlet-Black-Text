Gephaﬁ

by John Newmark

As the days have drawn nearer
and nearer to Feb. 8, you may have
asked yourseli a iew times how a

,single student can gather and
'digest enough iniormation about
each and every candidate in such a
short time and still be able
thoughtfully and logically to
choose the best candidate? It
would be ideal it we could find peo-
ple who have lived and worked
with the candidates for at least a
iew years, who have had time to
examine many oi the candidates
closely, and iind out who they sup-
port, A congressman or senator is
not likely to “step out on a limb"
ior one oi his peers ior iear oi
alienating himseli from other
members oi Congress. Therefore,
you don't iind too many members
supporting individual candidates,
With one exception: Rep. Richard
A. Gephardt.

Eighty-live members irom both
the Senate and the House have or
iered their support ior Gephardt's
candidacy. That is more than Bush
or Dole received from the
Republicans, it is also more than
Simon and Gore have received
from the Democrats. Nor have i
seen many governors stating their
support for Babbit or Dukakis,
Why do all these senators and
representatives ieel that Gephardt
would make a better president
than the iz other candidates on the
ballot” The answer is simple. They
have watched him in the House
since his rookie year in 197s, and
they are impressed with his
energy, his skill, and his vision ior
America,

in his first year in Congress
Gephardt was named to the House
Budget Committee, where he serv-
ed ior the maximumrallowed
threee terms. and the House Ways
and Means Committee, Where he
continues to serve today, In 1954 he
was the iounding chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council.
Gephardt is also the chairman oi
the House Democratic Caucus. and
he's the iourthranking Democrat
in the chamber. He’s the youngest
member ever to achieve the honor,
and the only one elected
unanimously in the history oi the
Congress. Rep, Thomas Foley, ma7
jority leader or the House or
Representatives, said that “for
more than 16 years in public liie,
Dick Gephardt has been ahead oi
the curve, He always seems to
know ahead of time what’s around
the corner, what to do next. And
then, he gets the job done. He’s a
remarkable leader." A
remarkable leader,

Finally, let's take a look at
Gephardt's record. Get a glimpse
ior yourseli at what his vision for
America consists oi. The Bradley-
Gephardt Fair Tax Act, which pav-
ed the way ior tax reform; the
Kennedy~Gepliardt Medicare bill;
the Gephardt Trade Amendment
that seeks to open presently closed
global markets for American pro-
ducts; the Schroeder-Gephardt
bill, which calls [or a nuclear test
ban; the Harkin-Gephardt “Save
the Family Farm" bill; the Pay
Equity Act, which Gephardt co»
sponsored; the Equal Rights
Amendment, which he {ought to
reintroduce; the $1 billion in
educational iunding for math.
science, and languages. which
Gephardt was instrumental in obr
taming; and the iight against cons
tra aid, of which he has been a

leader _ since 1933 ch
caucus night, February 3, when
you vote ior the iuture oi Ameri ,
vote for one oi the most eiicctive
leaders in Congress ior the past
decade, Rep, Richard Gepliardt.

or less on why someone should vote
ior Sen, Paul Simon. in that
amount oi words. i can only tell
you why I‘m voting ior Paul
Simon. Like most oi the
Democratic candidates, he's com-
mitted to arms control, iarm
iamilies, senior citizens, and
education, (He's at the head oi the
pack irphis commitment to educa
tion. His liretime NEA rating is to
percent, higher than any other can-
didate.) But I’m voting ior him
because ot his record in civil
rights, women‘s issues, the en7
vironment. and what i believe is
his ability to win in November.

Civil Rights Martin Luther King
invited him to speak at the Mon»
tgomery bus boycott anniversary
in 1957. ~ He was the iirst white
congressman to appoint a black

oi 1987 which would make materni-
ty and childcare leaves the law oi
the land, . He was chiei sponsor oi
the Civil Rights Restoration Act in
the House, v He supported extenr
sicn ior ERA ratification and has

supported every ERA introduced '

since, * He opposes constitutional
amendments to take away a
woman's right to make up her
mind on abortion, ' He sponsored
the first Child Abuse and Family
Violence Act,

The Environment He is a leading
Critic oi lax EPA enforcement and

by Steve Hingtgen

Hendrik Hertzberg or The New
Republic says that Bruce Babbitt.
has “the supplest mind, the most
coherent and interesting set oi pro-
posals, and the most impressive
record in public ofiice." Kirk
O'Donnell, president or the Center
ior National Policy says that Bab-
bitt has f‘conironted tough issues
with credible proposals." And
UMass proiessor Ralph Whitehead
says Babbitt “is beginning to set
the intellectual standard tor the
campaign "

Governor Bruce Babbitt is a dilr
iereiii kind oi candidate. Babbitt
believes that ii a candidate doesn't
have the courage to tight speciob
interest groups and say unpopular
things in the campaign. then we
shouldn't expect him to have the

.63 ll]

courage to stand up to the lobbyists
and specialzinterest groups once he
is elected. It‘s that simple. And
unlike the other candidates, Bab-
bitt doesn't live in a makerbelieve
world oi easy answers. The world
and its problems are complicated
and it takes an honest, courageous,
intellectual person to change the
system, Babbitt has demonstrated
these qualities.

But Babbitt's true strength lies
in the issues, As president, here
are just a tow oi the things Babbitt
would do,

— implement a plan to cut
deiense an average or $16.81 billion
per year over the next iive years,
support a test ban treaty, a
Ell-percent reduction in oiiensive
weapons, cancellations oi the Mx
missile. and Slowdown oi Trident

Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking
Water Act, and the Resources.

Everyone has heard oi Donna
Rice, the trip to Bimini, and 7 at
least in some part 7 the debate
over personal judgment. From
what i have heard around campus
and in town, many people have
already made up their minds about
Gary Hart. it is obvious he made
mistakes 7 that goes without say-
ing. But at the same time, many oi
the people whom Hart talked to
last week were impressed, or at
least interested, by what he had to
say The senator brought his plat7
form of “New Ideas” to Grinnell in
the (arm of a Mpage booklet, his
‘hlueprint' ior the proposed Hart
Administration, and the first drait
of a budget, both the result oi his 15
years as a United States senator.

Uniortunately, most people were
unable to see this booklet. lel alone
geta hold oi a Copy, There is no
way i could present Harts "New
Ideas" ill a Illurb like this without
its sounding like sweeping
generalities ul campaign rhetoric.
Both the issues and Hart's
responses to them are much too
complex: ior llint. in politics, thcrc

is rarely such a thing as the simple
solution, despite what Ronald
Reagan might believe

A vote ior Hart is essentially a
vote for his booklet and what it
says about domestic and military
reiorm, investment in what is to be
America’s third century, and the
establishment oi a ioreign policy
that does not rely on outdated
global perceptions oi the '405 and
‘50:.

Despite considerable delay. 1
have been able to obtain numerous
copies oi the Hart piatiorm booklet

Hart's political judgment can con-

interested in Hart, i doubt there is
much i could say hcrc to change

new ideas. take a look at the

“No generation can choose the
age or circumstances in which it is
born. but through leadership it
can choose to make [that age onei
oi enlightenment 7 an age oi jobs,
peace, and justice." 7 Jesse
Jackson

Jackson's political career em-
bodies the quest ior these three
goals. First is his quest ior jobsn,
Jesse is committed to stopping the
night oi decent-salaried American
jobs to third~world countries at
slaverlevel labor conditions
Through taxation and regulation
he will discourage American
multinationals irom these actions.
Jackson supports the Family
Farm Act. a comprehensive
system oi price iloors, debt
restructuring. and market expan~
sion. Jackson plans to insure the
iuture oi these jobs by doubling
Americans iinancial commitment
to education.

0n issues oi peace and justice,
Jackson stands now, as always, on
the point oi challenge. with ex.
perience stretching hack to his
work alongside Dr. King, he has
proven his commitment to civil
rights. Recently Jackson
demonstrated his support oi the
Lesbian/Gay civil Rights Bill at
October‘s March on Washington
and his opposition to South Airican
apartheid and intervention in Cenr
tral America at April's rally, He
has actively supported responsible
negotiations toward a regional
solution to the lsraeli/Raiestinian
conilict. Jackson's political record
has consistently demonstrated his
commitment to peace and justice
at home and abroad.

Yet while Jackson is the best
candidate in all these areas. two
common rescrvaiio -cinain The
iirst is that he has not held an

Feb. 5, 1988

elected political oiiice; his ex-
perience. however, is not bounded
by this delinition, but rather lies in
the civil rights movement, where
both he personally and several oi
his organizations have long been
iniluential. The second argument
is that he is uneiectable, Quite the
contrary, he is the most electable
Democrat, ior he is the only one
who can break the Republican
electoral lock in the South while re-
maining a truly viable candidate
throughout the rest oi the nation.
As Jackson himseli says. "Your
president must be courageous. and
so must you." 7 Students ior

DukakE

by Paula Rings

Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis is the most elecr
table of all the Democratic cans
‘ He has ciiicient, solid

and to Republicans who are led up
with the current administration
but he remains socially pr0v
grcssive and maintains idealism
that works, thus appealing to a
wide selection of Democrats.

l-lis tremendous success in
Massachusetts is proof of his abi r
ty in government. when Dukakis
was elected, he inherited a $500,000
budget deiicit irom the Republican
administration, He has submitted
a balanced budget to Congress
every year, erased the deiicit. and
done so-without raising taxes, in
tact, taxes have been cut five
times. One of his ideas to increase
revenue is to collect unpaid taxes
This proposal has received
criticism from other candidates,
but the {acts speak ior themselves.
Tax compliance has dropped from
98 to 83 percent during the last
decade, The lRS audit rate has
dropped irom one in two to one in
four. Simply returning to the
earlier eiiiciency will bring in
billions of dollars; collecting the
unpaid back taxes will do the
same.

Socially. Dukakis is incredibly
progressive. He is pru£hoice and
prorERA. He supports government
iunding ior abortions. Fiityrl'our
percent or his Massachusetts apr
pointments have gone to women,
including Cabinet positions. The
Duke supports banning sexual-
preierence bias ior adoption and
iostercare programs He supports
iunding ior AIDS in many areas-
research, education, and health
care He believes international
cooperation is ital in curbing liic
epidemic. In addition. Dukakis
recently become the first governor
to introduce a universal health
care plan ior every citizen in his
state.
