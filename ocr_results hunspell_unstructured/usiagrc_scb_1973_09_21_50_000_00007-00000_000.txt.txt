Hitchhiking

but under the provisions of the
Guest Statute Law, the driver of
a vehicle cannot be sued tor negli-
gence. This means that it you are
picked up by someone who absent,
mindedly runs a stop sign, you
haven’t a legal leg to stand on it
you are hurt.

When asked what advice he would
give to hitchhikers, Grinnell Police
Chiet Bill Peters replied, “l don’t
think I'd hitchhike if I was a girl,
Chances might be better with a boy
or even another girl I'd have to
want to go someplace really bad.”
Recently a girl Irom Arlington,
Virginia was raped in an Iowa coun.
ty She had been hitchhiking when
a truckdriver picked her up in
Joliet, Illinois. He left the girl at
the Grinnell exit on Interstate 80,
and is yet to be apprehended.

It goes without saying that hitch-
hiking does involve chances to those
involved, but the decision ultimately
is that or each person. Is the need
worth the risks?

Magazine Reatiled For Break

by Lynn Voedisch
Once again, Grinnell Will have a
literary mazazme in bond ride ma-
gazine Iorm, as opposed to the new5s
letter term at last year's Brevity.
Sue Steinwall, this year’s editor,
and Several other interested stud-
ents, are planning publication oi
a quarterly booklet as a forum for

Abortion loans Available

A small abortion loan fund is aVr
allahle to Grinnell students aS part
of an overall problem pregnancy
counselling service, according to
Dennis Haas college Chaplain.

Haas stressed that abortion is only
one of a number OI options available
to a woman lacing a problem preg-
nancy, He adds that the key to a re.
sponsible decision in this area is
proper use oi the counselling ser
vices available on the campus

Haas listed resident advisers, the
Student Altair: Otfice, and mem-
bers Of the Sexuality Committee
as possible counsellors [or those
facing a problem pregnancy.

All these counsellors have contacts
with agencies and facilities needed
if adoption or some other option Is
the eventual decision of the preg- ,
nant woman.

The abortion loan fund, now in
its second year, is designed to pre»
vent a delay in having an abortion
ior someone who has made a "re-
sponsible decision” to do so, said
Haasi Delay, he added, makes the
abortion more difficult,

No use has been made of the fund

NOTICE:

to date. It was iouhded by an an-
onymous donor, and is designed
primarily to help Iinance abortions
which are being partially paid for
through other sources, Haas Said

the Iund is small enough that it ‘

could not ilnance two abortions in
full at the same time.

Townspeople can also make use
or the fund, although tirst priority
is given to college students. All
iund users are expected to repay
the loan.
