The tour organizers asked Drake to
speak to the gathered students and the
president did come out of his utilize to
answer students‘ questions for over one-
half hour One of the ﬁrst questions asked
was about the details 01 why Magurshak

was not recommended lor tenure Drake
replied that he could not talk about the para
iiculars oi the decision, that it was a mat
ter oi personal privacy.

other questions included the number or
tenured teachers and at what point the
Board or Trustees becomes worried about
that number, how the tenure policy Will alr
lect Grinnell‘s attraction [or prospective
lacuity and what precedents there have

been [or tenure appeal reversing a recoma

mendation decision,

Drake said that there is no quota tor the
number at tenured protessors Grinnell can
have but the college could end up with 70 to
80 percent at its faculty tenured. That
situation would make the iaculty top heavy
as far as costs are concerned The costs of
paying that many tenured protessors
would revert back to the students evenr
tually. He said in the next iew years one
quarter of the iaculty will be up tor tenure

The president does not think the tenure

policy will be adverse to crinnelrs attl'ac~'

tion [or new teachers. Rather than
discouraging people in trying to gain
tenure here, Drake feels the College will
draw better people by havtng a "tough
tenure" policy.

Walker answered the query on appeal
precedents saying there “have been ap-
peals that overturned the lrecommenda-
tionl deClsion." He could not remember
any speciiic examples. though, There have
been "several times" when the ad
ministration has gone against the ex
ecutive council's decismn, he added

Students must sign waiver to release grades

by Kim MacDonald
Until this summer, the college maintalnr

ed a policy of allowing only students ac-‘

cess to their grade reports The only way a
parent could find out how their dependent
child was progressing at Grinnell was it
the student told them. When a student was
dismissed or suspended, this policy in
some cases led to a iew shocked parents
who hadn‘t the slightest idea that their
child had been doing poorly, let alone that
the student had been on academic proba-
tion the previous semester.

Over the summer, however, the college
changed this policy to one which enabled
parents to obtain a copy or their child‘s
grades by writing to the school. In addi-
tion, thecollege began to send out letters in
parents informing them of their child's
probation and possible sispension or
dismissal. Recently studalts received a
letter in their boxes explaining that the col-
lege had decided to change its policy once
again to one which no longer allowed

bation will continue.

All of the discussion stems from a con-
gressional ammendment popularly
known as the Buckley Ammendment,

Among other things, the amendment deals

with the release oi student grades and
transcripts. It was originally intended to
protect students and former students from
prying employers, newspaper reporters
and other strangers who might want to ob
tain copies of a student's records without
their prior consent. The ammendment re-
quires that a student sign a waiver before
copies of his grades and transcripts are
released to anyone This is what students
sign when lilling out applications to col-
leges and graduate schools.

According to Dean oi the Faculty
Catherine Frazer the policy the college
maintained from the ammendment’s
ratification in 1974 until last summer
“seemed to_ serve students." Frazer
described the initial policy as a “consen

parents accgsi to student’sgi'adma The. . .valivie. View”. of. the interpretation of the

policy to inlorm parents in the case of pro-

amrnendinent, while a “good many other
schools hold a blanket policy of sending
grades to parents."

The decision to reinterpret the ammend-
merit rose out of a “real concern from
pawns." according to Frazer. She felt
that the parents who wished access to their
child's grades wished so out of “genuine
and supportive ieelings" for their
children. Thus, the Committee on
Academic Standing decided, according to
Frazer, that "probably parents who are
still footing the bills have a moral right" to
know about their child's progress.

The committee's decision led to the
policy announced this past summer and in
effect last semester which not only allowed
parental access to grade reports but also
initiated a practice oi sending letters to
parents about their child's progress.
Frazer claimed the most notable ﬁling
about the~new policy was the lack or
response. Very few parents wrote to obtain
copies of student grades, though she said

parents wrote and called to say that they
liked the new policy. Frazer heard no stu»

' dent complaints about the policy.

Frazer explained that “an unusual iami»
ly situation" occurred which prompted the
college to back to their lawyer for advice.
He “advised caution”'in interpreting the
ammendment and rrazer said, “just to be
ultr‘acareiul” the college reversed the
summer decision. “We’ backed off." she
said. since the college “did not want to in-
rringe on students." Thus the college
returned to “a more conservative view of

strict interpretation,"

As with most laws and ammendments,
interpretation can vary. Frazer said the
current legal verdict is uncertain so the
college may yet again change policy. For
now students have sole access to their
grades and transcripts, though their
parents will be notified if the student is
placed on academic probation. “We will sit
at this...until the institution's responsibilir
ty is covered," said Frazer. ' '
