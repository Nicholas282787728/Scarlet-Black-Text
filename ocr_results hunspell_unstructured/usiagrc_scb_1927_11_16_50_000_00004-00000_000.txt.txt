"Each Mormon iamilv was given a
’litl'ge city lot, a suburb lot and a
country tract containing twenty or
thirty acres. The hardship of their
first year was particularly bitter. The
second season locusts invaded the
fields, but gulls came and ate the
locusts, and the crops were saved. The
Mormon settlement was layered by the
gold rush oi ms and 1349, ior Salt
Lake City became the haltw. house
from the Mississippi valley to the
Sacramento raliey,” he coi‘llinlled.

“By 1560 the Mormons were ready to
make new settlements. The Mormon
church sent out its surveying parties
ﬁ Each Mormon was given again
three distinct tracts oi land, thus in—
suring each tamily or one good piece
at land. Seldom was a man given
more than iorty acres.

“There is no hetter indication oi the
genius oi Brigham Young than that he
immediately saw the neeessi - oi ii '

» gation. The Mormons are the ii st
AnglerSaxDuS to practice irrigation in
the New World.

I ation Important.

“Complete control or the Mormon
church over the Mormon people was
built in the control or the irrigation
project. The construction at an i in
gation canal was the tirst thing taken
up by a colony. Each member or the
Mormon community took part in the
contribution oi labor to the canal as
to the amount or water he expected to
use on the land he had, The control oi
the distribution or water was under
the Mormon church.

“The church directed the building or
co-operative mills — tanneries, beet
sugar, lumber. Shortly afterwards
immigration laws and funds were es-
mblished by which immigrants might,
secure loans, implements, and seeds
to get started during the iirst year of
the lite in Uta

In speaking or prohibition in Utah
Mr. Mei-k said that Joseph Smith in his
hook forbade wine and strong drinks,
"In this some revelation oi 1833 to-
bacco was prohibited, Since the
World war," he stated, “the voungei-
men came back irom the war cigarette
smokers and have not given up Smokr
ing. Also coiiee and tea lormeriy pr
hihlted are being taken to some extent.

Recognize Poll'giim .

“Polygamy was recognized by,
Joseph Smith in a revelation. Brig
ham Young in 1m started the actual
practice. A Mormon was not allowed
more than one wiie unless he was able
to support more than one and had the
sanction oi the church. The church
said the gates oi heaven were closed
to a woman unprovided formby a hus—
'band. Men who were permitted to
have more than one wiie were to be at
great intelligence and oi very good
health. statistics prove that the chil-
rdren oi these marriage were superior
'to those oi monogamous marriages.
Never more than tour per cent oi the
men were polygamous. Brigham
Young had nineteen wives, forIerour
children, and two million dollars.

‘The Mormon church made every
Mormon pay a tax or tithe oi ten per
-cent. The Mormon came to love the
'lnsiiluiion ior which he had to sacri-
tice."

Missiomn‘ies Work Without Pay.

Missionaries, it was said. were care-
’I‘nlly appointed, hnt worked without
any remuneration whatsoever. Mr.
Mark stated that the church was Inn‘s
‘licularly successiul in wales and in
the Scandinavian countries. and that it
had over 600,000 members in the
United States.

In speaking oi the entrance or Utah
into the Union, Dr. Merk said, "In
1860 Utah was made a territory with

 

practically controlled politics in Utah.
Wherever the assembly tailed to work
with Young he proceeded lo carryout
the law himsell'. Local government.
was a comparative democrary. Each
ci ~ or territory was divided into
n rds with a bishop and town-meet-
ing, These people, predominantly- of
New England stock, brought New Eilgr
laud politics. Disputes were most al»
ways taken to the church courts. and
so here we have a complete complete
church control of economic, social,
and poli \l and religious life,"

This was the second of the two
lectures which Dr. Mel" delivered on
the Mormon church, ts origin and dc-
relopmcnt.
