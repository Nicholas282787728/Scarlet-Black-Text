night for Mt. Vernon. The Grinnell
aggregation spent last night at cedar

Vernon this morning. The entire
student body escorted the team to the
station and under the direction of
"Artie" Gossnrd yelled loud enough to

Saunders Solids Mossrgc

in vain did Gossaid plead with
Coach Saunders to give 8. little talk
before leaving for the Cornell mill
but the best he could do was ohtain
2i written message that was read to
the howling Gl‘lllllelliitns. The coach
said, or rather wrote, “To my mind
there is no doubt as to the outcome
of the game tomorrow. My boys are
going to Mt. Vernon to fight and they
are going to can Cornell.”

therefore, should be a fast and hard

Nature Of The Atom Discussed—
Prof. Rietz Will Speak
At Next Meeting.

Dr. Gcrald L. Wcudt, professor of

chcmistry at the university of Chi—
cago, specialist in the field of radio-
activity and photochemistry, spokc
to the general Science Club, Thursday
night, at 3:00 o'clock, in the lecture
room of Blair Hall. iiis subject was
“The nature of the atom." Dr. Wondt
has been making a tour or various
univers es including Nebraska and
Iowa state College, and has also
spoken hciore various branches of the
American Chemistry Association.
in his lecture on tile atom, Dr.
ivcntlt illustrated his point by (liti—
grains. His lecture dealt in particu-
lar with recent experiments with ra—
dium, and he discussed the formation
of a newly discovered gas, Niton.
This gas is the product of the sub-
traction of helium from radium and
is unstable, breaking down until lead
is finally formed. Helium was con-
sidercd in its relation to photo—cheni—
istiy and medical work.
In comparing recent discovsiics,
with old experiments Dr. Wendti
pointed out that the union of hydro-
gen and oxygen, the most violent
chemical reaction hitherto known fur-
nislied only 200 calories of heat, while
one gram of radium gives off $00,000,-
000 calories of heat as it hccomcs
transformcd into niton, an entirely
different substance with a different
atomical farm.

Dr. Wendi. discussed the possibili.
ties of the atomic system. it may, he

and may be another planct with all
sorts of activities going on upon,

with space, and its extent, as demon—

Enthusiastic Audiance Pleased
by Interpretation of Real
Abraham Lincoln.

Miss Hortense Niel-sen interpreted
John Drinkwater's Kamoils drama,
“Abraham Lincoln,” before a small
but enthusiastic audience at the Con-
gregationztl church last night. Mr.
H. L. Beyer, one of the exponents of
the Drama. League, presented Miss

-Nielsen to Grihnell.

The play was a. brilliant and digni-
ﬁed one that presented the immortal
“Father Abraham," in a way that will
not soon be forgotten, and everyone
who heard Miss Nelsen will agree
with eastern critics that she is one or
the foremost readers in the country
today, A permanent place in Ameri—
cen literature has been achieved by
this play because of the Vivid manner
in which Drinhwatcr has turned back
the pages 01 history and arranged his
material in llnexcellcd artistry. The
play appeals to every American be
cause of its particular signiﬁcance
and higher spiritual appeal occasioned
by our reverence 01 Lincoln.

Miss Nielsen has been making a, tour
of Iowa. colleges and was brought here
unnder the auspices of Calocitgathia
and Institute societies.
