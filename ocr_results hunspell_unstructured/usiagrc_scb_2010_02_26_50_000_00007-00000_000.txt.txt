If you can sing...

1w MARGARET ALLEN

With four different a cappella groups on
campus, drawing distinctions between the
ensembles can sometimes be difﬁcult. Al»
though the groups all sing in the traditional
a cappella slyleithat is, without musical
aecompanimcnt~each has its own stylistic
differences that set it apart from the rest.

The most established of the a cappella
groups, Con Brio, has existed on campus
since the early nineties. The group has de~
veloped a reputation on campus for excels
lence, extending beyond the quality of their
voice to the music that they perform. Con
Brio exclusively performs a cappella music
that is arranged by group members.

Although arranging music can be time
consuming, many members of con Brio
view the group as a musical release. “It’s a
great outlet for students who don’thave time
for Grinnell Singers, but still want to panic
ipate in a group that has reputation for high
level musicianship," Mona Ghadiri ’10 said.
In addition to performing throughout the
year, Con Brio releases an album annually

The smallest of the a eappella groups,
A Cappellicopters, contains eight members
and was created by Rose Kory ’10 in the
Spring of 2009. “I started the A Cappelli—
copters because there were more people who
love to sing on this campus than there were
spots available in the established groups,"
l<ory said. "A cappellicopters is for everyone
who loves to make music.”

Although five of the eight members are
graduating seniors, Kory hopes that a small

group with a similar purpose will take up the
reigns should the group dissolve. “I’d love
for a group with a similar mission to take its
place, even if their name isn’t half as good,"
Kory said.

Noteworthy is another a cappella group
created during the spring semester of 2009.
Although the group is larger than A Cappel-
licopters, Noteworthy also welcomes singers
with any level of musical interest and skill.
“We pride ourselves on being an approach-
able group," Anne Ross '12 said.The group's
open-minded attitude towards what deﬁnes
musical skill extends to its attitude about
performances as well Most recently, the
group preformed at Doug Cutchlns’ house
for his daughters Valentine's Day party.

G Tones, the all-male a cappella group,
is another ensemble with a reputation for
unorthodox performances. “1 wouldn’t say
that we don’t take the group seriously, but
we deﬁnitely approach the music in a less
formal way," Ethan Kenvarg '12 said. ‘We
don’t take ourselves too seriously"

G Tones practices on a regular basis and
continues to ﬁnd ways to keep their music
new and exciting with impromptu perfor—
mances and through the release of their first
album later this spring.

While none of the groups have perfore
mances scheduled for the immediate future,
they all encourage student attendance for
their shows later this spring once dates and
locations are determined.

Sounds great dearling

Friday’s concert brings complex beats, bad dancing etc.

BY MIKE KLEINE

Weird things can happen when you move
atom Minneapolis to New York City. For Dom
Davis, the musical genius behind Darling Phy-
sique, this move meant leaving behind his ex-
perimental rock/weirdo outﬁt, The Trimmed
Hedges, for something slightly more abstract. To
start oii his new project, Davis based the major
ity of his compositions on pure experimentation
and a genuine passion for sound design. Ifany—
thing, Dearling Physique is audio art that actually
sounds like music.The debut album, “Impressions
of the Night EP," features some of the most ,3,
freshing electronic compositions this side of2010
and somehowY it all sounds really familiar, but in a
good way-

Even with a mere four (tracks, “Impressions of
the Night EP" features enough variety and origiv
nality to satisfy a ﬁrstrrime listener's insatiable ape
petite for “good music," Consider these ﬁve adjee
civcs when describing Dearling Physique’s sound:
sinistn, calming, intelligent, refreshing and totally
kicknss.

“Simple You,” the opening track oer the de
but EP is dance music~well, sort of It is a slow
elemorhicbumer that begins with a fairly simple
piano riﬁr but then quickly escalates into one of
those rhytlunically complex-sounding trucks that
somehow taunt you into dancing badly, partially
because the beat is so hard to follow. Moving
past the diestepumping kick and echoed snares,
“Simple You" is just a fun instrumental mack Al-
most 8-bit, but not quite, multiple percussive lay—
ers work with several hi-hat to mask the pervasive
boom bap of the kick/snare drum combination.
Part musique concrete, part pop, “Simple You"
sounds like the sequel to the Knight Rider theme
but also moves beyond it.

Yes, there is a bit of that eighties ﬂavor in
Dearling Physique’s sound, but other tracks like
the EP-eitled “impressions of the Night” and
“Beatis cone" go in a completely diﬂerent direc—
tion to create dais mysterious synth-laden world
reminiscent of MN and Gorillaz.

At ﬁrst, Dearling Physique may sound famils
iar to some and the beats may feel a bit simplistic
but all otthe songs begin this way. It’s as ifDavis
is silently preparing die crowd for whats coming.
Thirryseecnris in and “Impressions Ofthe Night”
adorns its squelches and beeps with layered per
cussions and teverhed vocals. For this type ofmus
sit; it takes a certain person to hilly admire and
enjoy the sonic perfection and tonal quality that
can be found within each tirade

Davis made the soundtrack to your life and
this Friday, you are going to hear it for the ﬁrst
time.
