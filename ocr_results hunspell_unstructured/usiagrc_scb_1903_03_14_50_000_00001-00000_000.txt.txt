THE AFFlRMATll/E. , WHNS

so SAID THE JUDGES LAST NIGHTiGRINNELL DEFEATS CORNELL
1N FINE CONTESTisUCCESS REWARDS EFFORTS OF OUR
DEBATERSAJECISION Two To ONE.

The animal intercollegiate de-
bate was held at the Colonial
Theatre last evening. The ques—
tion discussed was, “Resolved that
courts ofarbitrationsimilartothat
of New South Wales and having
its same essential powers,should be
established in all the leading indus-
trial states or the American
Union." Grinnell afﬁrmed the
proposition and Cornell denied
Grinriell was represented by F. F.
Denison. '03. of Atlantic. w. E,
Paul, '05, of Gilman and G. 0.
Arnold, ’03, of Marcus, Cornell’s
speakers were J. A. Stinson of Red
Oak, W. L. Powers of Sheldon and
A. R. Kent of Mt. Vernon, The
judges of debate were Prof. H. A,
Ross. of the University of
Nebraska, Supt. Finch,of Marion,
and judge Deemer. of the Supreme
Court. DeanGregory. otthe Unis
vet‘sity Law “chool, was chairman
for the evening.

A beautiful evening, a magniﬁr
cent atldience,an ideal auditorium,
college spirit galore, a live ques-
tion, well matched teams, all con-
spired to make the debate an inter
esting and successful affair. While
the audience was gathering. the
followers of Wesley and of Knox
vented their overflowing enthusir
asm by giving their respective
songs and yells. By the time
the orchestra began its opens
rngnurnhers the house was nearly
ﬁlled. Following the orchestra
the college quartet rendered
"A Warrior Bold" and responded
to a vigorous encore with “Nellie
Gray." Dean Giegorythcn arose
and after making the necessary
preliminary statements, called on
Arnold to open the debatc.

He spoke in a clear, quiet way
without gesture or ostentation,
He described the present Condir
tion of capital and labor, organe
ized into two great hostile parties
so that the old relation of master
and man has disappeared and in-
dustrial war between the two
parties has become common.‘This

is disastrous not only to the wel-
fare of the parties concerned, but

 

to society at large. And there
fore the state isjnstiﬁed in intelr
tering to prevent this industrial
warfare. The latest thought and
experience along thisiine is cur
bodied in the New South Wales
law, and therefore its essential
features should be adopted in the
United States.

Mr. Stinson opened for Cornell.
l-lis speech was slow and oracular
and his personality strong. the
weakened somewhat by frequent
reference to his paper. He stated
that the proposed law means state
regulation of industry, and organ-
ization of capital and labor. It
would not work in tile United
States because law must be a
natural growth, evolved out oflhe
life of the people. In order to be
effective it must accord wrth the
political conditions it is designed
to meet. This would not be true
of the New South Wales law in
the United States. The people of
America are opposed to it and
therefore if adopted it would re
main a dead letter.

Denison for Grinnell denied
that public opinion in America is
opposed to compulsory arbitrae
tiorr. The opinion that backed
Roosevelt in the recent coal strike
would ensure the success of the
proposed courts. Present condie
tions are unbearable and some-
thing must be done. Compulsory
arbitration willsettle strikes ale
ready begun, will prevent their
occuring at all, will promote vol-
untary conciliation, insure busi
riess ability, discourage use of in-
junciions, and is the most coit-
servative move that can be made
at the present time.

Powers. oi the negative, devoted
most of his time to proving that a
mininiuinwagewould beinevitnble
and showing the evils inherent
therein, It is iineconomical and
illogical. The court must be sub
ject to political inﬂuences and be»

sides no court can be found
capable of handling the complex
cases sure to arise.
