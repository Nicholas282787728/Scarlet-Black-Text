’Ioo Mucn commendation cannot
be given those members or the t’acultv
who are making such a seriorrs at-
tempt to establish a successful SrrmA
mer Session for Iowa College. Tire
lite ot’ a college professor is not arrl
easy one and after nine months of
hard work it worrld seem only just that
he should spend the srtnrrrrer months in
some kind ot pleasure seeking, But
instead, these nren are willing to give
up one»half of their vacation to re-
main in Grinnell and work for the irr-
terests of the college. We, as students,
certainly should not tarl to appreciate
these strenuous ett'orts and no doubt
nrarry are planning to remain itr Grin-
nell to take advantage of the Summer
Session. There has been a tendency
in the past for those who are some
what behind their class to carry ale
most double work in order to make
up their deﬁciency. Such heavy work
cannot be carried proﬁtably and, too,
one’s whole college life is rrrarred by
atte‘ntptingsttcri a task, By sacriﬁc-
ing a few weeks of summer pleasure
these arrearagzes nray be nrade rip and
at only a slight increase of expense,
Brit this session is not exclusively for
present students. Alumni and teaclrr
ers will ﬁnd it equally advantageous
as a means of retreslring their memo~
ties and calling back the thoughts of
college days, It is sincerely to be
hoped that the attendance will be
large and that the Summer Session
may become a permanent feature of
lowa College.

Recital,

Music was held last Wednesday even-
ing in the chapel and was well attend-
