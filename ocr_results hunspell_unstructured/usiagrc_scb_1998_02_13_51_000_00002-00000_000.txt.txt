Marshalltown who says it's a 1910car

Sogge’s identification closely Ic-

A celebration of the Chinese New
Year Monday, Feb. 2, complete with a
huge paper dragon, helped students at
Fairview Elementary School learn
many aspects of Chinese culture in a
two-week series of activities which
preceded the festival.

During this period, guest speakers
from the community spoke to classes
about China; students studied artifacts
from a Chinese Culture Kit which
traveled from room to room; a collec-
tion ofbooks about China, both ﬁction
and nonﬁction, were read and chil<
dren learned Chinese games.

The also wrote dmgon poems and
stories and many students brought
items from China from their homes to
share with their classmates.

Duane Murray, elementary art
teacher, deSIgned the huge paper hall~
way dragon to which each child con-
tributed.

Other Chinese handcrafts such as
paper cuts, porcelain vases and bright
red Chinese scrolls also lined the hall-
ways.

At the Chinese New Year celebra-
tion, third- -grade students of Martha
StolarikpcrformedaChinese folktale.
A group of Grinnell Middle School
sixth-grade language-ans students of
Tom Dayton gave a presentation
describingthe 12 Chinese zodiac ani»
mals and their connection to the New
Year'scelebration, and Lynn Cavanagh
gave a slide presentation and shared
highlights from her visit to China last
summer.

Fairview students also participated

in three workshops led by their teach-
ers: Chinese cooking including howto
use chopsticks; Chinese calligraphy
and Chinese crafts.

Each student then went home With a
lucky red envelope which sheorhe had
made which contained a genuine Chi-
nese coin provided by Andrew Hseih,
a professor at Grinnell College.

Teachers who planned and carried
out the project were Davtd Abarr,
Cavanagh, Cherill Dayton, Anne Fritz,
Nancy Kuncc, Jennifer O'Halloran,

Hixson winner tells
the value of college

By ANGIE JONES

Post-secondary education is
growing more important in our so—
ciety due to the increase in the
technology world. Computers are
getting more advanced, and they
take more knowledge to operate
them.Newjobs are openinginthese
areas, and higher education is grow-
ing more important with this in«
crease. Any higher education is
valuable, and gives the person a
definite advantage over others. This
is one reason college has always
been a goal ofmine.

College has always been a major
dream to me. I knew that I should
go, but getting there can be difﬁ-
cult. One ofthe biggest obstaclesto
going to college is the cost. Tuition
can be expensive, but there are great
ways to get help. Scholarships and
grants are great ways to help pay,
and they don‘t require you to pay
them hash}. received a Christina
Hixson Opportunity Scholarship
which helped me a great deal. This
award is given to one recipient per
county in Iowa, and awards up to
$2,500. In order to receive this
scholarship, the recipient must be
accepted to Iowa State University.

The Christina Hixson Opportu-

- Posters

- Gonesh Incense

nity award is more than just money.
The scholarship also has seminars
that help the student get better ori-
ented with the university and the
new college life. These seminars
give excellent advice on time man-
agement and stress relievers; they
help to introduce the student to the
faculty and to the many clubs and
organizations at Iowa State. The
seminars are given once a week for
50 minutes and are very worth-
while. They also provide a great
opportunity to meet other Hixson
recipients and meet new friends.

Collegeis anextraordinary place.
It is full of important changes and
learning experiences. A person can
really change and reach so much
potential from any post—secondary
education. Students take on so much
responsibility, yet gain so much
freedom at the same time. I hope
that everyone tries in some way to
better themselves with this educa»
tion.

at Iowa State majoring in animal
science, is a 1 99 7 graduate of Grin-
nell High School. She is the daugh-

ter ofDan and Joan Jones of rural

The food pantry ﬁlled 212 requests
from families during that period,

to any number of reasons, he said,
including winter weather and the holir
