tra will make its 1994-95 de-
but with a piece representing
"a milestone in the development of
this orchestra." according to Jonathan
Knight, who is starting his eleventh
semester as director. The Orchestra
will be playing Tchaikofsky’s“Peter
and the Wolf" for the Parents' Week-
end audience, as well as two other
pieces.

‘This is a tough piece, and our
ability to take this one on, as well as
two other pieces. is a sign of the
orchestra’s strength this year," said

Knight. The piece features different
instruments representing the charac»
ters of this uaditional story. An oboe.
clarinet and ﬂute are featured as the
trio of the duck, cat and bird, respec-
tively. In addition, voices of Peter, the
Grandfather, the Hunters and, of
course, the Wolf are supplied. Nana-
tor Jim Kropa will give the audience
additional guidance through the story.

The orchesua has seen great im-
provement in re/cenl years, and one
positive and integral partof its success
is the orchesuacommiltee, comprised
of eight students who have surpassed
the initial role as simply advising
Knight, and are “actually nlnning
things.“ Pattofacontinuous evolution

over the years, according to Knight,
this year‘scommittoe is“a great group
of gungth students who will actually
take the initiative on projects and see
them through. The committee has
developed intowhatl'vc always hoped
it would be."

Choosing membership on the
committee as a way to make a differ

chesua and orchesttacommittee mem—
ber] eff take notes that the committee
has done many beneficial things for
the group. He cites such activities as
drafting an attendance policy, provid4
ing weekly refreshments for rehears-
als and being instrumental in the“big"
performances of the last two years.

Carminanarla was the brainchildof
Donna Charley, acommitlee member.
and the committee also did a lot of
organizational work for Britten’s War
Requiem. performed last year. Jeff
echoed Knight’s comments, saying
“sincemy firstyear,thecommitteehas
become a lot more autonomous.” He
cites the examples of control over the
budget and the absese of Knight at
weekly meetings.

Member Annie Suzuki also com-
mented on the increasingly positive
nature of the orchestra committee and
the supporting role it plays "the

tended college together at St. Olaf
College in Northﬁeld. Minnesota. In
addition, Allaway had a chance to
work with the Singers last year when
they performed a piece of his music,

encewithhands,orchestrasandchoirs

much like Stuhr»Rommereim‘s be-
cause of their similar backgrounds
and styles. According to Allaway,
“we have a similar technique, we
hear the same things, we have the
same [musical] objectives." Also
adding to the similarity are their
friendshipand Allaway‘s “respect for
John's musicianship and the way he's
built the program". In Allaway's
timespentwith theSingers, they have
impressed him as “avery sharp group"
that “picks things up quickly'ﬁ
