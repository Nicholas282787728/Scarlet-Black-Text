Wanted: Maturity

To the editor,

We have had enough.

There have been too many incir
depts of chIIuction in the dorms
1ately,tirid onlyinnoccntpcoplcnrc
left to pay the damages.

Some supposed “students" go
into other dorms and use or destroy
otherpcoplc'sthings.TheleastIJiat
they do is mess tip the kitchen,
leaving it in a sizitc that no sentient,
semi-clean human being would
want tosetfootinto.Eutmoreoften
they steal the cable from the tele-
vision or the microwave, smash a
computer screen, or break the gloss
lnadorm door. Thescpeople donot
realize that it is the rc5idcnts of the
dorm who willhavctopayihcfincs
and suffer becauseololhcrs’ insen—
sitivity. Often, thccosl is not cheap
rngither.

Once in a while it may be a
townspcrson who docs this dam-
age. This is not what usually hnpr
pcns. More often it is a person or

persons who are either drunk or
stoned, late at night, out to have a
goodtimeventingihcirfrustrations
on something they didn't pay for,
Or maybe it is just a stupid, yes,

would be fun to try something that
could break an item tn that dorm.

or your inability to deal with your
own problems, because of your in
ability to see that breaking or
stealing something will only cause
other people problems?

acting like a first-week first year

Congratulations should go out
to the Grinncll Juggling Club for
bringing Michael Mencs here for a

nice to know that, despite all the
political baloney and gripes over

section ofthe newspaper, a diverse
group olpeoplecan appreciale Mr.
Mcncs' wondcrfuljugglingand not
complain that Grinnell is biased
against this-or»that.

I mean, are you going to be bi-

THE PROGRESSIVE

SIDE

Critiquing conservatism

Noah Rose

I commend Mike Washbum’s
uncannyabilitytomanipulalewortis
andpresent.fonnidtiblerhetoric,bt|t
at times I question his logic. In his
April 5 column, he erroneously
makes the assertion that conserva-
tivepoliticscurtailinstitutionalized
racism. When, in reality, the GDP
has had a deleterious effect on im-
provmg race relations. By disman-
tiing uaditional New Deal phi losor
phy, the GOP has promoted the
[om-union of an underclass. Unre-
mitting cutbacks in education and
social programs not only hinder
economic growth of Cities, but de-
teriorate rural America as well.
Although lack of government
funding damages minorities more
thanwhites,whlteAmericzthns also
felt the burden of Reaganomics.

The GOP docs n0t promote ray

eial harmony like Democrats Such
as Jesse Jackson, but rather uses
political demngogucry to inﬂuence
white opinion

For example, in the midst of
running it “tough on crime" cam-
paign in the was Presidential race,
the Republican party transformed
willie Horton, a black criminal,
intoasymbolofcrimeandviolence
in American society. Democrats
also utilized political propaganda,
but they never resorted to promote
ing racial stereotypes. Although I
believeWashbum is fundamentally
misguided in his political phiioso
phy,Iadmirethathehasihestrength
of character to present a dissenting
opinion on political issues. Al»
though I may disagree with the
opinions that Washbum and the
Grime]! Spectator profess, I feel it

manifested on the other side of the
political spectrum.

Girl Scout gone bad?

Last summer I found a wonder
[ul T-Shirt in 3 Rochester. Minch
sota gift shop I have recently been
wearing it fairly often, and for the
most part. everyone who reads it
smiles, pcrhnps even with a slight
chuckle, liS message is spelled out
in bold yellow letters on a green
background: Girl Scout Gone Bad.
I liked this shirt the first time I saw
it. At the time, I was working at a
Girl Scout Camp in Wisconsin rind
felt lIkC acornpletc rebel. I resented
having to conductflag ceremonies.
despised having to sing a eridir
lional, Christian grace before each
meal and broke the occasional state
lawon Limeoffdalsofoundmysell'
consiantlyfightingiheurgetosiand
up on a table in the dining hall and
shout: “lam ii lesbian! Lesbians are
okay! Ifyou ﬁnd yourseii attracted
to other girls, it‘s okay!"

Conversations with my camp
director and knowledge of our
Council office hiid convinced me

hat coming out even to my fellow
counselors would be unwise, and
coming out to campers would risk
the entire camp‘s existence. Camps
htid been closed down over this
issue when purcnn found oulaboui
lesbian Staff members and refused
to send their Children. Girl Scouts
of the USA had illilcd to take a
stand of any sort in those situations.
So I felt that in the eyes of Girl
Scouting, I had gone bad. By
Society's Slantlnrds, I would be h
horrible role model for the mal-
leable young minds under my di-
rect control for a week or two. And
yet, I began to analyze my position
atcamp. I was a thirty experienced

Alanna Walen

ctirnper, unlike many ormy tciiow
counselors, and I knew the songs
and tradiuons ofihe camp. I wasn‘t
n particularly popular counselor,
probably because I became rather
gruff after the umpteenth hour of
“Whittarcwcdomgncxi,Sagc? Do
I need my swimsuit/cantoen/cxtra
socks?" However, I was a fairly
good counselor in terms of known
ing what was going on and being
rcsponsible for my children, cm-
ploying those patient, positively
reintorcingtcchniques gleaned from
my cd psych class,

I also tend to behave, even here
in the real world. rather like a good
Girl Scout. I pick up litter on the
sidewalk, I take stray dogs to the
police station. I hold doors for the
slow, the chronologically giflC/J,
and in fact Just about anyone who
happens to be passing by. I put
Change in any little cup for charity

next to a cash register. Do my anu-
cstablishmcnt orientations negate
all these “good" qualities. making
me “bad"? I doubt it.

The Girl Scout Law runs as fol-
lows: “I will do my bcst: to be
honest,lobefair,tohelpwhenlum
nccdcd,tobechecrlul,tobefricndly
and considerate, to be a sister to
every Girl Scout, to respect au-
thority. to use resources wisely, to
protect and improve the worlri
around me, to show respect for
myseuandoihersthrough my words
and actions.”

Except for the part about re-
specting authority, this pretty much
describes me, Thcrc may be many
aspectsofGirI Scouting thatlcan’t
agree with, but basically I fulﬁll
this definition of a Girl Scout.
Though I may get nkick out orthe
Shin, I can't really say I've “gone
bad,"Indeed,asaresultofdiinking
for myself rather than blindly fol»
lowing the guidelines orThe Law,
I think I've “gone good."

Unexpected goodwill

My taith in humanity has been
restored. I always wanted to believe
that people were inherently good,
iinti now I can. For spring break I
went to see my parents in SurfCity
via Amtrak. On the wzty back here
IgoiSickand had lobe taken offthe
Lmin somewhere bciwccn Las Vc-
gas and Salt Lake City, I ended up
in a small town called Calientc.
Nevada, and am I gladl

Whether she meant in the state or
the country, I’m not too sure, but it
was pretty small. The people there
were tcmfic and they made me feel
a lot 1ch nervous nghl away. After
a long night and restful day, they
discharged me so I could catch my
train, Well, as will happen, times
got confused and I missed IL

a Wednesday night? To the Hot
Springs motel. The folks there gave
me a room and let me call my par-
ents to pay for it. They even drove
me to the train station the next day.
Idon'tknow whatI would’ve done
if they hadn't been so kind.

Everyone I met there was more
than nice to me. They treated me
like one of the family~all of
lhcmiand I will never iorget their
hospitality. The air was so pure
there it was hard to believe you
were breathing, and the water was
so sweet and clean that it tzsled
bottled.Thcy had natural hot spring
bath: at the motel, too. They told
me about Wild horses in the hills
around the town, but I didn't get a
chance to sce any. I plan on going
back to look for them.

Thanks, Cdliente.
