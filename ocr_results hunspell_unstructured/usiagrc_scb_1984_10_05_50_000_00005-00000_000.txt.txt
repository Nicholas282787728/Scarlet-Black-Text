Fostering pluralism in America: .
Rid schools of nationalism!

by Owen Charles

in this age oi nuclear weapons
and national leaders who retuse to
negotiate. it is all the more imporr
tant that understanding and inter
nationalism be taught in schools
worldwide. Amelioration of world
hostility is the only chance tor the
survival of the earth and its in'
hibitants. Recognition and
understanding or diiierences
among nations and people is
necessary ii we are all to agree to
agree or agree to diiier. but in
either case. it we are to survive

The current situation in
American schools is better than
earlier. regarding nationalism
and ethnocenti‘ism, but still not
acceptable Progress must be
made in multicultural awareness
and pluralism, if we are to pro-
gres away irom discrimination
and chauvinism. and toward
humanism and internationalism,

Presently there is much
evidence at nationalistic doctrine
in our schools, Students lake the
pledge ol allegiance every morn-
ing minaily'sc'tools tthough it is
“not nia ‘lol‘y"t to God and the
country hey are taught to salute
the ting and are taught nae
iionalistic songs and tales irom a
very early age The schools have
had a history oi leaching the ways
or the bible and ot’ prayer and
have signiiicantly reduced this one
ly tively recently.

In add’ 'on to these nationalistic
and religious practices in school.
there has also traditionally been a
locus on the learning oi our oviii
culture and history. and a tenden-
cy to overlook other nations and
peoples indeed history as taught
in our school has had very little
crit icisni oi our own society.

ii any mention oi our country's
mistakes are made. it is usually in
the form at excuses and
apolgetics. not rational criticism.
Indeed. too much attention is
given the "glories" ot’ war: lwo
Jima. DVDay. and the American
Revolution, and little attention is
given to the true horrors of “or:
Hiroshima, the Holocaust. and the
Cold War. How long shall We teach
the glories and heroics beiore we
are compelled to learn the brutalle
ty and suIIering’m indeed it is
time [or a change

From the very beginning oi
their education. our children are
taught about dirty. drunken.
murdering Indians who occupied
our land before we "discovered"
it it took me 17 years to realize
that What 1 was laught was pun:
rubbish. How can we expect
anything more than preyudme and
ignorance from those who have
not learned any better? The need
ior cultural pluralism,
multicultural awareness. and in-
ternationalism is great in our na-
lion’s schools, We need to concen-
trate our teaching eiiorts on
understanding and mutual cone
sideration of others. not ignorance
and blind pride

An atmosphere oi open minds
and hearts can be achieved by
eliminating nationalistic symbols
and indoctrination Iroln our
schools as much as possible and
replacing them with international
symbols 7 study oi the United Nae

tions and its principles. ioreign
languages and cultures, and
human commonality. We must
replace hostility and ignorance oi
other cultures. nations. and
societies. with education and
teaching oi commonality, We
must not reinforce stereotypes
nor teach lies about American ln-
dﬁans. and most of all we must
teach the ability to accept and
understand diiierenees among
people. cultures, and religions
Thus. it is important to teach
multilingualism. or at least bile
ingualism _in America, Aiter
all. the percentage or Spanish—
speaking citizens is steadily in7
creasing to new levels, The impor7
tance oi having citizens who
understand other languages is
also central to ioreign relations
and international business and
communication. The United
States. by most estimates, is far
behind other nations in its
teaching oi and competence in
foreign languages. In Russian. ior
example. many students learn
English in school. however in the
United States. less than 1 percent
of the high schools teach Russian.
and even tewer colleges oiier the
language. In European countries
and many others. there are re
qmrements ioi- multilingual
studies. Thus this Is one area of
improvement for us to strive for
In addition. the awareness of
religious and philosophical diver
sity throughout East and West
should be improved by iurther

curricular change There should
be more emphasis on interna»
tional studies in our public schools
and perhaps less iocus on
American Studies. Children
should not only be adequately
taught the American Revolution.
but also the French. Russmn. and
the Nicaraguan Revolution.

History courses must be more
generously complemented with
courses in current issues The im~
portance or the past should never
be iorgotten. but the immediacy
ol the Iuture should be
understood. also.

Finally. pluralism in all iornis
(political. religious. cultural. etc.t
must be tolerated and taught in
the classroom. Democracy “as we
know it" cannot exist without
pluralism. ior it is tundamentally
based on that concept! We should
strive to eliminate racism and
hatred and hostility. and we can
do that by introducing our
children to dillerent cultures, the
commonality of all humans. and
their own heritage

Only through such changes oi
emphasis and curriculum can vie
iace the problems oi a troubled
and divided planet. Only through

humanism and iiilei‘nationallsm

will we have the guidance to "Do
unto others

Let us eliminate nationalism
and ethnocentricity irom our
children‘s education. so that they
will never bring the world as close
to total anliiliation as we have.

In defense of Harkin

by Todd Peri-y

As an intern ior Congressman
Toni llarkin this past summer. I
developed a deep-scaled respect
tor his polihcs and his stance on
issues which Iace all 01 us
liowever. as a Grinlicll College
student. i understand wtiy some
members or the campus com-
munity here not impressed with
liarkin‘s speech last Thursday

The speech did not involve an in
depth discussion oi any oi the
issues, and (or this reason, 1 .tin
not sure that it was upprnprtaie
tor the mostly proellarkin crowd
vihich gathered to see him in the
South Lounge However, 1 have
some idea as to why the Speeth
took the iorm that it did

Aside from the [act thal llarkili
may have had a bad day dealing
with immoral Minority types. I
think that political observers
should consider iiartiin's speech
in light oi what Harkin is achieu
lng

For ten years, he has suc-
cessiully convinced liis consei»
vatlve Fifth District constituents
that the skills and understanding
oI the issues which he brings to his
job are invaluable to him in
representing Iowa's interests ili
Washington. Because o1 his ability
to take care of his conslllueiils
needs. he has been able to take a
progressive stance on issues
which do not allect his COI’lSll'
tuents on a dayloetl v basis. but
which ultimately aIIt-cl all
Americans

Harkm‘s criticism oi \laslelul
deieiise spending is a good exanr
plc oi his ability to present iihat
has been labeled as it "liberal"
issue to Iowans. and shou them
that he is viorliing in their best in
terest by taking this stance That
this is true is perhaps best il-
lustraied by the tact that issues
originally ol concern to llai’kiii
hZiH: becomc popular issues lor
more conservative members 01
the loud delegation Iowa Se atoi-
cliai-Icso ~sley,astaunch cons
oer ll\'L on most 01 the issues.
has used his iniluentiai position to

tight nastiul deiensc spending,
Like Harkin. he knows that
lovians would iare better with a
smaller federal budget deiicit.
and like iiarkiii. he knows that the
mothers and iathers at young air
lorce pilots do not appreciate the
tact that the pentagon alloiis the
installation oi General Dynamit
Jet engines on r‘ HS which do not
meet the spec‘ tions oi thcsc
aircratt. simply because ocneial
Dynamics has the contract toi
supplying these engines, The
engines do not work on these
planes. and many pilots have died
when the planes have stalled

Nol to get away irom the sub-
ycct. my point is that Harkin has
an amazing ability to develop a
broad political consensus which
transcends political party lines,

Harkin has ideals like everyone
else. but his iirst job is to get
elected so that he can bring the
issues which are important to all
ol us home to the people or iowa.i
know that by and large. Grinnell
College students and iaculty are
not representative oi the people oi
Iowa, But irom the content oi last
Thursday's speech. i can tell that
Harkin is interested in represen-
ting interests that concern us in
Washington. From the tormat oi
Harkln's speech. i can also see
that he is adept at putting these-
issues in a context nhich is accepr
table to the Iowa electorate,

in this era oi radical conser-
vatism. I am thanklul that we
have a senatorial candidate
capable oi taking oiten controvere
siai positions on vital issuies.
vi ithout alienating a large portion
oi the iowa electorate.

Last Thursday, Harkin ilew into
Grinliell alter having spent a day
oi doing jusl that It is no vionder
that his speech was ~very.
politica or "too simplistic" as
some would say.

Assuming Harkin is elected. I
think that we will see a continua
tlon oi his past perlomlance: a
iirm grasp oi the issues and a
deep under tandiiig oi their
political signiticaiicc in ioiia
