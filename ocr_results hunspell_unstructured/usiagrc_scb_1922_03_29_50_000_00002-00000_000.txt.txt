With this issue of THE SCAR-
LET AND BLACK, the staff has
released all the pent up emotions
and ideas that lime been strug»
gling for expression and have re-
verted to type We have at last
succumbed to the lure of modern
journalism (as outlined and de~
ﬁned by critics) and have entered
the ﬁeld of sensationalism.

Too often, it seems, the cardinal
rule of‘ accuracy always” is ale
lowed to extinguish the light and
sparkle of the game. The somber
robe of truth 1s drawn over all the
little glints and ripples that mar
the otherwise placid, sometimes
hude-unl surface and‘ inspiration
languishes. Now. however We
have done away with convention
abolished slavery, and have leaped
forth to play and dance With
Whom and what we may.

Fancy is our guide and the con-
servative path is lost We are
away in quest of new principles
new loves, new witchery.

“Don’t monkey around,” we
can hear some exclaim, “stick to
your proper ﬁeld, and carry on in
the staid and digniﬁed fashion
which has been set by your prede-
cessors,” But it is not often that
we get to wind our intellectual
tails around a limb of the family
tree which so greatly aroused Mr,
Bryan and to us April ﬁrst is a
real opportunity. It is the one
chance that We get to indulge our
epicurean tastes and we have done
our best to serve well the juicy
morsels that have wondered office-
word.

For those who are morbid
enough to desire a closer investi-
gation of the poor old skeleton of
what was once the established col»
lege paper, let us issue warning
that the Scarlet and Black is no
more. THE ANNUAL APRIL
CHRONICLE has replaced it.

The essential
stories submitted for this issue
was that they contain no obvious
truth. Facts, unless adequately

twisted into strange and weird -"

shapes, have been eliminated. All
allusions are carefully masked, to

OFFIBIAL STATEMENI
DEBLAHES EXAMS WILL
BE ABOLISHED AT ﬂNllE

The monthly examinations, scheduled for Thursday end Friday or this
week, will not be held in spite or the petition and strenuous objections c: the
student body, according to a statement made today by N. N. Ennis, keeper of
the Royal Nut Academy. Upon the announcement in the athletic stadium on
\Vm‘d Field Monday morning to the effect that examinations would not be
given Thursday and Friday because of the All-Faculty jack-straw tournament
which is to he held on those days, the student body immediately secured 999
signatures to a petition demanding mat examinations he given as usual

Among those who ieiused to sign the petition were Henriette Naeseth and
William Vogler, who were amid o! dunking. The petition was presented to
the faculty but neither tears nor threats could inﬂuence them to change
their plans. "Nellie" Whitehlll V23 and Williard Armstrong V25 were serious~
1y injured in an atLelnnt to mice their way through the jam in front of the
Dean’s office to persuade the Dean to allow them to take special exams.

In their petition the student body declared hat they would rather have
no vacation than to be deprived of the privilege of taking their examinations.
U, Know “Bee,” chairman of the Crawling Hundred, stated that this ruling of l
the faculty would be carrier] out to the letter.
