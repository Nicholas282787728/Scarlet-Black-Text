A newlywed corpse and the man in black

Corpse Bride (PG

Here's what’s wrong with 7715 Cor/Am 1:: on: it's
too well done. For all ofthe popgoth kids who were
weaned on T/MMg/mnm'eBtfm‘e C/JI'iir‘lImJ, this movie
seemed long overdue, and those kids,myselfinc1udcd,
had nothing but high hopes.

In many ways it met those hopes,with a morbidly
sweet story and settings to match. Boy meets living
girl; boy gets spooked; boy accidentally wakes up the
corpse bride and she takes him to the dead people
town, where skeleton men dance and sing. Now the
boy has to choose between the living girl and the
dead one, with lots of complications and a few spells
throw-n in.

The things that are good about this ﬁlm are the
same tliings_that are good about anyTim Burton film:
a palette of blacks, whites and blues; grotesque char
acters that border on monstrous and Burton's old pal,
Johnny Depp, as the star. All of this works. But Carp”
Bride also seems to borrow from Nighmmn' too often,
The film features a culture clash reminiscent of the
livingedesd dichotomy ofNrgmorr's Halloween and
Christmas town, an awkward yet sweeping romance
and n skeleton dogt .

Tim Burton knows what we see his movies for,
and it’s all here. But by relying too heavily on ad-

vanccs in C61 animation, he almost loses touch with
the other thing that makes him so great: that raw
unpolished strangeness, that patchwork quality, that
makes all the death and decay sccm attractive. Here,
the characters look more human, the settings more
real. A strange plot needs to feel strange, and it feels
too normal here.

Plus, there are few songs in this movie, and Nz'g/ll-
more was an operettn. I realize my bias, but musical
films, especially Burton’s, should go for more instead
ofless. Burton excels in excess.

1 went into this movie looking for Nrgirrnme Be-
fore Chroma: Part Deux. Instead, it tries to improve
upon Mglylmarz', which, frankly, cant be done. But for
any Burton fan, there's plenty ofstrangestasting ey s
candy to be had, and 7714' Coiprc Bride is still worth a
good, long look.

77:: Avinlor was entrancing at times, and Jamie Foxx's
acting in Roy was exceptional.

Whit [he Line follows a specific Hollywood biopic
blueprint, but there really me no surprises in plot and
character here. The Hollywood outline looks some
thing like this: Protagonist his early childhood trauv
ma/abusive or absentee paient(s). Protagonist ﬁnds he
has gift in (music/maid ng money/conquering people).
Although haunted by drug/sex addiction, Protagonist
overcomes this through the power of love/mtisie/
money/conquering people. This archetype is preva-
lent in Wills r/irLine and may be offeputting to some
viewers.

Despite it's predictable plot, Joaquin Phoenix is
an acting powerhouse, ind johnny Cosh is a music
legend. For his part, Pliocniv ﬁnally exorcises himself
from the shadow of his older brother, the immensely
talented and tragic River Phoenix. At times in Walk
[In Line, Phoenix seems to channel the pain he feels
about his brother's death. Apart from his birthmark,
Phoeniv manipulates the audience into believing that
he IS Johnny Cash, which is a sign oft. fantastlc per-
sonal performance.

Any fan of Cash's music should have already seen
this film and should see a repeat viewing us well. Wells
{/20 Line mixes amazing acting with the sounds of
countryerock, summed up by tom bennriinl words:
“Hello, I’m Johnny Cash."
