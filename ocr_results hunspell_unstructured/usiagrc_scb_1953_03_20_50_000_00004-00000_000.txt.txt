This year’s Grinnell Vaudevile.
gians are worthy successors to
the Pete Carltonéhnn Good
group which reigned ior three
years

Since its organization in Or:
tuber, the troupe has played
beiore enthusiastic audiences at
the Elks, Kiwanis Ladies night,’
at an American Legion carni—
val, a Chamber of Commerce
dinner, . the Melbourne. commun-
ity club, andi also for
the l. o o. F. Homecoming din—
her.

The Vaudevilegians are a
professional group: a charge.
is made ior their services, and
the individual memb‘ers are .
paid. Their- local tee, toe in—
astance, is 343. When that is-
divided among seven periorm-

crs, tranmrortation, and other
costs, nobody is going to get
rich. ,

But it’s a beginning. And the
invaluable experience of play~
irig before every type of aud—
ience, of pounding over icy
roads, of giving two different
shows in two different towns in
oneenight. of turning in a good
performance with a splitting
headache, or meeting the breaks
