The Human Element

The rhythmic, rumbling darkness beats
in my ears. The train sways. l hadn't
realized how much trains actually rock.
Kinda like they're toprheavy.

The car is dark, except for the line of
tiny lights embedded in the ceiling, They
illuminate the aisle just enough to be able
to see where you're walking

Sometimes i can hear the hoot oi the
engine — not sharp, just iaint and tar oil
ahead somewhere...there, heard it just
now. Mourniul.

All around me, strangers lie curled up in
mildly uncomiortable positions, seats
reclined. Their cheeks nearly touching, a
young couple behind me sleeps content,
even innocent, their arms thrown about
each other protectively. Across irom them
a withered, pale old woman with wispy
white hair snores lightly. Her chin is
buried in her chest and the breath rasps in
her throat. Reminds me oi a wheezing,
deilated bagpipe expelling its last airs.

Across the aisle a silver and
multicolored toy robot glares at me with
crimson eyes oi plastic and aims its tiny

dangerous laser arm at my iace, probably
centered on my sloping, freckled nose, My
ears are already blackened stumps
(they've stopped smoking now) and I'm
blind in one eye.. or so the robot's con-
troller informs me smugly and in a loud
voice.

He's little Franklin Carl Ackenberry Jr.,
seven years old, Supreme Conqueror and
Ruler of the Universe, served by the
powerful attack droid XR329,,.

And asleep, his lists clamped tightly
around the human-like robot worth about
$6.02 with tax.

His dreams are doubtlessly filled with
raging battles between shiny machines
and bloodied humans. Sizzling bursts of
laser light split the air and lance through
one oi them, hot and crackling Burning
flesh The triumphant survivor plants its
mechanical foot on the chest of the gangly
and unkempt corpse of the vacationing coir
lege student, in the Center of the tattered,
singed sweatshirt (on which GRINNELL)
is stenciled in bright white letters), and
aparlike, beats its chest oi blinking lights.

I look away from the toy, Little Frankie
slumbers on, his mouth gaping.

Ten minutes later, I snap my paperback
closed and slip it into the mesh pouch sewe

1 was really shocked and appalled the
other day. when, during the course oi a
conversation with a guy i know, he said
that this rather “antisocial" girl we know
“deserved” to be “mass-raped.”

in addressing his comment, I would like
to make two points, one about rape in par-
ticular and one about torture (does anyone
want to argue that rape is not a form of tar»
ture'!) in general, As for his rationalization
oi her “deserving" to be raped, it seemed
to me very much to be a case of his
perceiving her as seeing herseli as very
sexually attractive but being unwilling to
have sex (or even talk) with certain guys
because he thinks she thinks she is too
good for them. in such a situation, she supv
posedly “deserves" to be raped because
she is, by her mere presence, exciting
men whom she will not satisfy. (Could it
even be that he has swallowed the
dangerous myth that the media sustains
when it portrays a woman, torced to par-
ticipate in some sexual activity, liking it
after all?!’?! No woman enjoys rape )

The second part of this first argument
deals with my use of the “he thinks she
thinks” phrase. That construction ilr
iustrates just what a male supremacist
attitude people like this guy have;
everything in their chauvinistic world is to

‘ be interpreted in light oi what men see as
appropriate behavior ior women, When
women deviate from these male establishr
ed norms (which themselves are internal-
ly inconsistent), they “get what they
deserve" as determined by men,

On a larger scale (as lithe personal tore
ment oi one woman is not enough), rape is
torture Mass rape has been used by arr
mies in the subjugation and containment

of a people and is even an accepted method
by some oi these groups. Some American
troops in Viet Nam (even though our ar-
my, in writing, prohibits such activity)
mass raped and killed women 7 some in-
nocent young girls were mass raped in
front of their families when found hiding
from troops, other women were sexually
tortured in attempts to elicit confessions,
These incidenm involved both a male
supremacist attitude and a racial
supremacist attitude. (What does this
have to do with anything?) These attitudu
and other supremacist ideologies like
them justify ior many men the rape or
women just as diey justiiy other means oi
torture for other people who “won't stay in
their place” (or conform (are we talking
about the oppression oi homosexuals
now???) doesn’t denying someone their
civil rights approach torture?)

Until we can accept all groups as outline
ed in our Constitution, (this is the place to
which people flee to escape all the shit.
remember?) we can't begin to fight tore
ture (in all its subtle forms) in general and
rape in particular. what is really sick to
me is that the media and comments like
the one this guy made constantly reiniorce
such supremacist ideologies and make it
next to impossible for the effects of these
perverse beliefs to be reversed or averted,

With head tilted back, I look up.

Two buttons. Both white, I press one.

Oops.

A bright beam. Full in his face, I flick it
off almost immediately, but not soon
enough

”Wha...” Justin exclaims, startled, His
wide eyes search wildly ior their attacker
tor a moment, then slowly begin to shut un-
til they're barely open. “What time is it?
Are we there yet?" The lids quiver, and
then snap shut. “Did we pass..." and his
words drop oil, becoming unintelligible.

“Sorry,” I say apologetically.

He doesn’t hear me; he’s already asleep

Standing, 1 tap my button lightly,
casting the area around me in darkness.

I saunter back from the bathroom
situated at the end of the car a few minutes
later, careful not to be taken unawares by
a sudden jerk of the train. Ican see myself
losing my balance, stumbling, and ialling
on top or a sleeping stranger, with my
luck, a hairy man, one with a big gut and
large hands to wrap around my scrawny
neck.

I gain my seat without incident and once
more plop down heavily in its padded ems
brace. Justin stirs, but does not awaken.
The entire car is dark, its passengers all at
rest. Calm, A peaceful atmosphere settles

in the car.

Hoot Tiny lights oi a town ilash by. The
serenity oi the night envelopes the striding
engine and its docile followers,

I ieel incredibly iatigued, but am still
unable to sleep, “C’mon.” i tell my mind,
“Relax.”

The thrumming, driving train wheels
murmur, “Sleep. sleep.

Hoot. Sad and stant.

My watch blinks at me. A blurry 3'30
a.m. “You're on break, sleep'” my body
commands.

“Sleep ..”

“I can't!" [desperately want to answer,
but my tongue is thick and my head grows
heavy.

“Sleep..."

The gentle rolling irom side to side lures
me away and out into the starfilled night. .

Blessed silence, thick fog of dreams ~
both reach to embrace me in their sweet
peace, Deep, indrawn breath. Blackness.

“Waaaa! " The wailing is throaty, pierc-
ing, and l jerk awake,..again.

The squalling baby.

lilick the reading light on, and open my
book.

rar ahead, the iiery engine lunges on
through the starry night toward North
Carolina.

First Cardinal ' .

Wait, Placing the heavy wool scarf into
my duiile bag, l heard the distinctive un-
chained melody ring through the air. After
months of heavy silence there was no
doubting it. l heard it again. The first car-
dinal called out triumphantly, “I am here.

Where is my mate?”

We had opened the patio doors to let in
the cool March air. The curtains billowed
and allowed the Scent of thawed earth to
envelop the room. In the effort to Verify the
sound, 1 tripped over the tire iron we had
placed near the bed to protect us. On my
side lay the clothes iron I had opted to use
like David against a Missourian Goliath.

The sound was not anticipated. Each en-
suing spring the iirst cardinal seems to
mock my frozen stare downwards at the
treacherous pavement. Grey snow still
covers the ground and the trees hint only
slightly ot their hidden potential. And
when I hear it, shocked, neck muscles
strain as I stare up at the highest limb
where they will alight.

At the patio doors i looked upwards,
searching ior the first cardinal. The sky
was clear and the reflection of his vibrant,
red feathers flashed back at my winter
worn eyes. Proudly displaying his crown,
he was as cocky as his predecessors. The
roar of an airplane overhead drowned his
second song.

The potential weapons we had cautiously

Relays. . .

The Relays XIV Committee, being the
decisive group of people that we are, has
finally chosen the official t-shirt designs
for the upcoming event. But it wasn’t
easy!

Due to the overwhelming response oi
high quality designs, we've decided to
print two types oi trshirts: one with a
design submitted by Brian l-Iinkle, and the
other with a design by Susan wise. Brian
and Susan will each receive a teshirt with
their respective designs and split the $25
prize In addition, a third deSign will be use
ed ior Relays publicity purposes Stacy
chger will receive $10 ior this design.

The Relays Committee wishes to thank
all those who took the time to create and
submit their work.

placed near the had only seemed ap-
propriate in a motel room oiiering three
separate locks for a patio door. Nearby,
extending its cement parameters for
miles, the St. Louis airport and the sur-
rounding neighborhood oifered few arenas
in which the first cardinal could display his
wealth. But he seemed content, continuing
a cycle. End ilows into beginning, Unenr
cumbered, he swooped through the air and
disappeared into the blue,

Growing up with a crazed ornithologisti
could appreciate the first cardinal. We live
ed in the Northwest where, throughout the
year, birds, forests, and meadows blended
into grey. Occasionally, weighted down
with binoculars and pursued by a trail of
seed, she would spot the flash of yellow
upon a goldiinch. After citing the creature,
she ran around frantically, filling her
feeders and baths and adding a goldfinch
to her list of newly spotted birds of the
season.

But my lriend and I were in the Midwest
where the winter seems endless and even a
lone cardinal may elicit a similar
response. Loaded down with luggage, we
passed through parking gates, electronic
doors, and the great beeping portal, The
wings of the airport spread out ior miles so
we hopped on the horizontal escalator,
pushing and pulling us to our destination.
Mechanized airilight, separation. Airports
will make my stomach churn. Spring may
come again.

disappeared. into the blue again.
