That may be about to change.

setting up the Burling server, ex-
plained that he sees the Web as a tool
for exploiting the tremendous aca-
demie resource that the Internet rep-
resents. ”The World Wide Web is
the tool of choice for using the
Internet rrght now,",Engel said,
“It is the most sophisticated tool
available,” The planned Burling
server will include the ability to
search the Burling catalog, but
its main feature will be its links
to specific academic resources
available elsewhere on the Web.
For example. the server might
include a llrrk to an archive ofall
the State of the Union speeches
up from FDR through Clinton or
access to the Internet home of the
Fedcral Reserve Board so that
economic stttdents and faculty
can get information on interest

B ASEBALL opened the

1995 season on

Wednesday, For the
first time since August of last
year, there were major league
games. The 1994 season was
interrupted by a strike which
caused the cancellation of the
World Series forthe first time in
many decades,

Although the players have
returned, no one seems to care.
It used to bedifftcultto gettick—
cts for opening day in most ma-
jor league cities as fans flocked
to stadiums to catch a glimpse
oftheir favorite teams starting a
new season. This season. there
were only a handrul of sell»outs
foroperllng day. and nrostleams
played in half-empty ballparks.
Team owners hope the fans will
come back, but no one is really
sure if and when they will, It
seems that baseball fans are hav—
ing a hard time forgiving and
forgetting.

lfrnd fan resentment a little
puzzling. Fans are upset be.
cause of the greed of players
and owners caused the cancellar
tion of baseball for the last two
months of the season in 1994,
They'reupset because theWorld

 

Current

Series was canceled.

It's new 1995. Although
the season started a little late,
the players are back, and the
teams are playing again. The
players have pledged not to
strike and the owners have
pledged to not lock the players
out. Unless something crazy
happens, the 1995 season won’t
end until one team emerges as
World Series champion. Why
are fans reacting to the loss of,
baseball by ignoring its return?

In 1994, fans went on with
their lives without baseball. In
1995, baseball may have to go
on without its regular fan base.
Regardless of how many people
are in the stands, Matt Williams
will still hit mammoth home
runs. Gregg Maddux will still
dominate National League hit-
ters. Frank Thomas will still
attempt to get a triple crown.
Some fans will miss out. That's
their loss.

My beloved Chicago Cubs
are 2-0 right now. If they can
keep winning (and that‘s a big,
no make that a colossal “if"),
the Cubs might make the play
offs. N0 grudge will keep me
from cheering for Mark Grace
to hltzfaslballinto the Wrigley
Field‘s bleachers come October.

room, Ellen says that “(what we need
is faculty participaLion at this point."

Ellen, while she may feel alone
here in her ofﬁce on this campus, is
part of a growing trend in campuses
across the nation as well as a growing
political feeling. "There's a whole
political feeling as well that supports
and wants to capitalize on the idealism
and the energy of college age stu»
dents," said Eilert. “Many institutions
of higher learning are paying a lot of
attentton to thrs."

“It’s a big tnterest and a large
percentage of students go into social
services after graduation," she said.

Ellen recalls one theory oflearn»
ing which states that by reading some
thing aperson learns , hearing helps to
team it a little better, and doing it ts the
best way to team it. “lntemships are
the best form we have new of doing
that," she said,
