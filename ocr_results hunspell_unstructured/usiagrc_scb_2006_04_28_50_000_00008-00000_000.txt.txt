Grinnell firemen:
an environmental
catastrophe?

Lorin Ditzler ’06
Mounting the [cruel

Ah, the annual Grinnell Fireman’s Ball. Casual
dressers always welcome. Casual donations even more
welcome. Nothing could keep me away.

1 plan my outfit a week in adwrnce. With my posh
firetrrucktred gown and caution-rape»yellow boots I
am suie to catch the eye of at least one or two eligible
ﬁremen.

Finally, it's time. I head off to the ball full of vie

-sions of sweaty, smokeecovercd men dancing ﬂaw-
less fox trots and elegant, yer masculine ranges, Lost
in such pleas-mg thoughts, I hardly notice the small
group of brightly dressed college students at the Ball
entrance.

It is not until the shouting begins that I even real-
iic who they are.

I should have known they would come. Avid pro~
testors can never resist a public event of such a large
scale. From a distance, the yellow, orange and red clad
mass looks almost like a ball offire. For the firefight
ers, they are exactly that: an unruly hall of fire that_
must be extinguished

Barring my entrance to the ball of my dreams' is
none other than SAHSOTO: Students Against Her
gemonic systems of Thermodynamic oppression.
Flame-shaped signs reading “Free the Fire"wavc in the
air as students try to shout their way into the Ball.

Suddenly, a megaphoned voice rises above the rest
forcefully addressing the confused bystanders. We,
the students of SAHSOTO believe in the natural
thermodynamic tendencies of heat and fire, and in
their right to a fair existence, free of verbal and physi-
cal haiassment, overt discrimination and rampant ext
termination. We know that . .."

Resolutely,l make my way toward the protesters.
Those hippie fire buggers have crushed my dreams for
the last time.

“ .. In its natural state, the prairies oflowa burn as
part of the cycle oflite, death and rebirth. Fire is an
implement of change in society. Those who stiﬂe it,
stiﬂe the development ofhumanity .

i can see the horrid megaphone bobbing above the
crowd. I disappear among the protestors, easily blend-
ing into the bright, fiery mass.

“ .. and the natural order. As socially conscious
members of this community, we can not tolerate any
celebration of the agents of this societal stagnation
and injustice. This ball is a disgrace to all who value
the planet and her natural systems. We demand r"

The entire crowd stands transﬁxed as the mega-
phone sails through the .ur, finally smashing against
the unforgiving sidewalk. The speaker is dumbfounde
ed. Poor sap never even saw me coming.

. “What do you think you're doing?" the enraged
megaphone hog demands ofmc.

“Let me into the ball or else I‘ll 7"

"Or else you’ll what?" The voices begin to roar

In a nation where corporate executives receive fat bonuses
for securing billions of dollars in government tar breaks each
year, it is a colossal embarrassment that 14 million children
from poor and working class families go hungry every night
because their parents cant afford to feed them.

The bill before the Senate to gradually raise the minimum
wage to $7.25 over the next two years is necessary, but even it
alone is not enough

Without an increase in nearly a decade, the current minis
iiiuni wage stands at 26 percent less than it was in 1979 once
adjusted for inﬂation Since then, poverty has doubled among
full time year round workers

Increasi g the minimum wage to $725 will make a $4,370
per year diiierence to full-time minimum wage earners, 35
percent ofwhnln arc the sol earners {or their families. It will
directly benefit at least 5 tnillion workers.

For' a family of threc t at eould mean river one or orgro-
ctric over nine months of rent, a year and a half oi heat and
elect v, or full tuition for a community college degree.

An overwhelming majority of Americ ,—so percent—
have the good sense to acknouledge that 85 1: an htPiur' is too
low. And sup-
port for r
ing the mini
mum wage has
been growing,
even in the
least likely of
places.

As of Oct
tober, at least
17 state gov-

c r n me n t s ,

which are oft

ten even more

busine friendly than the federal government, already have
their own laws a place making the minimum wage higher
than the federal require-
menl‘,

A recent Pew Ree
search poll found that,
despite conventional
arguments against a pa
raise for the poorest workers, nearly half of all small husin
owners now understand the need for it.

Empirically, the oldvhat argument that minimum wage in-
creases eausc economic catastrophes isjust wrong. In the four
years after the last increase, the economy grew faster than it
had in over 30 years creating 11 million additional jobs.

Furthermore when so many workers cannot earn a living
wage, the t' payers end up picking up the tab through various
social services and r tance programs

Even to the most unreasonable of fiscal conservatives, the
prospect of getting that many people off costly government
assistant programs must seem pretty appealing. SEmploycrs
shouldnt have the right to pay their employees too little to
live.

Employers Shouldn’t have [lie
rig/ll {0 pay their employees too
little to live.

Since the last minimum wage increase in 1997, members of

Congress have increased their own salaries by 331,600. Held
up to any reasonable standard of f rn _ clear that our
record on the minimum wage is an‘ jus ce.

The truth' is, the“ in "' ble hand" is far too invisible to the
37 million Amer' ans llVln‘ 'n poverty today. Its again time
to do something a little more. concrete.

I The Congress-should raise the
I minimum wage to $7.25 an hour.

Tell Senators Ted Kennedy (DeMA) and Hillary Clinton (De
NY) to stop interfering With our nation’s economy! Americans
should oppose the bill in the senate that would increase the federal
minimum wage to $7.25 in three steps because of the detrimental
affects it will have on our nation.

First, it should be noted that minimum wages should be deter
mined at the state level (in fact, all blit seven states have their own
minimum wage).

According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the highs
est of the two minimum wage amounts will be used. Eighteen
states and the District of Columbia have signiﬁcantly higher
amounts; of the 25 states that share the $5.15 amount, most are
considering raising this amount

The federal government cannot accurately set a universal minie
mum wage because the cost of living is different in each of the
states; only state legislatures can accurately forecast the economic
impacts ofsuoh minimum wage changes in their respective states.
In other words, on: size does not fit all.

Second, let’s clear up some misunderstandings. Poverty is a
byproduct, not ofa low federal minimum wage, but ofunemploy-
mentl Furthermore, all the analysis about low wage earners reﬂects

accurately only
for your hame
burger-flip-
ping jobs.

So let’s
forget about
the image
or the single
mother work
ing a full—time
m i n i m u m -
wage job and
think about
the 16-year—

old working at McDonald’s. Does he deserve a pay raise for his
excellent deep frying skills?

Third, let's look at some economic theories about minimum
wages. By raising the cost oflabor, you eliminate jobs.

In 1996, Jim Sexton of the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress estimated that the raise in minimum wage would cost
our country between 100,000 and 625,000 jobs, most of which
were entry level That mcrcase was only t. 90 An increase that
is well over 32 will undoubtedly wreak much more havoc on our
nationsjobsl

This increase in unemployment will lead to an increase in
poverty and the growing need for welfare, as thousands will now
consume government assistance. People already on welfare will
remain on weLfare longer, adding to consumption of government
assistance.

All this consumption of government assistance will increase
governmental costs and eventually comes back in an envelope to
the taxpayers

Furthermore, you decrease the incentive for people to get more
training as well as induce higher numbers ofhigh school dropouts.
Investment in the most important resource, human capital, will
rake a huge hit as firms sufrer the burden of the higher costs of
labor.

Clearly, the actions of Congress would do much more harm
than good; economic growth would be impeded and lots ofpeople
will lose their jobs. if there are to be any changes to minimum
wages (or, more appropriately, living wages, which is a different dee
hate), these changes should come from state legislatures that have
a vested interest in monitoring the affects on their economy.

Give blood, people need It

Dear Friend,

Please consider signing up for the blood donation.
instead of thoughtlessly dismissing the student vols
uiitecrs trying to sign you up for putting your fragile

150 lb frame at a grave health risk, just suck it up.

and sacriﬁce a whopping 45 minutes ofyour time. In
40 years when your lazy butt will be put on six dif
ferent prescription drugs, nobody is going to ask you
for it. rm AB+ which makes me a universal recipi—
ent and pretty much worthless to hospitals You’re 0-.
You had bio, go figure. When my blood gets tossed
away after expiring yet again, yours probably will have
found a nice home to move around in and keep warm
for a little bit longer. A life.

Hope to see you out there this afternoon,

Enviuusly,

5&8 unleashes sword of Truth

Just before I go to bed on Fridaynights, I lay the
6'ij out on my bed with the editorial facing the
heavens. With tightly clenched fists l fervently pray
that the Truth you have unleashed upon the world will
strike down the legions of mi_ ided, ill-informed,
dirty hippy storm troopers who have the audacity to
disagree with what you have written.

Although I try to refrain from judgment and re—
spect the ignorant as I commune with the heavens on
your buhalﬁl can’t help but become infuriated at how
little the enemy knows about “discourse." Don’t they
realize that discourse in iLs truest form is you speale
ing and them listening? Don't they understand that
you wield your prose like a sword ofTrtith, stugically
seeking out all that disagree with you and skillfully
removing the cancerous portions of their thought?
