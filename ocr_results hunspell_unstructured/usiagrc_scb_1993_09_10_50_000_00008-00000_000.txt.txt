Mt. Vernon Meet Gives
Women's X—Country a Good
Look at Season's Potential

FTER finishing second at lhe Mt. Vernon Invitational las
Saturday, Coach Evelyn Freeman proclaimed that the mec
gave her a clear indication of her team's potential. “Overall

the meet helped us in many ways. It was a good barometer to see how
we stack up against competition, it was a chance to race in a low-key
event without high anxiety, and it helped us see where we are in terms
of conditioning," commented the coach.

Wartburg, two-time regional champion which has placed in the
nation‘s top ten the last two seasons, won the meet with 17 points. The
Pioneers tallied 47 while Loras was third with 94.

Freeman continued, “I had a feeling we were going to have a fine
learn. but after Saturday it looks like the potential is definitely there.
What shocked inc most was the significant improvement some of our
runners showed in onlya week’s time. Additionally. our times this fall
were better dian last year's."

Rookie Stephanie Walters made a strong showmg in her debut by
finishing fourth, covering the lerlmlt‘, course in 12:36. Sophomore
Stephanie Hitztalcr was seventh in 12:42 while another rookie, Katie
McBride, clocked a 12:50 for 10th place. Ally Beckman came in 12th
with a 12:59 and Marta Fisher rounded out the scoring, placing 14th in
13:03. Holly Pfitsch placed 16th in 13:04 and Susana Peinado came in
18th with 313:09.

“Only 33 seconds separated our top seven runners. If that is the
norm throughout the season, we should have a good year," noted
Freeman.

Three otherPionccrs had strong showings. Jessica Henry finished
20th, Jen Jacobson was 2lst and Amy Harris placed 23rd, The coach
was especially pleased Will'l Harris’ performance because shc is coming
offa year-long injury.

This week the harricrs will run to Rock Creek State Park. Freeman
is planning a tough week oftraining, hoping the sqlllid's conditioning
will come along.

“Our athletes are very excited after the race at Cornell. llhink they
