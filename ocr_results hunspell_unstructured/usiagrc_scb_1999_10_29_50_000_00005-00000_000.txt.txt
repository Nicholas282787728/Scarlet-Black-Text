The Creature Resurfaces

By Sarah heinhard
Staff Writer

Five years of gradual develop—
menr and hard workwill culminare
in rwo weeks in a new 80-page edir
rion ofrhe CIA/1mm,

The only publiearion at
Grinnell devored solely to music
and enrerrainmenr, the Creature
started small in 1994 as a srapled
packer ofarnclcs, reviews, and oc-
casional inrerviews produced
rhrough KDIC.

since chen, rhe Creamy! has
grown consistently under Kurt
oizeck's ’99 edirorship, despire fre.
quent ﬁnancial barrles.

“I decided I really wanred ro
make it inro somerhing," said
Orzcck, who rook over as ediror
during the fall or his sophomore
year.

At that rime, he was operaring
wirhin a $500 KDIC budgcr, earn.
ing a minimal salary orszoo, and
snuggling ro expand his compurer
skills.

“The only pagemaker and
Photoshop I knew was from my
experience as Arrs Ediror for rhe
sacs,” nored Olzeck.

He also described rhe frusriarion
of working wirh old, unreliable
compurers in rhe publicarious
building

Despire rhese serbacks, Otzcck’s
devorion to producing a good
magazine remained srrong.

Fueled by a longstanding ene
rhusiasm Fordrawmg. painring, and
music, he saw rhe crooner as an

outlet for sclﬁcxprcssion as well as
a source ofinformation.

“I basically realized that I could
translate my art onto a computer
and mass-produce it," said Orzeck.

Orzeck also identiﬁed 1997 as
a year “when 1(ch sraricd shap-
ing up" and Widespread interest in
campus bands made a publicarion
like rhe Creamer in high demand.

By his Junior year, Orzeck had
secured funding rhrough SPARC
radier than KDIC, and was look-
ing forward ro producing mree solid
issues before the fall semester endedr

However, ro compensare for
lack of finances, SPARC withdrew
funding from the Crmmre just be»
fore rhe prinring otrhe rhird issue.

“SPARCJust ﬂat out ran out of
money," said current SPARC head
Jon Pctltt ’01, “and this caused the
previous SPARC heads ro em out
cenain rhings, one ofwhich was rhe
Ciel/1mm”

Upser by rhe sudden wirhdrawal
offunds and determined not to let
a semester of work go to waste,
Orzcck printed the issue anyway
and left SPARC to work out ﬁe
nances.

During the spring of1998,
Otzeck studied abroad in Chile,
rurning over rlie edirorship ro
Vivian Curtis ’01. He also secured
a special granr from Presidenr
Osgood to covet budget costs

Meanwhile, Pctitt was busy en.
suring die Crt/tmre a place in furure

“Some SPARC groups did nor ger
