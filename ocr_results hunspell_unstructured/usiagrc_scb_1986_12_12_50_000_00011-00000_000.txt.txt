Off-campus Nets IM Victory

Paying Attention, Santa?

by John H. Moore and Ju§tin Lincoln

The impending renovation of Ann has
spawned passionate concern over the
future oi the College's social environment.
Perhaps the tirst step in constructing a
suitable atmosphere ior largerscale
leisurely activities such as movies. can»

certs, and all-campus parties should in».

volve attention to more intimate social set-
tings. AS an example. we propose the erec-
tion of Trivial Pursuit Hall. a center for the
nurture of romantic relationships, involve
mg every aspect of the game.

The Sport and Leisure Wing would give
couples the opportunity to play head
games. as well as tongue twisters, among
other contact sports. Tickle lights and
thumb-wrestling would. of course. go hand
in hand.

Students oi Geography will delight in
following the Love Boat around the
Pacific. learning the coordinates for every
Lovers Lane in the world. and taking daily
trips to various Erogenous Zones.

History buffs will trace the evolution of
love. analyze the love lives of prominent
personalities, and discuss the ramifica-
tions of the many hearts lost on the hate
tlefield of love.

In Literary terms. students will read

Don Juan's 1001EXCUSES FOR A DEAD
RELATIONSHIP, learn from Paul Mc-
Cartney how to write silly love songs. and
critique the famous “Dear John... ” Let;
ters of the Second World War

The World of Entertainment will reveal
the secrets of THE LOVE CONNECTION,
the therapeutic value oi soap operas: and
why Phil Collins allegedly does the trick
(is it the rhythm?).

Finally. Science and Nature Wing will
leave singles green with envy, Students
will be able to plant kisses. sow wild oats.
describe the bonding that occurs during
courtship. and employ techniques oi
positive reinforcement.

The structure of the Hall would include
sleeping quarters upon request. thereby
creating a side beneiit ior single room-
mates oi attached persons. They never
again need to withstand annoying giggles
and coos. nor do they need to tear uncomr
iortable sofas However. such facilities
would be occupied on a first come. first
serve basis only

By iirst serving the needs oi such simple
intimate relationships. the administration
will be better equipped to iuliill the
demands of the much more complex situa-
tions involving more people, ,

 

Swim Teams to Pool
Efforts Against Division II

The women's swim team‘s 107799 loss to

coach Martha Ruwedder reason to smile.
Friday'sscore was the closest Grinnell has
come to Coe in recent years. and Rowedr

ﬂier believes the meet could have been won
had Grinnell been able to utilize its iull
depth.

Depth was indeed crucial as the near vvin
was gained with only one Grinnell victory.
that coming from Colleen Murphy in the
diving competition. In addition, Rowedder
applauded the eiiorts oi sophomore Katy
Furnish. who tinished 2nd in the 50 and the

loo. and AnneiBradley. who scored not one _

ly in the 50 and IUD. but also in the 1000
Free. an event in which she had no prior
experience.

According to Rowedder. Bradley's Situa»
tion was commonplace as several adjust-
ments were made in the line-up to compene
sate ior temporary absences. as well as
the losses of diver Cathy Trout and
breaststroker Dorothy Shearn. who will be
studying abroad next semester. “Our
depth is what's going to get us through the
season well.” said Rowedder.
