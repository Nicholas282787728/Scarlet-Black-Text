SCHOLARS PARADISE
\Vhat looks to us like a scholar’ paradise, has
been established at Harvard llllll’el'sltymwitll the
acceptance of zl plan long advocated by A. Law-
rence Lowell, retiring president of the school.

President Lowell’s plan calls for the organiza--

tion of a Society of Fellows, composed of college
graduates who will work for no degrees or other
academic honors, but who will be picked for their
promise of contribution to knowledge and thought.

Twentyrfollr iuen lllwe been appointed foi-
three your terms and will be known as “junior
prize fellows", with a yearly salary of from $1250
to $1500 each. free bozlrd and room, and free use
of university facilities.

The 24 men, appointed by a special board, will
devote “their whole tilllc to productive scholar-
ship, and preparation therefor, free from acadelllio
regulations or degrees.”

Such a step, we bt‘lievc, is well taken. The
plan will enable outstanding students to curry Dll
independent study and creative work—the latter
being of more importance than more research work
—nnd if only one of the 24 develops something
which is all aid. or new (ICYClOpll'Ielll', ill his clloSCll
field, the plan will not be a failure.

KINETOGRAPHIC PEDAGOGUES

Recently, the automatic grade recording 111er
clliuc was introduced.

Now, Dr. Ernest Sccmall of Duke university
proposes robot fllclllty lllelllllel'sitllilt is, tulkics
which would show lcctur ' and demonstrations by
leading cductltors, and whlch might be distributed
ill such a way that lilrgc numbers of students
would be enabled to hear and sec them,

These “kinctographic pcdagogucs”, the tech-
nical name applied to them by Dr. Seemzlll, would
be usecl particularly among the llllenlployctl“lf his
plan were carried out.

But, what tl score it would be for the Techno
erotic contention that human labor is being rapidly
replaced by machine labor—4f sllcll “canned” lec»
turcs were used generally ill ollr leading educa-
tional institutions!

chlvell for id! We may be old fashioned and
ignorant, but it seems to us that ill tilllcsl to these,
the installation of new labor saving devices is
hardly a help toward getting us “around tllc cor-
ner” to normalcy.

Steps have even been taken toward the clinl~
ination of the hard working stcllographer, Bl

RADIO DANCERS
(Dally Illini)

We've often wondered just why radio parties for
groups on the campus have not been as prevalent this
year as might be expected. Radio parties are one means
of entertainment that might well be worked in during
the depression to aid the house budgets that are sinking
a little below par. Naturally the effervescenoe of youth
so apparent on the campus according to the movies and
similar organs of publicity, must have some outlet. It is
a little too severe to expect everything social to be
dropped when there is actually no need for that.

The main idea this year in the face of quite a few local
creditors demanding or requesting payment in part on
past hills due is to economize where possible, and in this
way ‘to make ‘it easy to pay at least part of the debts
owed by the house. If orchestra dances are out of the
question there is hardly a house that does not have at
least one radio. It is easily arranged to pick out good
dance music programs, and the static conditions being
good the evening should he a success.

This idea might work in many cases where more
than one dance is planned by an organization for a se-
mester. it is advisable to cut down as much as possible
in order t omeet outstanding obligations in those houses
that have them, and a radio dance or party might be one
means of saving money toward this end. The party need
not be dead on account of the fact that there is no on
chestra. Several houses tried the plan last year and a
few have used it this year. Orchestras add quite a hit
of pep to a dance when it is possible to have them, but
the radio idea certainly wouldn't be out of place in keep-
ing the Wellrknown wolf from the portals.

THIS WOULD BE HEAVEN
(Oklahoma Daily)

The landscape was luminous this morning, and the
student walked buoyantly, as though he had trouble
staying on the ground.

“1 want to take four hours of English, three of gov-
ernment, five of French and five of sociology," he told
his adviser. _

“Fine," said the adviser, and marked the slip oken.

The student blinked twice, and the adviser repeated
his remark, adding, “Glad to see you taking such diverse
subjects. I was afraid you might want to specialize."

It was a bigger sun shining outside, and he had uev-
er seen 'so many laughing people on Enrollment day. He
went to the registrars office and put down the slip.
"Fine,” said the registrar. “No fees."

“I won't have to specialize to get a degree, then?”

“011, no. You just go four years and take what you
Want."

The student said nothing for a moment, then gulped,
and whispered, “What kind of a place is this anyhow?
What are the required subjects?”

“There are none," the registrar said, and smiled
genially.

The student reeled slightly.

, And when he walked outside he gasped. He'd never
seen gold streets and people wearing wings before.
