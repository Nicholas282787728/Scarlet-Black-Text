Alcohol

"om p, 1 Coordinator Jen Jacobson '95 said that one

recommendation might be to introduce more
educational programming into some ofrhc college's oricntm
tron activities. “Right now, 1 don't know that we have a large
component in our New Student orientation about alcohol,"
jaeobsen said. “And it seems unsate tor students to learn
through trial and error"

Member otthe Task Force, Assistant Director ofRosie
deuce Life and Looschead RLC Kim Hindsalirush reiterated
general support for the current policy by saying that a shift
toward a dry campus could potentially lead to more problems
with alcohol abuse. "People will still drink, they'll just do it
behind closed doors, and not ask for help when they need it,"
Hinds-Brush said. “This way it's out in the open and I don't
worry so much about someone drinking alone in their room
and passing out and nobody noticing or calling for help."

The policy review comes at a time ofincrcasetl concern
over the use ofalcolrol on camprrs, with 11 rrlcoholerelated
hospitalizations reported to Student Affairs last semester.
Osgood said that he had been contacted by both students
and faculty concerned with problems related to alcohol. “1
might say that it’s the frrst time ever in my time here I’ve
had students contact me to complain about alcoholerelated
behavior. In 11 years, I’ve never heard anything rrntrl this
fall."he said.

However, discussing Grinnell's alcohol culture wrll not
be limited to numbers oflrospi ntions but wrll also lrkely
include information from conversations wrth students.

editor for the 5371?), as well as student staff member Dodge
Crccnlcy ’11 and SGA President Neo Moi‘ake ’09 will sit
on the committeeThc meetrngs will also be open to other
students.

“It will be a good opportunity for students to rake part
in things that are happenrng on campus, especially with
something as huge as the alcohol task force,"Morakc said.
“This is a good way for [students] to actively take part in
decisionemaking.”

According to us. Department oflsducation's website,
under the Drug Free Schools and communities Act, any
institution of highei education that receives “ﬁnancial as-
sistance under any federal program must Certify that it has
adopted and implemented a program to prean[ the unlawful
possessron, use, or distribution ofillicit drugs and alcohol by
students and employees."

According to Dougharty, previous reviews were conducta
ed entirely within Student Affairs, with comparatively little
input from students, faculty or other administrators, "[The
Department of Education] suggest using a Corninuniryrwldc
approach, of getting all the stakeholders involved in looking
at what the issues are,"he said. "Because drug-{rte schools
has not only to do with places to study but also as a place of
employment.”

Also, have you over finished a paper 10 minutes be
