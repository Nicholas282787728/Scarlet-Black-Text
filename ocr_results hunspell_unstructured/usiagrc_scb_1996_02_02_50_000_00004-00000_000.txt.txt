Dear Todd,

Awhile backI promised to write
to you about the lack of erotica veti»
clotslti orinnell. Don’tgetme wrong
ﬁ there are the usual assortment of
magazines with pictures of half na«
ked, naked, and extremely lewd nat
ked people sold in at least one local
store, Still, 1 have yet to see any
erotica here.

Thedictionarydefinitionoferot—
ica is much the same as the dictio»
nary clelinition of pornography, but
the connotations make a clear dis
tinction between them. Both words
are Classical in origin, but one has its
roots in the writing on brothel walls,
and the other signifies a connection
to Eros. Today. “erotica" is often
seen as a term describing a bland,
highbrow, costly sort of pornogra—
phy, but even this view cities not
exclude the idea that the word erot«
ica generally connotes art,

What is art? People have been
arguing that question for centuries,
and may continue to do so until the
last sutvivmg human stops talking to
him», her-, or itself. On a more
practical level, most people define
an the some way the ,udge oetinecl
pornography: “I know it when I see
it." From this viewpoint both are
highly subj ective. If someone doesn't
see the art in a work, it‘s not art for
that person, and ifsomeone doesn't
see the prurient interest in a work,
it’s not erotica or pornography for
that person Once, beguiled by a
misleading cover, I ended up watch-
ing a Video featuring thirty minutes
of boot licking. For me, that Video
was not art, erotica. or even porn ‘
it was a simple waste of time and
money.

How much are reproductions of Art

Panther

Panther is a passionate account
of the formation of the Black Fan—
ther Party, a militant black activist
group, during the 1960s H|sloncal
characters (Huey Newton and Bob»
by Seale) mesh with o fictional nor.
rator, Judge (played by Kadeem Hart
dison), to create a ﬁlm that is some
where between fact and fiction, Dr—
rectorMatio Van Peebles produces a
powerful exploration into the issue
of race, mixing action with a more
intense pol iticnl statement,

Clue

Clue brings together a talented
ensemble cast to teenact the classic
mystery board game, Starring Tim
Curry as the butler, the cast ofchart
actors are brought to life by such
comic actors as Martin Mull, Chris—
topher Lloyd, and Madeline Kahn.
It’s astylish spoof of whodunit thrillr
ets. Prone to indulge in slapstick and
general silliness. Clue manages to
maintain a comically frantic pace up
to the minobencling conclusions.
Just don’t bother to try to solve the
murder using any kind of deductive
reasoning.

Muriel’s wedding

Asone ofthe growing numbetof
smart comedies coming out of Aus—
ttalin, Muriel's Weddingis the tale of
the town outcast who finally comes

However, we noticed a huge cliscrep.

At one point in the moVie a charac»

The running themes of this mov-
ie (death, fishing, and old people
haying sex) were the best part The
subplot with Darryl Hannah and her
beau (they were trying to get married
despite their grumpyold fathers’ con»
tinuedinrerventionsandctaftyplans)
was less than interesting. And the
general plot, the old men‘s romantic
lives, was just okay.

Sitting in the mom theater, we
were often forced to ask ourselves,
“Why is this funny? We don‘t want
to think about old people having
sex." But maybe that’s precisely why
it is so funny, . .

This movie (according to Kate)
was better than the first, whose only
redeeming value was the lull of old
people's breathing around her. But
then they fell asleep, too. Perhaps
she was too young when she saw
