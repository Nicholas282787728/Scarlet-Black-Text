TEACH: Program encourages involvement

for America in exchange for a ‘

two-year teaching commitment
from the student. After the
eight weeks, the graduate is
placed in an area that needs
teachers. This way, students
who do not have certiﬁcation in
teaching can explore the
possibilities in the teaching
field while relieving the
problems due to a major lack of
teachers across America.

"It's America’s future to
teach", explained Laura
Johnson, co-coordinalor of
Grjnuell's Teach for America

Day. “The program is not in
left field,” volunteered Chris
Gunst, the other coordinator.
He continued, ”It will work."
Gunst’s conﬁdence is due in
part to his experience at a
convention given by Teach for
America. Both he and Johnson
were ﬂown to New Jersey by
the organization to attend the
convention, They spoke with
other college students and
became very excited about the
implieaLions of the program,
Johnson and Gunst are quick
to clarify that although Teach

for America is sponsoring Teach
for America Day, thcy are two
different things, The day will
allow students to actually
interact with the children, but
the program itself requires
admission through an
application process and emails
the eight week course if a
student is accepted. Recruiters
for Teach for America will be
on campus March 8, but
participation in Teach for
America Day is strictly
voluntary.

anything, the students did
accomplish something: “We’

lots of ways [to help others] and ‘

Becky Lansky, a sophomore.
