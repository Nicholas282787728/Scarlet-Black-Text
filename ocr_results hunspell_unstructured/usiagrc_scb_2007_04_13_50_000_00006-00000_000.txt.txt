Senior recital season begins

BY ANAND BALASUERAHMANVAN

Chelsea Levcnthal '07 elaborately lines
the strings ota piano with foam, screws, eras-
crs and other household objects to alter the
sound produced by each key. She then digitally
manipulates her recorded melody to create an
entirely new sound. For her, this unorthodox
spiiit is one of the most exciting aspects of
electronic music. “My parents mer in 1 rock
hand,” she said,“so l have little background in
classical composition."

Levenrhal is one ofsix seniors giving hour-
long music iecitals within the next few weeks.
These performances are not mandatory for
Music majors or exclusively for tllcmiﬂutist
Nick Moulton 071s a French major, and me

Chemistry majoribut as noted by Grinnells
Music department chair, Eugene Gaub, obvi—
ously the performer has to be pietry advanced
and dedicated in order to assemble an hour's
worth of music ready to present in public.”

Gaub said that senior recitals are often
the result of a 400*levcl music class or MAP,
although any student can choose to do one.
Unlike Levcnthal, most of the performers do
not compose the pieces they perform, instead
choosing pieces by other students or profes»
sional composers. Recitals can take many dif-
ferent forms. “The most cxistcntially fraught is
the solo piano recital, in which an unaccomp11
nied pianist plays for an hour," said Gaub. But
a student may choose to perform with a group
in a “‘Yo Yo Ma and Friends’ format, which
may intersperse collaborative music-making
with solos."

The three pieces Leventhal composed for
her recit1l on April 19 are dark and emotional.
In one piece, layers of pitchrbcnt gongs are
slowly played in reverse while disranr bowed
vibraphones and fire alarms rise in volume,

providing a satisfying crescendo. Her sheet
music has also been modiﬁed so that the notes
and staffs are distorted to reﬂect the electronic
modulation. She admits that this might sound
a little bizarre at first. “It’s easy to feel illegiti—
mate since I can’t sing and don’t play an instru-
ment," she said. “Instead I go home and swish
pots and pans in the bathtub."

Leventhal is still hard at work in lhc_dark
and spacious electronic music laboratory in
Bucksbaum, animating 1 video to accompany
one of her pieces. She is attempting to line up

music. The fact that she is the only electronic
performer amongst many more conventional
instruments doesn't faze her. “I think things
are changing and all this," she said swinging
her arm across an array of computers and vidr
eo editing equipment, is becoming more no
ccpted Even her grandfather told her that he
listens to her recordings to fall asleep.
Levcnthal has been accepted by the presti-
gious electronic music program, the European
course for Musical composition and Teclr
nologics,1nd will study and create electronic
music next year in several European countries.

Stories and nonconformities

Student- curated American works and reconstructed Russian apartment are on View at Faulconer Gallery

av LAWRENCE SuMuLoNc

Walking away from one of Andy Warhols works of art
tucked unassumingly in the corner ofFaulconer Gallery's ex1
hibit on contemporary art, S/m'ei and Hiitari'er, I decide to

_ leave America for a moment and step into the other featured
exhibition: T17: Space ‘Zf Freedom: ﬂpartment Exﬁil'itimlr in
Leningrad. 19641198151 feel the temperate atmosphere in—
side the recreated late Sovietrera style apartment and qui—
etly admire the paintings, prints and drawings that encircle
moThe works ofart enliven and color the walls, which seem
to sulk and sag from the tired aondcscriptncss of their own
wallpaper. The apartment is a frozen hulk of Soviet sllppretr
sion, thawing in 1 Grinnell art gallery and uplifted by rhe
cornucopia of non-conformist artwork that circulates the
room. Alone in the room, imagining it crowded with curi—
ous citizens and aesthctcs, I feel like the
first person who rediscovered the ruins of
Machu Picchu. .

Open until April 22, Gnnnell Col-
lege’s Faulconer Gallery is currently
showcasing l’wo visually striking but cul-
turally disparate exhibitions. “This is a
case where the two shows are very much
a study of contrasts," said Faulconer Gals
lery director and curator Lesley Wright. “One is in 1 little
enclosed space, the other is in a big open space. One is about
art that had to be underground, and the other is about art that
is in the mainstream ..A lot of the work...is done exactly at
the same time. But coming out of two different cultures, [the
two exhibits] have a very different feel.”

TI): Spare szl'eedom, a traveling exhibit organized by the
University olechmond Museums in Virginia, reassemblcs 1
soviet apartment, circa 1970, trafﬁcked with paintings con
tributed by the Museum ofNonconforn-list Art in St. Peters
burg, Russia. Reworking the classic notion of an 1rt salon,
the apartment represents the homegrown art exhibitions that
nonrstatcsancrioncd Russian artists would hold in secret.

The second exhibit, Starlet mid Hindi-£21, has an entire-
ly different feel than the intimate and furtive enclosure of

TIM Spats o/Fmiiooi. The pieces in 3min and Histaltn are
presented conﬁdently 1n the open arena of a contemporary
art gallery. The exhibit showcases artists from various social
backgrounds, embarking on a WaltWhitmanian artistic projr
cct in its endeavor to depict what Wright called “the messy
tapestry" that is America.

“Our idea was to choose works that told a story, either a
personal, social, or political story, and how that contributed to
a greater portrait ofAmerica in the later part ofthe 20th cena
airy,” said Fauleoncr Gallery intern Julia McHugh ’07, who
co—eurated the exhibit. “We wanted to choose pieces that we
thought the college community didn’t really know that we
had. Also, we wanted to show our recent acquisition of the
Kara Walker series. 1 think it is deﬁnitely showing the college
community that we own 1 lot of really great works.”

ForMcHugh,wlloseﬁrstexpcrience
. curating an exhibit involved searching
through the college's art collection in
the basement of Bucksbaum, doing ex-
tensive research on the artists and phys-
ically moving the pieces, the creation of
Sigrid: and Hixtal‘ltl was both an act of
discovery and an act ofartistry. “l was
prerry overwhelmed and surprised by
the pieces that we actually had," she said. “I think the part
that I didn't know really happened was that you physically
carry the paintings around and put them against the wall and
step back and say “Does that look good there? Does that look
good with the other paintings?”

As a result ofsuch careful construction, the paintings and
the individual exhibits seem to communicate with each other
in an indirect and understated fashio . The exhibitions invite
its audience to interpret. “I think its rbc job ofthc curnror to
put together a show that makes connections between works
that you might not even know you’re making, but visually
you're connecting things on some level," said Wright. “The
exhibitions workas a space as well as a series ofobjccls on the
wall...you’re thinking and feeling three—dimensional.”
