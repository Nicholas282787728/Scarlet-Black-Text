Squad in Saturday's
Home Cinder Dual

By Jack Wile.

Glihnell’s elitile flack squad
will be elltelecl ill Satur’days
meet hele with Iowa State
Teacllels College,

G. Lester Duke, track coach.
said yesterday that no admission
will be charged for the meet, The
starting time is 2 p. m.

Jenkins “in Run

Headed by a strong representa-
tion in the field events, the Pie—
neers will have a good chance to
avenge last year’s loss to the
Panthers in the Iowa State Teacha
ers relays.

The Cedar Falls thinclads will
be represented in the mile and
probably the half-mile race by one
of the outstanding distance men
in the middlewest, Bill Jenkins.
He placed third in the two-mile
race at the Drake relays last
year with a time of approximate-
ly 9:30. Besides being a good
distance man, Jenkins has come
to be known by most of his oppo-
nents as a particularly colorful
runner. His eccentric conduct on
the track is well worth coming
out to see,

Walters Holds Record

The Pioneers will be featuring
some outstanding men, too. Ed-
ward Walters and Harry Barker
are opposing each other ‘in the
javelin throw, Walters holds the
record for that event in the Iowa
state Teachers relays, but B - er
has proven his throwing ability
by taking me discus-throwing
championship of the Missouri Val-
ley conference in his sophomore
year. George Finck, Grinnell
man, will oppose Bob Keyes, state
Teachers, in the broad jump.
Finck defeated Keyes last year
in me meet at Napervilie.

Grinnell’s 440 yard relay team
should make a very tough apps»
nent for the Teachers boys. Paul
Patterson, who placed second in
the quarter for the Pioneers in the
Drake dual last month, is running
in number three position on the
team and is a man to watch next
