Editorial
Distributional
requirements: no

Soon, the subject of distributional requirements will move
to the forefront of campus discussion At issue will be
whether or not the school will institute a 12 credit divisional
distribution requirement.

The concept of distributional requirements stems from the
old, ”well-rounded” and common experience aspects of a
”proper liberal arts education.”

WHETHER THIS conception is appropriate for the
twentieth century is being hotly debated on college cam-
puses all over America. The issue is complex, and in the end
is usually a matter of personal prejudice.

But the issue at hand for the Grinnell community concerns
one particular proposal: that every student should have a
minimum of 12 credits in each of the college’s three major
divisions.

THIS PROPOSAL should be rejected for a number of
reasons. First, the way Grinnell divides the departments into
divisons makes the proposal meaningless. Sociology does not
belong in the same division as Philosophy or Religious
Studies. And placing math in the science division has always
amazed certain purists.

Twelve credits in each division says nothing about
diversity; it merely reﬂects an arbitrary decision made some
years ago,

ALSO, THE LOWEST level courses offered by many of
the deparments do not offer a meaningful introduction into
that discipline. While a course may cover the issues address-
ed by a discipline, the course often avoids the methodology
essential in that area. Such a course could often be dup-
licated by reading the appropriate section ofiTime magazine

The current proposal simply does not work. Although the
debate about requirements should continue, this proposal
must be rejected by the Grinnell community for the simple
reason that it does not do what it is designed to do

BECAUSE OF THE way the Grinnell departments are
divisiondlized, the proposal guarantees no breadth of
education. Even if the departments were grouped in a more
logical manner, the presence of watered-down, lower level
courses would cripple the plan’s objective

There isronly one way to assure what the plan’s sponsors’
want: a core curriculumiwhich is something that (at least
for the moment) few favorl But certainly if the current plan
is approved, its failure will lead to increased cries for such a
change. That move should be headed-off, now.

FINALLY,THERE IS one other reason for opposing the
policy To borrow from Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman‘s idea that rules (as in the CSL-approved
bathroom policy) which could potentially keep capable
students away from Grinnell should be rejected; this policy
stands no chance.

STUDENTS CHOOSE a college for academic reasons,
Many of Grinnell‘s current students chose the college
because of its lack of requirements; it‘s safe to assume that
future students would have the same concern.

And, as Tederman says, the college wouldn’t want to
discourage qualified candidates, would it now? .

Letters to the editor

Attacks MOBE’s “liberal naivete”.

To the editor: The efforts of the
Grinnell MDBE (described in a
handout distributed to the Campus
this week) are another example of
the presumption and infinite
naivete displayed by American
liberals.

The reality of the world is that
nation-states will seek arms to
maintain their national security,
however they perceive that
security.

While it is a desirable and
necessary goal to seek limitations
of the arms race, it is useless to do
so in the manner of the 60’s style
protest. The choice oia nation in its
decision to buy arms or develop
weapons is not made on the basis of
what who protesters are doing in
Chicago. '

The choice to purchase arms is
made on the basis of domestic
politics within nations and as a
result of foreign relations between
nations. it is at this level of reality
where meaningful discussions of
arms limitations, such as SALT,
occur.

A group of protesters in Chicago
who wave signs at‘ national
representatives does not make for
meaningful negotiation or
productive dialogue on arms

Defends Peterson,
chastizee 58B

To the editor: We call upon me
58:8 to justify the printing of.
the letter to the editor by Ray
Warner, which we found to be
unwarranted, rather immature,

and quite venomous. Everyone is '

aware of the problems of the
basketball team these past two
seasons as the 5&8 has seen fit to

publicize it. Why print such a letter l

when the season is nearly finished,
Roger Warner is not playing this
semester, and Mr, Warner’s 01>
jectivity can be doubted in this
matter?

limitations American liberals who
engage in such protests do not
seem to understand this. Their
wellrintentioned concern is
misplaced and results in wasted
time, effort, and money.

It is easy for these people to
protest against arms purchases
from the position of relative
security which exists for citizens of
the US, But these protesters fail to
consider the viewpoint of an in-
dividual or government in an in-
secure or unstable Third World
country.

Thus, for MOBE members to do
what they “felt was best for
everyone” was ethnocentric, self-
righteous, and presumptuous.

They were certainly not
representing my interess nor were

they representing the interest of
those who did participate in the
conference.

i am in favor ot a peaceful world
and of a world free of armed
conflict. But, let us seek these
goals through meaningful Chan»

nels, not Via the onesided and
useless protest of a minority of
well-intentioned, but misguided
activists.

it is also irresponsible to claim
that Mona managed to keep so
participants away, I am more
convinced that the weather or
other circumstances kept them
away and not the efforts of a group
of protesters. Carolyn Miller

To the editor: i am writing in
reference to an article concerning
Miller Brewing Company’s claim
that Anheuser-Busch adds a
chemical additive, tannic acid, to
its beer instead of natural
material.

The truth is, tannins occur
naturally in many foods such as
grapes, nuts, Lea, and cereal
grains. Tannic acid (used in
chillprool'ing beer) is a natural
material,

_in fact, the tannin settles out of
f the beer. during this process and is

Governor Reagan is not afraid to
stand by What he believes is right
and tell people those beliefs. Is this
dangerous? If so. then! hope more
politicians are as dangerous. I am
tired of politicians playing the
middle of the road failing to let the
electorate know where they stand.

Mr. Edwards must be afraid of
the‘NeW Rightism. such as Reagan,
shaking up the Republican party
and ridding it of the ”say nothing”,
“do nothing”, and “politics as
usual” officeholders within the
party. If ml: is the case, then I
hope gentlemen of as high esteem
as Ronald Reagan endanger the
party more so in the years to come.

Tannins also occur naturally in
the grains and hops used to brew
all beers. Thus the tests conducted
by Miller would naturally indicate
measurable quantities of tannin
materials in all beers. The tannin
materials measured in Anheuser—
Busch beers include the com-
ponents derived from hops and
grains.

In conclusion the Miller com-
plaint is misleading and tends to
confuse people. Donald Retrich
