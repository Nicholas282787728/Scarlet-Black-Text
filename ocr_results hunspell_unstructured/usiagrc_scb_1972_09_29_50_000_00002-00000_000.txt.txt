Jacobs leaves

by Michelle Casey

Mr. Robert Jacobs, resident ad-
viser tor Homes and James Halls
and twoonrcampus houses,comesto
Grinnell College irom the business
world at New York city, Mr. Jacobs
grew up on Long island, and grade
uated trorn Tufts University in 1967
with a BA in Political SCience. He
)olned the Army reservesattel‘col»
legs, and then worked ioriouryears
at the.| central oilice oi theJ.C Pens
ney Co. as a buyer

Although he liked the business
world, Bob did not like What he
saw himseli becoming in it, so he
decided to leave and go to grade
uate school, He received his MA
in student personneladministration
at Columbia University, last June.

Bob chose Grinnell basically her
cause he wanted to work at a Small,
coed, private college Willi intelli-
gent students. His earlyimpressions
lndlcate that Grinnell has livedupto
his expectations.

As for his position as resident ads
viser, Bob ieels it is really lmr
portant to try to detine his role.
”Asl go along, I delineit more and
more,” he said. He ieels it's res
dundant to declare that an RA is
someone who has gone through the
experiences oi College as the slur
dents, who is older and more mar
ture, as other RA's have said this
previously, but he also has these
ieellugs.

Bob thinks that his basic persons
ality is such that students can trust
him and (eel comfortable talking to
him. “The job is good in the sense

ISPIRG Hearings

Discuss Discrimination, Public Regulation

by Curt Gorrell

Racial discrimination, sex dis-
criminalion, and prison reiorm
made up the agenda for the ISPIRG
public hearing held at the university
of Northern Iowa on Thursday, Sep-
tember 21.

“white supremacy is out the wins
dow...st£lrt dealing with people as
human beingsand L‘qllals," said I'Iugh
Gibson, who began the hearing
speaking betore a predominantly
White student audience He felt that
the key to blackrwhlte relations is
to “accept what's part OI their
(black) culture and life style oniln
equal basis with your own “

Equatlng the terms “Social" and
”Cultural”, Jim Porter agreed Willi
Gibson’s point. lte questioned "Why
is it, as wealthy as we are Slips
posed to be as a country, why do
we have hunger ,.so many people
poor; so many proless to Chris-
tianity, then why so many that hate7
The answer is not to hate."

Discrimination in attitudes \tns a
major local point in a discussion
oi sexism led by a leiiiihist deles
gation iroin Ames. iii the course
oi the aiternoon hearings, women
were described as bearing a double
burden: that or misconceptions at
themselves, coupled nith the miss
Conceptions of others about them,
as manifested in sexism and sex
discrimination,

The evening hearings on prison
reiorm brought out tlnumtierolpOSr
sible areas for ISPIRG research

projects. Judge Leo Oxberger spoke
about the inequities involved in the
assessment oi bail. Also, in l'eferr

“Public regulated Industries”
were discussed at the next lSPlRG
public hearing at the University oi
lowa hold on Monday, Testimony
was given by both regulatorsandthe
regulated, and by concerned repre—
sentatives irom organizations and
agencies outside the regulated util-
ity structure Each witness spoke
not only or his perception oi the
problems in his particular iield ot
expertise, but also suggested sper
ciiic ureas and projects ior rer
search by lSPIRG.

A wide range oi issues were laid
out beiore a panel oi students irom
Coe, Cornell, Crinnell, and the Un-
iversity oi lowa “There’s almost
no limit to research areas in util-
ity regulation,” said Maui-ice Van
hostrand, Chairman oi the lawn
Commerce Commission.

The necessity ior rate increases
was an important question raised
ior debate throughout the hearing.
Dwight Swanson, President oi lowa
Power and Light, was critical oithe
lowa Comm ce Commission's reg-
ulating poli es, saying that "the
Commission is looking at the past”
but Jack MacAllister, Vice Presir
dent and General Manager ior Nore
thwestern Bell Telephone, tell that
“the low Commerce Commission,
in terms oi representing the pub-
lic, has done an outstanding job
..,we have had ample opportunity to
present our case,"

A concern ior the environment
prompted many questions, Swanson,
speaking about the energyci‘isls and
electrical utilities’ resource needs,
was asked what method might be
used to tap the vast coal resources
in lowa. “It’s likely that strip min-
ing would be used,.." he said, but

Black Studies:

by Svliva Wallace

Gl‘innell has recently instituted an
interdisciplinary Black Studies ma-
jor. This major consists of [our
core courses (Intro to Afro-Amerir
can th, AirorAmerlcan History 1
and II, and Black Studies Senior
Seminar) and one elective dealing
vlllll the black experience In ad-
dition, 16 credits are required in
one of six designated areas of Con-
celltl‘dtioll Sociology, Anthropo-
logy, Political science, English,
History. or Economics,

This iiiaior is designed especially

he felt that the land Could be rEr
stored after the coal was removed.

MacAllister Viewed corporate reA
Sponsibility in a context at commit-
ment to a community, in addition to
the strictly environmental aspects
involved. “I argue that reasonable
contributions (money, people, ideas)
to the society...that the corporate
citizen serves are every bit as im-
portant to thecommunltyasthetele-
phone servicewegive.” Macanister
felt that such contributionsbecduse
they areservlces, should helnolutled
in the rate charges. Van Nostrand
thought dilierently: “They shouldbe
able to donate to Charities, but not
to pass costs along in their rate
Charges,"

”ISPIRG should Call for lobbyist
disclosure.,,l‘or legislation require
ing that all lobbyists disclose how
much they are paid and by whom,"
proposed Ed Mezvinsky, Democratic
candidate ior Congress, In addi—
tion, he advised: ”What you have
to dc to move an institution that
isn't moving is expose.,.problems.
By bringing them out into the open
.,.they’ll have to deal With them."
According to Mezvlnsky the key to
this is arousing public interest,
which in turn willarouselegislators
to respond.

This theme was also presented by
Mike Sellars, Chairman 0! the State
Department DIPublic Safety. “I think
tile and death is the iirst priority,
and (the need ior) highway saiety is
the first threat,” ISPIRG research
could be of value in this field,
stated Sellars, because “there’s no
place where a little bit oi energy
can have Such great enacts as in
highway safety."

A wide range oi iurther topics
were touched upon during the hears
ing. Herb Anderson from the State
insurance Department declared a
need ior research on no—iault ins
surance as ll relates to Iowa. "Too
much reliance on what needs to be
done in lowa has been put upon what
has been done in Massachusetts,
Florida, Delaware...”.

“We’d like a new statute on anti-
trust, The only thing provided for
now is price fixing; otherantiscom-

peutive methods (such as economic
,cuercion) are no Covered," said

Bennett Cullison of the Iowa Attor-
ney Generals Office. Cullision felt
that ISPIRG cooperation with his
oiilce in certain Cases could be
“very useiul.”

In addition to presenting testimony
and outlining speciiic areas ior
ISPIRG projects, most witnesses
also offered encouragement and
stated a willingness to work with
the ﬂedgling public interest group.
Mezvinsky noted that “Ralph
(Nader) really got started in this
state.,.when he testified in Iowa on
auto safety in l965 ..that's when the
consumer movement really came
alive. I’m a strong believer in what
lSPlRG is doing...the great hope we
have in this Country will come from
this type oi group,”

Viable Moior

ior students who are interested in
locusing their academic attention on
the Black Experience and at the
same time specializing in a coin
cidental discipline. students are
also strongly encouraged by the
department to take iull advantage oi

Here’s hoping that more GrinnelI

students will become aware oi the

most noteworthy interdisciplinary
