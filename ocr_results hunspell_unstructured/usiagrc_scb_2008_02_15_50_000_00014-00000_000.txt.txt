New Head Funeral! Cour}: Max Hawsey. AMl FREEBERG

Football team
welcomes head
coach Hawsey

Work ethic and enthusiasm produce

great expectations from new coach

BYJAI GARG

After less than a year ofsearching, Giinnell has hired Mat
Hawsey to be the new head football coach. The vacancy was
created when former head football coach orzo years Greg Wal-
lace took over as athletic director. The decision to hire Hawsey
came after .1 nationwide search that culminated with four pro-
spective coaches coming to campus.

Hawsey has already begun coaching at Grinnell as the use
sistant track and field coach,

“We want to make our football program as strong as it can
be," said Athletic Director Greg Wallace. “We have a very good
group of committed student athletes, and With his guidance
they can be very successful over the next few years."

Hawsey has never been a college head football coach before,
but he has been involved in coaching college football for the
last 10 years. He first served six years as the assistant football
coach and head track and ﬁeld coach at his alma mater Austin
College and then moved on to become the offensive coordinate
tor of Colorado College. At Colorado, Hawsey helped the of
tense break 15 school records. the offenses averaged 30 points
and 400 yards per game over the last two seasons.

But will the past success be transferred over to the Pioe
nests?

After going 1,9 last season, many fans and spectators alike
would be pleased if the team reached .500 this upcoming sea-
son, but Hawsey has greater aspirations. “I expect to win the
Midwest Conference Championsliip,"said Hawsey.

Hawsey backs up his assertion with a strong work ethic.
“He is one of the first guys that comes to the building every
morning," said VVallacer “Isle is one of the last ones to leave."
His strong work ethic has also caught on with the players,with
many players participating in voluntary off-season workouts,

." The workouts tire intense," sziid Malcolm Scott '11, “But thcy
an: definitelv beneficial in the long i.un .

Coach Hawsey brings the same intensity towards recruiting
new players for the football team. Many recruits were waiting
to see who the new coach was going to be, rind now that the
outgoing high school seniors are assured of being coached by
Hawsey, it seems to have increased interest in Grinnell. “Re—
cruiting is going well; we have eight new players coming from
early decision," said Hawsey “This includes a very good quar-
rcrback,”

Even though he has only been on the job for about a
month, Grinnelrs newest coach has already begun to change
the landscape. Players seem to agree that his style is much dife
ferent from previous coaches but that it is a good to have a new
face at the helms. "He is much different from Wallace," said
Scott. “But fresh blood is good, and we will win the Conference
championship next season."

With the NCAA Tournament weeks away, and Steve Kerr-

there has to be something for the average sports fan to watch
in order to pass the time. Fortunately, there is the Daytona 500

Hockey. No. seriously.

in the minds ofmauy, hockey has been rele
cgated to a secondetier sport, irreparably hurt
by the lockout. i would disagree. in fact, for
fans of hockey, I would say the lockout has
been nothing butbenefrcial. The new cap sys-
tem that has both a ceiling and a ﬂoor goes a long way to ensur-
ing a competitive balance that this year alone sees the 3A9 seeds
in the Western conference within six points ofone another.

Not to mention that hockey games are very exciting to
watch in person. The speed of the game is breathtaking and
it is infinitely easier to follow the puck, two things that be
come problems when simply watching on television, especially
if the cameraman has an eye like Bryan Berard (4). Add this to
the fact that thc lockout pretty much killcd off all bandwagon
hockey fans, and the NHL stairs to look more and more ap-
petizing.

Unfortunately, the lockout didn’t quite give me what i
wanted—namely the disbandiiig or teams in cit' s that should
have never had them in the first place (I'm looking at you Dale

Indoor track yearns for warmer weather

irv SARAH ERVIN

Last weekend, the Grinnell track team drove to Buena Vista
University in Storm Lake to participate in the second meet of
the new season. the Dennis Young indoor Classic.

Michael Hargadine ’09 won first place in pole vault and Al—
lison Louthan '08 took first in the 3000-metcr run, but both
athletes say that their victories were just practice for the spring
track season.

"There were only four schools there and only about twenty
people," said Louthan. “Everyone knew it would be pretty ree
laxed."

The meet’s lardeback nature allowed athletes to compete
without being too concerned with the outcome of their events,
“A lot of people treated this meet as a workout,” said Charlie
l(nuth,who placed fourth in thc SOC-meter run. “We aren’t rc—
ally concerned with the indoor season.“

Until the snow melts, the team is concentrating on reaching
“peak", avoiding injury, and teaching new recruits the ropes.

“we have a lot of pure beginners," said Coach Will Free-
man. "it's bin and interesting because you have a widc range of
talent and expcrrcnce."

Evelyn rind Will Freeman, who hive coached the Grinncll
track team for 28 years, are both impressed with the work ethic
of the newbies and are optimistic about the team’s conference

prospects.

“We want to be competitive at the conference and see ifwe
can get a couple athletes to qualify for nationals,” said Evelyn
Freeman.

Although outdooi meets will not begin until the snow
melts, the weather has not kept the team’s distance runners
from ti-omping across the icy terrain on ten-mile runs.

Louthali, ivlio is also a member of the cross country team,
explained that although running outdoors in this weather isn't
exactly desireable, indoor practice can be just as hazardous,
“The indoor track is really hard on your knees and I’m allergic
to the treadmill," she stud.

The team hopes to keep injuries at a minimum despite the
strain ofrunning indoors and the icy conditions outdoors. In
December, a member ofthe tcrtm fell rind broke her wrist while
running.

“I want to make it to the conference meet in May without
getting ilijuled,"said Knuth. “Track is pretty rough on people.”

W. Freeman says that the team’s strengths lie in distance
running and pole vaulting, which are both primarily outdoor
events and difficult to practice during the indoor season.

Although there is pole vault equipment in the Grinncll
l’EC, athletes cannot accurately measurc the distancc they’ve
vaulted.
