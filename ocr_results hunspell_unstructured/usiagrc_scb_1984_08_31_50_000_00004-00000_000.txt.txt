Seeing ourselves as others see us

by Mike Cleary

“In Spain, the first thing
American tourists want to do is go
to a bar without being carded."
said Enrique Menor irom Spain.
Other international Students got
some of their first impressions of
America in different ways. Atul
Gupta from New Delhi. India, got
his first impressions of America
from movies and friends who had
gone to America. Movies
presented America as a
dreamland. everyone iree. no
social constraints to obey, and lots
oi money everywhere. His iriends
told him that Americans only care
about money. Menor said he
didn’t know what to expect,

' Regardless of what impressions
they had of America. they wanted
to come and study in America for
another set of reasons. “When you
don‘t know What to do. the best
thing to do is go to America." Said
Jose Garcia Cuartero. also from
Spain. The wide choice of courses
and iields open to study attracted
Grinnell's international students:

especially topics not offered in
their homelands. such as cams
puter science and engineering.
Most of their native countries had
strict course schedules that dic-
tated when the student must take
certain courses. and when he had
to choose his major field or study.
usually in lith grade. Those ma-
jor fields were chiefly science.
arts and social studies.

Upon coming to America. they
had to make certain adjustments,
Tomoko Beppu ol Tokyo, Japan.
remarked that prices were high
here. Eating habits are different;
most of the international students
eat a large lunch and a light din-
ner rather than vice versa. They
had mixed reactions to the
climate. some liking it, others not.

Perhaps the most difficult ad-
justment for most of these new
Students was the last pace oi
everyday lile. “It is much more
relaxed iii Costa Rica." said
Grethel Echeverria of her
homeland. Menor said he is not use
ed to “doing things on time" the
way Americans do Another said
he couldn't usua “stop and
think and have a chat with a
friendH because he was too tied to
his schedule Wolfram Fuchs,
from West Germany. said that he
doesn't find long and involved
discussions here as he does ill Ger
many One student summed it up
by saying that the last and tight
Schedule we follow is "like a
machine, like a program."

The new international students
had many and dilierent observa
tions about American institutions
One student mentioned that we
are very rcligious. People from
his country don't dress up as
much as Americans do when they
go to church. Another noted that it

was strange ior us to have a drink-
ing age. He also found our bars
dark and dreary; where he comes
from, bars are much more fre-
qucnted and social. Another stu-
dent thought that American
presidents don‘t have to be in
telligent or experienced to get
elected.

Two students had studied in
American high schools and had
round them too easy. Cuartero
studied in Sioux City and Menor
studied in Columbia. Mo. They
were surprised by the large
number of As that students
received and also by the lax stan-
dards ior getting into colleges and
universities.

These international students
felt that Americans didn’t know
much about the outside world,
“Americans think too much about
America and forget the rest of the
world." said one.

Menor told about some of the
questions American high school
students asked him' "We said we
were Spanish and they asked if we
were from Mexico or South
America . They asked If we had
TVs and electricity in Spain.
There was a South African student
there and they asked him if he llV-
ed with lions "

Still they observe that

"healthy curiosity" and are in
terested in learning ut other
places when they can. my don't

world. but they try to learn when
they have the opportunity." said
Cuartcro,

Fuchs noted that “people are
active," Echevel‘ria and Menor
pointed out how young people
start to work. Echeverrla was
especially surprised to discover

how hard people work, by working
extra hours and sacrificing free
time. in Spain. said Cuartero, you
get a job after college, “Educa-
tion comes first," he said. Beppu
was probably the most surprised

by this. “My prejudice was that
Americans were lazy." she said
and qtuckly added that she knows
this is wrong.

characteristics They also said
that lamily ies were weak

Americans try to go to distant col-
leges while Spaniards stay close
to home. Gupta felt the Americans

that Americans were on their own

that our individualism Is possible

New students on New Student Days

By Susan Mertzlofl‘t

Here it is folks. New Student
Days (NSD) 7 the Official Scoop,
Drudging up my spiral notepad
and my trusty red papermate. i
went in Search of new students,

Sunday night i hit a bonanza, A
whole Mac field of new students
awaited me at the NSD picnic,
Juggling a footlong, beans,
lemonade and my pen, 1 waded
through the masses until I found
my first interviewee. Mike Miller.
Asked how he would describe NSD
Mike replied. ”Absolutely. ins
credibly awesome." Judging from
his decidedly less»than-dazed
look. I pegged him as a transler
student. ”Mike.” I asked, "what
school did you last attend?" He
answered, “Grinnell.” — So much
for that one!

Finding a group of five people
who looked as if they would like to
be quoted in the Scarlet and
Black. 1 iinposed mysell on their
group, First things lirst. I asked
them ii they were truly new
students and I was gratilied to
hear them answer “yes”.

Asked what he thought of NSD,
Warren Frlntz from Atlanta. Ga
summed it up most succinctly-
"Confusing." Bryan Coughlin

irom rarker, Colo. was slightly
more verbose. He said it as “a
nice way to break into college
life." but added that it already
seemed a bit long All five agreed
they enjoyed the activities, but
still felt a little wet behind the
ears when asked about their ims
pressions of Grinnell,

Alter the picnic i hung up my
spiral for the evening to attend the
outdoor concert by The Wallets, 1
was amazed to see freshmen sit-
ting! They were quietly enjoying
the music. The general consensus
was that a good time was at hand
and they were taking advantage
of it. I must say. however, that I
felt a bit more at home when a
bold group stood up and decided to
dance.

The next day l was out and
about again. I decided to bring a
new angle into my scoop. NSD e a
returning student's perspective.
Spying Karen Jensen. a Junior, in
the Forum Grill. I asked for her
opinion of NSD. She said. “New
student days this year are better
than mine [were]. i think that
they're having more fun.” Anne
Marie Hoskinson, also a junior
agreed With Karen According to

Annelvtarie the people “seemed
to he more enthusiastic this
year."

Following the grumbling in my
stomach, I headed to Cowles for
lunch. It loomed Into sight with a
lull complement oi new students
to interview Hopping from table
to table between bites. I delved
deeper into the grit 0i NSD. I
became excited as I drew Closer to
the answer to that burning ques-
tion. “What are NSD and what do
they mean to the people who at-
tend them'?" Rick Gailing, a
sophomore transler student irom
New York University. answered.
NSD are “a good way to become
acclimated to my new environ-
ment." Two seconds later he turn-
ed to me and asked in a
somethingelessthan-serious tone,
"Was that intellectual enough?"

At the end of an hour in Cowles
and two days ol interviews 1 came
to a few conclusions. Transfer
5 tudents seemed to welcome some
oi the activities. They especially
emoyed those that were aimed at
transfers. They felt it was drains
ing to be around lreshmen for
whom this was a new experience
and whose most common question

was “Is there much homework?"
Overwhemlmingly the transler
students responded that they
would be glad when classes
started on Thursday.

Returning students. “essential"
and “non-essential.” seemed to

didn‘t have to go to classes.
Sophomore Maggie Riekerk said
they were “more laid back ior me
than my own." Maggie was here
as a member of the NSD commit
tee and added that she was glad
that they were running smoothly.
Joe Cunningham. also a
sophomore, saidhe doesn't “want
to start classes. i enjoy goofing
around.”

The freshmen gave me the most
diversified answers. Scot
Brackenridge thought that NSD
were a “helluva good time." but
then added that he only came to
Grinnell so that he could stay
overnight in Newton, Iowa. the
night before he arrived at the
school,

Sandy Stein thought that
everyone was “an exaggeration oi
who they really are" but It was
still a “nice way to break in,”
Brian Jacobson said it was “a

these students made about
Americans was that they were
“friendly and opensminded." “i
didn’t expect Americans to be so
friendly," says Atul Gupta. ”Peo-
ple want to know you,” said
Cuartero, up,

However, they also thought that
while Americans have many
friends, close friendship is hard to
find. “Friends" means “acquaine
tances” in America. according to
these students. One said that
American friendships tend to be
superficial. Another felt that there
wasn't “deep loyalty" between
friends.

Fuchs emphasized how “infors
mal" Americans were. saying
also there is too much “social
closedeness” in Germany. Beppu
was surprised to see how students
mixed with prolessors.

On the whole. the new interna
tional students seemed to like
Americans and their fellow
students. Some remarked that
people here treated them as

When asked for their impress

lreshmen politely declined to
answer. although a few even balk-
ed at the idea oi attempting to
sum up the Grinnell Experience.
Muiiy Clarahan ventured an "I
like the campus.” while another
student said only “my SA did an
excellent job oi making me leel
welcome." However. he couldn't
remember the SA’s name!

The question the lreshmen
answered the best was "Where
are you lrom'!" i received
answers as unusual as North

Kansas City and as common as

describe what they thought oi
Grinnell College and people said
they came here for reasons as
diversified as“Ilovedltl"and“It

applied to. and oh. yeah, I liked
it."

Freshman Karl Gergh summed
NSD up the best. "It's great! use
