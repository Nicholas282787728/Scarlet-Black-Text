In his lecture Monday evening. Chaliand
said that the purpose of terrorist acts is to
get media coverage, But with more and
more states becoming involved, he feels
that “the new terrorism of ,Cuercive
diplomacy is a more dangerous one.”
Chaliand drew fire from members of the
audience during the discussion that follow-
ed the lecture. Some students criticized
him for not including in his discussion of

“Who deserves the label terrorism?"
one student demanded. .

“Do you think the U.S. deserves the label
of terrorist?” Chaliand asked.

“or France for that matter. Didn't they
admit they bombed the Greenpeace

“I would label that sabotage and an act
of terrorism. All right But I would not
call France a terrorist state in itself, The
principal definition of France is not a ter-
rorist state nor is it in the case of the U.S.

you can vote tor whoever you want and I
can vote ior someone else but nevertheless

“You‘ve been talking about state ter-
rorism and related it to diiierent counr
tries. The. us. with the cm . 'n
Nicaragua or by supporting the white
South African government, 1 think that's a

He added, “The French government leit
the Basque terrorists hide in their country
tor many years.,.i think that is in a way
state terrorism." ‘

“I don’t call the support of the United

_ SGA Briefs

by Sara Deichman

Hall senators will be going to their con
stituents this week to get the opinions of
the halls about the proposed amendments
to the initiative by-laws. These amend»
ments were approved this week. but they
need approval two weeks in a row lor them
to be passed. This is a very important mat-
ter, please give your senators your
cooperation And. it you senator accidenr
lally iorgets to show you the amendments
and explain what they mean. please ask
him lor her) to do so. Your voice hopeiully
does make a difference. so let it be heard!

The amendments essentially would not
allow campus issues to be voted on as in
itiativés. These issues would therefore be
voted on by joint board, thus giving hall
senators more power.

Theoreticallyv hall senators are
representatives of their dorms and should
vote as their dorms wish them to vote. This
means that senators should go to their con
stituents and ask them how they wish an

issue to be voted on beihre the senator ac-
tually votes, Unfortunately this usually
does not occur as demonstrated two weeks
ago with the letter from SGA supporting
the faculty's resolution concerning the
acts of homophobia on campus. Senators
were told by Joint Board to hold hall
meetings during which they were to show
their constituents the letter. and ask them
whether or not to approve it. Of the 22
senators present at the Joint Board
meeting. only three had held meetings 7
they were the representatives of Norris,
Smith. and James. Those senators that did
not know the opinion of their dorms on this
issue voted entirely on their own behalves
The letter was turned down aiter lengthy
debate. This Week there was an all campus
initiative concerning the same issue.,0t
the 636 students that voted on the issue. 562
voted in favor, as against, and 31 abstain»
ed. The results of this initiative clearly
show that the student body gives its sup
port to the faculty's decision.

Republicans

ment in South Africa. The demonstration.
By Matteson and other conservatives. was
“blasted" by the Scarlet and Black, At no
time, according to Matteson, were any oi
the demonstrators contacted by the paper
to comment on the aim or purpose oi the
demonstration. Matteson also points out
that a prodivestment demonstration that
occurred at the same time was “virtually
not touched on" by the paper.

A recent complaint or the College
Republicans has been directed at the Pro~
gram in Practical Political Education. a
subdivision oi the Rosenfield Program.
which brings political speakers to campus,

Matteson thinks that this tall the PPPE
more heavily recruited Democratic
political candidates than it did Republican
candidates, He ieels that this undermines
what the college community is all about.
“The college as a learning environment

should do everything it can to bring in'

speakers on both sides oi an argument.”
Matteson said.

Wayne Moyer. chairman oi the Rosen-
tield Program. disputes the contention oi
unequal recruiting oi candidates He

Republicans have to
work harder, they 1stand
out wit more and they
have to :be more solid on

thié’i'rw'uitiivi than the
Demogrots. f

Claims that in the [all the PPPE did not
recruit speakers to come to the campus ex»
cept in one case. “It is not our job to go out
and beat the bushes to get candidates to

from page 1

come except in the interest oi equality
says Moyer.

The one case oi active recruitment this
tall involved Republican congressional
candidate John McIntee After the
Democratic candidate {or the congres-

sional seat. Dave Nagle, contacted the col-

lege and set up is speaking engagement.
Moyer actively pursued McIntree to give
him an equal opportunity to speak. ‘

Meyer's opinion is somewhat similar to
Matteson's when discussing the kind of
balance the college should have when
presenting diiierent viewpoints. “Balance
is important in a college community at all
levels," Moyer said.

But he contends the balance should not
be based on a Republican/Democrat come
parison or even on that of conserr
vativeJliberal, “There are variants on
conservative _Views and Variants on
liberal views...to me, it’s more important
that we have divergent views...pro-
vocative views that will make people
think." i

On the difficulties facing Republicans.
Moyer echoes some of Matteson’s opi-
nlons. “They have to work-harder, they
stand out more and they have to be more
solid on their views than the Democrats,"
he said. - .

But he also feels that the campus accep»
tance of conservative views is increasing.
"When I came here, in 1972. it was unaCV
ceptable to be a Republican here.,.I've
seen an increase in the college community
to listen to their case." Matteson agrees
with this observation. “It’s definitely im-
proving irom when i was a ireshman.
There are fewer radical liberals...and
there are more conservatives speaking
up.” ,

The long range atmosphere is not likely
to change much, however. and Mayer is

‘quick to point that out. V“i don‘t see the

campus closing up...but. it‘s not going to
be evenly divided either. I don’t see it her
ing 50% Republicans and 50%.
Democrats.”
