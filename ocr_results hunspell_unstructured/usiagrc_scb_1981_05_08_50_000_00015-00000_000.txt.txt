pril 24 was a disturbingly inaccurate,
justiﬁed attack upon the students at
-mpting to provide a muchdesired
ervice by organizing the Cyclone,
irinnell‘s new yearbook. l suppose if
nllock chooses to hold a low opinion of
use people and that publication
ithoiit having seen it, then he may do
i but he is not entitled to assail their ef~
arts with an article of errors and lies.

['1] give the Doctor some credit in
at the ’79—'86 yearbook could have
it better. He accuses that book of

ving been “unrepresentative, elitist
substandard.“ He doesn't deﬁne

it I,k which upon reading the rest of his
rticle become more obviously his la»
ent, “Why don't you guys mke lots of
ctures of me?"

HIS argument induces that Mike
- exander and Dan Flynn are m-
ompetenls. batching up the whole job
. cause they didn't take pictures of him
In two occasions. on the first occasion
“group' photo of two people was to be
.ken Alexander made an editorial
iecision not to use such a photo and had
he integrity to tell Pollock before the
hoto date (the easy approach would
ave been to take the photo and then not
a use it). Pollock responds by telling
he editors how they could lay out 12
hotos of olfcampus study' groups,
ven though he admitted only one
. ragraph belore that he knows that no
ther groups have tried to submit
-hotos. That tact should have made him
ealize that it's not easy to make an
“entirely representative" yearbook
ince the editors can’t force group
uhotos to be taken. The second occasion
'nvolved a group photo of the staff of
IIC. The “top brass" of KDIC told
Pollock that he could organize a photo it
it was representative. meaning if a
good majority ol the slatl would be in-
luded. This would not have been the
case Pollock claims that he called
“every single D " to advise them of the
photo but I’ve talked to no fewer than 20
that received no phone call, no note, no
nothing. That number in itsell pretty
much negates the chances ol the photo
having been representative so why does
Pollock complain? He's the one ln-
sisting upon a “representative" year

Like it or not the Cyclone can on-

ly include photos or persons who show' ,
up on photo sessions (which they have > >

to know about Doc) It would be stupid
to claim rive lo or even 20 people com-
posed the stall of KDlC Not to take
such a photo should be interpreted as a
move away trom elitism,

Pollock got his feelings hurt'because
the editors wouldn‘t give him his way
and so he wans us all to know that they

are either “incompetent or iust'pla'
lazy." That s a strong accusation but so
is mine The only diilerence. is that
mine seems tn‘he consistent with the
facts. Pollock calls {or a boycott but he
bought a yearbook 'l appreciate the e;
fort oi Flynn and Alexander and will»
buy one too it tor no other reason than v?
to count pictures of Pollock and see 'i
hes one of the lucky elit
