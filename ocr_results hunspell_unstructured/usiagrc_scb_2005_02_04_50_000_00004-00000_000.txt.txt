GESD opens up
lending library

BY LOLA GARCIA

Nearly a year in the making, Guns
nellians for Economic and Social Di-
versity (GESD) has its textbook lend-
ing iiblaty up and running.

The textbook lending librlily has
about six hundred volumes, about half
of which have been catalogued. The li-
brary is located in the Forum basement
in the former SOL offices and has a
hired student librarian.

Members of GESD first cxploied
setting up a textbook library when the
group was rounded at rhe fall semester-
of2003. Cuefollnders MargaretToonv
cy ‘06 and Alfredo Rivera ‘06 created
the group to assist tirsrrgeneration col-
lege students and students ofworking»
class families.

Last April, in an open letter to the
college community, membels ofGESD
requested the resources fora lending li-
braty, as well as asked faculty members
to be sensitive to prices when creating
book lists and encouraged that text-
book costs be taken into account when
treating nnaneial aid packagesToomcy
worked closely with the ofﬁce of Stir
dent Life and finally got the green light
on the lendinglibrary lastspring. She is
now the paid librarian,

According to Toomey, soon after
the library's approval, collection boxes
went in “nearly every" dorm recycling
room on earapus. While mueh more
than the six hundred volumes were due
nated, many were not textbooks. Others
were out ofdate or were course paekets,
Right now Toorney said she is tonsidr
ering selling the other books in order to
generate more money for the library.

Toomey and other members had
originally hoped to target certain lows
ineome students for use of the library

“Originally we had wanted to plovide
for students spetinraily ﬂagged front
[the Office of] Financial Aid," said
Toomey. She explained that they had
wanted to [ind students that were fed—
eral Pell Grant recipients oi had Staf-
ford loans.

Because otprivaey issues, the Olrtee
nfsnldcnl Affairs asked that the libtaiy
be made available to everyone.

only about ten students have made
use of the library so fart “At this point
were still trying to get out the word,"
said Toomey, Posters tor the library had
just gone up as ofMonday.

In older to check out books, stu-
dents should email [gesd] with their
requests or can make an appointment,
Toomey hopes to have a lending library
website eventually.

LeAnn Wilson ‘07 found out about
the library from reading Toomey's
L.velournal. Another user, Laura Le~
Von ‘06, was a member of GESD last
year and helped plan the library. LcVon
said the library was able to provide the
“more expensive books for history” as
well as some others. She estimates she
saved between $120 and $150 by using
the library

Toomey had also sent out an email
to several professors asking them to
forward word of the library to their
students, Phoebe Souza ‘08 received a
forwarded email from her Spanish pro-
fessor with a list of Spanish books in
the GESD library While Sotlza could
only find a few books for her class, she
said she wasn’t disappointed with the
library “I think anything is better than
nothing," she said, “and 1 was really sure
prised beeause I had no idea anything
like this even existed."

Theatre (re)opens downtown

BY ERIC RoHN

While Iowa City and Des Moines may have more
possibilities ror things to do on any given weekend,
downtown Grinnell has just gotten a serious enter-
tainment upgrade with the reopening oftllc strand
Theatie. Once again,studcnts and town residents can
see new feature films without driving twenty minutes
or more.

The Strand Theatre, located on Main Street, was
operating as Grinnell's only movie theater when it
closed in 2003 due to financial reasons. However, a
group ormvestors and other citizens raised the funds
to reopen the historic theatre, originally built in
1916.

In addition to renovating and reopening the mov-
ie theater, a great deal of money was raised through
eontributrons and memberships by a group called the
Marquee Club rot restoring the hisrorie facade of the
building, which had been covered over during the

19605.

The three sereens otthe renovated and expanded
Strand Theatre building feature a combination of
independent films aimed at drawing a college audi-
ence and Hollywood films marketed to families, Now
playing are T/Jt'Avirllm; White Naitl, and the highly
aeelnimed independent film Sideways, and new ﬁlms
are expected nearly weekly, said Strand manager Mart
Deppe.

Sideways is the first real experiment," said Deppe,
and from the attendance he's seen so far it’s likely that
the theatre will bring more independent ﬁlms

While most of the business has come from town
families, Grinnell college students have turned out in
large numbers, mostly for Sidawoyr. So far,business at
the strand has been successful, according to Deppe.
Some of the more popular family films "sell out on
weekends," he said.
