Letter oi Woman's Council of psieusc
Finds neatly Response in England

Grinnell women will be interested in
the letter expressing the sympathy of
Americans for the people of the Uni
‘ed Kingdom, and the answer from
Queen Mary.

The tollowing cablegram was sent
to the Queen of England, in the name
of Dr. Anna. Howard Shaw. of the
Woman's Committee of the Cuuhcn of
National Defense, as a. message from
all the loyal women at America, to
strengmen the sympathy at the Women
oi the two countries.

“The Woman’s Committee of the
Council of National Defense, rep e~
senting every loyal Woman in Amer a,
is anxious that at this crisis in the
world war your Majesty should he as-
shred. and through your Majesty lev-
el‘y woman in Great Britain, that dur-
ing over two years of the war their
sisters in America have Watphed with
admiration and perfect conﬁdence the
fortitude, the unfaltering purpose and
unﬂagging effort Df the women of the

United Kingdom to further the cause.

which they had at heart, and for
which their men have been facing
death in the ﬁeld. Now that the Unit-
ed States of America has .i ined hands
with Britain, France and Italy in this
last and greatest of all crusades, we,
the true daughters of democracy, feel
that a new year should not open with-
out a word of cheer, of trust, and or
complete and thorough cooperation
to those who have sunered and nobly
eudurcd trials and sorrows which must
now be our own lot. We are proud to
be associated with them. We say on—
hesitatingly that we shall [)l'esevel'e
with them to the end. We ask your
Majesty to tell our sisters across the
seas that, no matter what the cost.
America will be loyal to her pact and
that none will manifest their loyalty
more thoroughly in word and deer]
than the women of this country."

The following answer was received
from Queen Mary:

“Please convey to the sisterhood or
your great country the warm thanks
of the Women of the British Empire
for their inspiring words of encnu
agement and assurance. The horro
of war have taught us to know one
another better and they have strength—
ened the ties or liinsbip and mutual
sympathy by uniting the women of the
English-speaking races heart and soul
in the struggle for liberty and civiliza-
tion. ’

“Conﬁdent of the valuable help we
women can give our gallant soldiers
and sailors, I pray for God’s richest
blessing on our eitor Mary R."

LIVING-ROOMS
(viu Editorial)

The club ooms in the various cot-
tages were provided as living-rooms,
and were intended to be used. Thus
far they have not been used as much
as they deserve. For one reason,
there is a total lack of reading materi-
al there.

It has been suggested that the cot-
tages as units subscribe for papers
and magazines tor the use ot the Whole
building. The expense could be met
by the regular house dues.

For girls who do not use the news-
paper room regularly, newspapers in
the living-room would be it great can»
venience, besides adding to the livable-
ness of the room. Magazines and pa-
pers would be an inducement to use
the living—rooms zts they were intended
and as they deserve. The cottage club-
rooius could be made “livingri'noms”
instead of “places,”

The compressor System or Pumping
almost Ready to Install—
Tanks Full.

(From Grinnell Herald.)

Due to the saving in city Witter
made by shutting off the supply at
nights, Grihnell is now in better
condition than she has been for
some time. The compressor system
of pumping is almost ready to in-
stall and as soon as every detail
is ready the change will be made.
in the meantime the council wishes
to impress upnn the people the need
of the utmost economy in the use
of water.

Lafayette Higgins, of the state
heard 01 health, was in Grinnelli
saturday, investigating the filter
beds and seemed quite interested in
the proposed plan or going to the
river ior Water. He made the point
that in case Grinnell could get a
suDDly 0f soft water it would elim~
inate considerable trouble with the
inter beds as the hard Witter now
in use is very hard on the sewer
system.

Professor Ford, of Ames, who was
in Grinnell last week, and looked
over the situation is expected to re-
port soon. He was at the river
While here and took sunﬁsh of
that water and from the springs
nearer the city. His report is await-
ed with particular interest as he
will be able to submit figures on
the probable cost of pumping from
the river and as to Whether the
ten mile lift of 282 feet will nec-
essitate the installation of a house
ter station about half way between
the river and the city.
