No limits: expanding neutrality policies

Jim Malewitz ‘09 thinks that the dining hall should remain neutral on matters of pride

If you hear the word "neutrality," what
images come to mind.> Besides perhaps a pro»
World War I Woodrow Wilson or a crossed»
out Fox News logo, I’m guessing this concept
paints a whole lot of nothing upon your ment
tal slate.

But while neutrality may scam to represent
a rather dull topic, this unassuming concept
took center stage in a conﬂict two Fridays ago,
illustrating a reactionary nairow—sightedness
which sometimes plagues members of our
campus.

As reported by
the 5&3 last Frir
day, a group ofstu-
dents were denied
access to the dining
hall because they
planned on dis
playing pride ﬂags
within its walls.

Dining Services refused them entrance by
citing that the planned display would have vi-
olated the hall’s previouslyrestablished polrcy
of neutrality. But in typical Grinnell fashion.
the students involved deﬁantly snuck the ﬂags
into the dining hall and petitioned adminisr
trators to change the long-standing rule in
question.

This episode comes on the heels ora simi-
lar quarrel over whether or not the adminis—
tration should permit students to display the
pride ﬂag on the outside orcnmpus mailber
cs.

So let’s get to the root ofthis conflict. Arc
we to look at this issue as another obstacle
impeding the forward progress ofthe LGBT
community? Do these policies showcase a
lack of understanding on the part of Dining
Services? Should we view the ﬂag bearers as
the Rocky Balboa to the administration's Ivan
Drago?

I understand the students passion in sup-
porting and defending the LGBT cause —
especially in light of the circumstances gov-
erning this semester, But to the objective eye,

this issue has nothing to do with ideological
intolerance,

In close exami ltion of this Situation, I
would bill it as a clash between pragmatism
and ideologicallyrmotivated narrow sighted-
ness.

As said in the article, Dick Williams, di-
rector ofDlning services, administration exr
erciscs neutrality“in order to respect the rights
and beliefs ofall students.”But as peronc ﬂagt
bearing student, this explanation simply “up-
set" the group,
who construed
it as an accusa-
tion that “people
would be oft
fended by the
ﬂags "

Arguing rn
this manner,
the ﬂagrsneaking students have completely
missed the policy's sound logic.

Perhaps this is just another case in winch
ideological fervor has prohibited a group or
students from looking at a situation with any
semblance ofopcnrminded rationality.

While the LGBT movement iniiy have
many champions on campus, it isn't flppl'opll’
are to treat participation as a universal value,

Whether or not you deem it your obligat
tiou to exhibit gay pride, the simple reality is
that not everyone possesses this same emo-
tion. For herein lies the key operative in Wil-
liams’s explanation ofthe dining hall’s policy:
it protects “all students,“ not just a speciﬁc
group, While tolerance should be universal,
pride is personal.

I accept people regardless of racc, creed,
sexuality or preference of baseball teams
(unless they cheer for the Yankees). But this
doesn’t mean that I should be expected to ex-
hrbrt pride in all Hispanic bisexuals, practicr
ing Judaism whilst cheering for the Toronto
Blue Jays.

While such characteristics would have
no bearing on whether or not I chillaxed

with someone on the weekend, I cannot CX’
hibit pride in a characteristic which I do not
hold.This is the concept these ﬂags represent
— pride in a personal attribute exhibited witlit
in a respectable campus group. The colored
stripes speciﬁcally represent diversity within
the LGBT community, not our population as
a whole. 1 would not he offended by the pres
ence of pride ﬂags in the dining hall. But just
as I may a Canadian, south African or Mem-
phis Grizzlies ﬂag, I would question their ap-
propriateness.

What itthe dining hall chose to abandon
its practice of neutrality? Would it go'unnot
ticed if I set up a small nativity set by the plat
clu jour as Christmas approached? How about
a crescent moon and star for Ramadan? And
don't forget to hang an effigy on Guy Fawkes
Day.

The dining hall could turn into a made
house, adding at least a few more minutes to
my wait in line for the blue light special.

This is why the principle of neutrality ex—
ists 7 to enable all students to enjoy chicken
nugget and macaroni day without controversy
With its carnivorous,vegctarian and vegan op
tions for everyone, the dining hall continually
goes the extra mile in tolerating our diverse
and often fickle pallets.

So what shall we take from this contro—
versy? While it is easy to get caught up in the
tervor which may accompany the passionate
support ofa cause,we shouldn't let it cloud our
overall sense of rationality.

we all have our priorities, but not all or
them coincide. While observance ofthe quiet
principle ofneutrality may prove annoying for
outspoken members of our campus, it exists
for a greater reason.

It is irresponsible and irrational to expect
to change a broad set ofwell functioning rules
simply to accommodate one person or group,
But by simply stepping back and taking time
to peer through some pragmatic peepers, we
will be much better able to stop and smell the
gooey butter bars.

A last word from the managers of Lyle’s pub

In last week's issue of the S {$8, the pub
was depicted as mismanaged and disorga-
nized. In their article, Katie McMulien and
Matt Zmudka asserted that the pub “faces set
rious issues concerning sales ratios, financial
solvency, and management communication."
They imply that we have failed to cope with
“start—up costs, unfamiliar markets, and un-
tested organization strategies.” In response,
weias graduating managersiwould like to
state our perspective on the progress of the
pub under our tenure, our analysis ofcurrem
ﬁnances and our vision for the future of the
pub,

When the pub conducted its experir
mental opening February 16, a substantial
portion of the current deficit had already
accrued, according to ﬁgures provided by
Accounting. Indeed, the majolity or this
figure appears to constitute start-up costs,
such as the $5,465.80 spent in equipment
acquisitions this semester, the $2,357.10
spent in taxes, insurance and licensing costs
and the $1,811.70 in wages dispensed in the
month or February. Attcr accounting for
sales and expenditures, we estimate our dcfi~
cit through February to be 513,230.42, A
dcconstructive analysis of the financial data
on the pub creates a diff nt picture than
McMullen and Zmudkas conclusron on our
progress, It takes capital to purchase rnrra-
structure, and it can take years to recoup inir

tial investments.

Last week‘s article appears to question
our experience and foresight in terms of
managing a startrup business. As managers,
we draw from a wide background in food
service, We have served students and faculty
at Care Phoenix, Grinnell Coffee company,
Lonnski’s Pub and Dell and Grinnell Col-
lege Dining Services to familiarize ourselves
with our market, Manager susan Klumpner
helped run Lawrence University's Campus
Pub. In many of these businesses, we have
held leadership positions, helped train em-
ployees, maintained operations in the ab-
sence of managers, managed ﬂnances and
participated in the opening of new ventures.
We integrated these experiences into our
design or the pub.

Furthermore, the pubs challenge is to
create a space on campus that is accessible
and enjoyable to as much or our campus
community as possible. A city ordinance
states we must mail 1in a sales ratio of a
maximum 50% alcohol sales versus all other
sales in order to pemit entrance to 18r20~
yearrolrls. We do not want the pub to be a
dividing space on campus. In addition to
making the pub accc bit: to all we also
want to achieve a certain level of financial
sustainability. The pub pays a student wage
ofs750/hour whereas bars pay below mrnr
mnrn wage and let their servers collect the

majority of earnings in rrps. our rneuu is
limited to items we cart prepare in our mi-
crowave and toaster oven—the two items
budgeted for which actually matriculated
(originally, the pub was also budgeted for a
restaurantrquality deeprfiit fryer), We have
also been constrained in the amount ofhours
we are open.

In less than three months ofbe‘ing open,
the pub has hosted a number of community
events, such as concerts by Vegetable Medley
and Con Brio, a reception for Senior Chal-
lenge, a Departmental Trivial Pursuit toutr
nament and weekly Quizzo. Some nights,
the pub has been ﬁlled nearly to capacity,
other nights we have entertained only a few
regulars, We have experimented with both
hours and offerings in an effort to promote
food sales and gauge our own market.

We envision the pub as a community
space, a vehicle for campus unity. We want
to reach sustainability expedienrly, but not
at the expense of quality or service in our
opening period or our institutionalization
as a campus fixtuic. We don’t see our debt
as insurmountable. This debt is quite main
ageable and frankly rypical for this kind of
venture The bottom line rs that this rs your
pub. It takes the investment ofa community
to burld a place like this on campus.
