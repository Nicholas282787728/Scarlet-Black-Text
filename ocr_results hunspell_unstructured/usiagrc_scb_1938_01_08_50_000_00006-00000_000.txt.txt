THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, JANUARY 8, 1938

 

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

BY WEus BARNETT

We have received a leiter from
Bob Kunkel, of the University of
North Dakota, president oi the
National Intercollegiate Sports
Writers' association. and editor of
the 1938 Dacotah, in which he
suggests that the North central
Intercollegiate conference might
be a good place for Grinnell to
land after having withdrawn from
the Missouri Valley.

3 s l

The Now includes Morningside,
Omaha, Iowa state Teachers,
North and South Dakota umverSA
ities and North and South Dakota
State. It is understood, according
to Kunkel, that Carleton will
probably be added.

The suggestion is an interesting
one and offers some possibilities
for the Pioneers, but there are
certain rather apparent obstacles
which would make the choice of
that conterence a poor one. In
the first place Ncrc includes only
one of the traditional rivals the
Pioneers have been meeting for a
number of years. That is Iowa
State Teachers The others are
schools we rarely. if ever, meat.
It is very likely that interest here
in such a setup would he very
low.

At the some time, it would
mean that Grinnell would have to
play more than half its conference
games with North or South Da-
kota schools. which would certain-
ly cost almost as much as com
peting with the southern schools
now found in the Valley. Morer
over, the set-up of schools seems
to indicate that Grinnell would not
fit in very well, some of the
schools being of relatively high
calibre and some relatively low.
with no ill-between: of about
Grinnell’s size, strength and par
tentialities.

We have also been shown a
clipping from a column printed
by Dave Sutherland, editor of the
Montezuma Republican. Dave is
an old friend of Lowrie Frishie of
the Grinnell Heraldnegister, and
a Grinnell graduate who last year
did his very heat, through the
medium of letters to Frisbie, to
make life uncomfortable for us.
As a result, we can't resist the
chance to point out some of the
more obvious stupidities in his
.latest phillipic.

. s s.

In the first place, Sutherland
claims that Grinnell's withdrawal
from the Valley “will have a
tendency to bring down the all-
around high standards maintained
by the school,” Assuming that
he means academic standards, the
absurdity of his conclusion is
easily apparent. What possible
effect could Grinnell’s withdrawal
from an athletic conference have
on her scholastic standing?

v 2 e

Dave's solution for the whole
problem is to “change the atti-
tude of certain college professors
whose opinions are at consider-
able variance with prcsent-day air
fairs." Another far-fetched con-
clusion, blaming Grinnell's lack of
athletic success on certain pro-
fessors here who happen to hold
advanced pol' cal views We
might add, as an aside, that pro»
fessors here and elsewhere have

 

just as much right to any opinions
they please as does Mr. Suther-
land.
e o I
Mr, Sutherland nlso adds, with
characteristic lack of insight, that

_ in the old days Grinhell used to

heat quite a few top-notch schools,
completely forgetting that in
those long-gone halcyon days suh-
sidization was unknown, and that
in the times when we would beat
Minnesota, that school was still an
agricultural college, little larger
than Grinnell. But presentrday
conditions. to which Dave blithely
refers and then completely ignoresi
are different, and this college is’

unwillinginnd unableito carry
on a large-scale subsidization pro-
gram in competition with other
schools which are larger, better-
situated geographically to attract
crowds and wealthier.

e . r

Enough of that. We are hlhppy
to record that Erik Voss, former
Grinnell swimmer, has been given

All-American honorable mention
in 50—yd. freestyle by the Nation
al Intercollegiate Athletic Associa—
tion.

"Judicial Machine
Mus’r be Speeded
Up," Valehﬁne

“We've got to speed up our
judicial machinery,” John Valen—
tine, lieutenant governor of Iowa.
told members of the Pre-Law club
at their meeting Thursday night.

Speaking of the proposal for an
integrated har, currently before
the people of the state, Valentine
said, “Lawyers have fallen from
grace. The future is none too
rosy unless we get our house in
order, We've got to organize, get

in one group, to accomplish this.”

Speaking specifically of the plan
he told the club members that
some 20 states have provided for
an integrated bar either by legiSA
lation or supreme court action.

He listed as advantages of the
plan the elimination of undesir—
able lawyers, raising standards,
eliminating unauthorized practices,
and adjusting court procedures
and practices to place them “in
tune with the times."

In conclusion valentine told club
members, “Every lawyer should
get into politics," but added,
”don't do as I have. In my case

[the tail is wagging the dog."

 

 

Fletcher Valentine knows tobacco

Yes—and that isn’t all.
"It‘s Toasted” takes out certain irritants naturally
present in all tobacco—even the ﬁnest! The result
is that you will ﬁnd Luckies not only taste good

volues...|ike so many other Inde-
pendent experts he smokes luckies!

"I’VE bought 4,000,000 pounds of tobacco at auc-
tions in the past ten years,” says Mr. Valentine,
independent buyer of Westﬁeld, N. C., "and my
bread' and butter depends on making the right
bids. That’s Why I have to know tobacco values.

"Now I've smoked Luckies ever since 1918, and the
reason is, they suit my taste to a ‘T'. Nobody knows
better than we tobacco men that Luckies are made
of the ﬁnest center-leaf tobacco."

Luckies’ exclusive process,

but are easy on your throat.

Surely, independent experts like Mr.Valentine make
good judges of cigarettes . . . Sworn records show

that, among independent tobacco experts, Luckies

have twice as many exclusive smokers as have all

other dgarertes combined!
