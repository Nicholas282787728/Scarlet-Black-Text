BISHOP MACDOWELL IN CHAPEL.

An inspiring Address Upon the
Subject or a christian
Education.

This morning the students listened
to a very enjoyable chapel address by
Bishop lracnoncll of the Methodist
church. lrr. MneDowel] has been
prominent in educational circles for a
considerable period and is thoroughly
enropport with the student spirit or a
modern college. His address contain-
ed a sound message and was enlivened
by dashes of wit which though ocea—
sionally inducing an unappropriate
levity played an important part in
impressing his talk upon his hearers.

He described and explained Paul’s
deﬁnition ora Christian education.
In the iirst place-wc must not quench
the spirit that is in us. We must not
lose our capacity for visions and
dreams but must also be carerul not
to carry them so iar that we become
mystics. Again we must notdesplse
prophecies butmust take account of
the world's history. We must keep
our ruptures subyect to experience.
Thirdly we are to bring these two be-
iore the test of lite and ask ourselves
if these facts are worthy to live by.
our criterion here must be life rather
than logic. Finally we must let no
term of evil come into our lives to
destroy this which we have found.
This, said Bishop MacDowell, if fully
carried out is Paul‘s symphony or
education.

Dr. Winsllip presented to us what

gram of the biennial meeting olthe
Iowa Federation of Womcns Clubs
which convenes at Waterloo May 9 to

The Chicago pape-- or last weal:

report that/a. conference of ﬁvc Cun-
gl‘egﬂtioual colleges was held in Ohi-
cngo last week to consider asking Anr
drew Carnegie for the sum of $5,000
000 for permanent endowment for the
ﬁve colleges, which Sum should be ad-
ministered ior the live colleges by a
trustee or joint committee. The ﬁve
colleges were Beloio, Knox, Colorado,
lVaSllbul‘ll and Grlnhell. The presi-
dents of Knox, Beloiry and Colorado
colleges were appointed acommittee
to approach lrr. Carnegie on the sub-
ject. Mr. Carnegie was opposed to
giving money to educational institu-
tions formerly but in a speech in New
York last week he said thaohe was
an advocate of the small colleges and
proposed to help them.

The [allowing paragraph although
rather old news is reprinted for the
compliment paid our president, Doc-
tor Dan F. Bradley:

President Bradley preached in the
Congregational church at Ynnkton.
S. D.,,0n March 19 and assisted the
church in raising a debt which was
incurred in the recent errection or a
new building. Mr. Bradley was Very
Successiul in his moms and the Data
kctilu Gillette in Speaking 0! him
says: ”He amply sustained his re<
putation as a good story teller. Peo-
ple morvelled it his ready memory
ror‘nanies and his happy allusions to
Old friends. Dr. Bradley’s practical
and llelplui address on bile ”All
Around Mall” followed, and was list,-
ened to with closest attention by the
great audience. The sound wisdom,
sane. clear thinking and rich friendlh
ness of this many-sided man leltrit
deep impression on all who heard
him."

Two members of the Iowa College
Faculty attended the Southeastern
Iowa Teachers Association last. week.
Prolessnr w. J. Rusk read a paper on
"The Place of Arithmeticin the High
School Curriculum” in which he ar-
gued in iavor ciputting it in the ﬁrst
yeitz OI Lile high school course. This
suggestion was considered very im-
portant and has created a considerable
amount of comment. Doctor W. S.

 

Hendrixson took an active part in the
college section. His Subject was upon
the control or athletics; in colleges
and the discussion furnished by him
is described as being both interesting

 

and valuable.
