President Hugo Chavez
recently announced con-

troversial plans to ﬁlrther his

socialist agenda. The former

paratrooper commander who once

referred to President Bush as “the devil” released plans to
nationalize some of his country's major businesses within
the oil, telecommunications, and utility industries, many of
which have American stakeholders.Therc were even reports
of government plans to seize certain kinds of private property,
such as vacation homes or luxury yachts, from the country's
wealthiest citizen a claim upon which Chavez equivocated.

Chavez’s adm istration also recently rejected the licenses
renewal application of the country's largest opposition tele s
sion channel and restricted the ability of NGOs within Ven—
ezuela to raise funds from abroad. He has requested special
powers from (114: country’s legislative body enabling him to
establish a number of socialist measures on his own. Oppor
nents have decried Chavez’s steps as a consolidation ofpower
aimed at furthering his own authoritarian rule, and not the
democratic socialism he supports.

Despite an attempted coup by the opposition party,
Chavez has achieved considerable domestic popularity. Over
the past ten years, Venezuela’s household poverty rate has
dropped from 55 to nearly 34 percent and private business is
growing by 10 percent presently .

New position wi

Bv ERIN MCKEE

The Grinnell administra-
tion plans to hire a Diversity
Coordinator who will work
directly with the president in
overseeing the diversity poli-
cy and promoting diversity at
Grinnell.

According to President
Russell K. Osgood, “the Cole
lege should invest more in
this achievement." This coor»
dinator will deal with recruit»
ment, accommodations for
disabled students and staff,
and support for multicultural
students To do so, the Di-
versity Coordinator will work
with the other administrative
offices and the President to
ensure that the diversity pol-
icy is being upheld and that
student and faculty needs are
being met, In addition, the
Diversity Coordinator will
work to recruit more diverse
college community members.

Investlng

Coordinator Hired:

incorporate senior counselor Frank Thomas’s duties
and imclude other role

This position is not techs
nically a new one, but is aCs
rually a repackaging of du—
ties. Senior Counselor Frank
Thomas has
carried out
many of the

Coordina»
tor’s du-
ties in the
past, such
as federal
regulation
compliance issues and work-
ing with diversity on campus.
Thomas, who previously was
Vice President for Diversity,
is planning to leave .Grinnell
within the next few years, and
the new position will ensure
that someone will continue
to coordinate diversity eﬂbrts
at Grinnell. “Frank Thomas
did most of what this posi-
tion will do," said Osgood,
“but this person will be doing

”/rspeaks a lot about Grinnell

Dive rs ity that they realize they need

someone to ﬁll lharposlrlon.”

more."

Some of the duties, such
as the recruitment of multi-
cultural students, will become

one of the
Diversity
Coordina—
tor’s new
r e s p o n -
Sibilitics.
“The rec
c r u i t i n g
n u m b e r s
[of multi-
cultural students] have gone
up in the last seven or eight
years," said Tom Crady, Vice
President for Student Ser-
vices.

Disability accommoda»
tion is a large concern within
Grinnell's administration,
“We've made huge strides in
the facilities area," said Os-
good. Some of the additions
to new buildings, such as elce
vators in the new dorms, have

February

been made to benefit those
with physical disabilities.
Osgood also said that there
has been a continued effort to
make the academic buildings
more compliant with the dies
ability policy at Grinnell.

Dew Rattanasangpunth
‘09, President of International
Student Organization, said he
believes diversity at Grinnell
is not a problem and the colt
lege rs very supportive ofmul-
ticultural and international
students. Rattanasangpunth
believes this new position will
improve the already diverse
atmosphere of the college.

“As a student of color On
campus, Frank Thomas is
who you would go to,“ said
Simmy Wimbush ’08, Presis
dent of Asian American Cos
alition. “it speaks a lot about
Grinnell that they realize they
need someone to ﬁll that per
sition,"

 

"Hugo Chavez is an agar
tistieal powershungry guy,
but people seem to love him
and Venezuela is doing well.
As long as he doesn’t do anys
thing terrible and kill people
along the way or take away
basic freedoms, it's [okay]."

“1 think [his negative rep-
utation] is justiﬁed a l‘ tlc bit
because there are leg mate
fears he might take away bus
sic freedoms. But part of it
is because there's still such a
stigma against socialism in
the United States

“I admire him for the fact
that he has the balls to stand
up to the U,S., which you
don‘t see other leaders doing.
But on the same note, some
of his policies can be viewed
as despotic, something that
would come out of a dictator.
I think he just kicked out
some us ofﬁcial or diplo-
mat from the country still,
there’s a lot of Hugo Chavez
that you don’t know about
because the us. media picks
and chooses what we know
about him and it's mostly
negative."

from P- 7 speciﬁc investment practices in order
to protect the work of its highly sought
after investment managers. “The college is fortunate to have
retained managers with outstanding investment records,” Clay
Said in a phone interview. “As Such, there is signiﬁcant market
interest in their investment activity."

“The college wants to be respectful of [our ﬁnancial mans
gets] and not disrupt their investment process so it has not disc
closed holdings. However, we do timely respond to requests
as to whether the college is directly invested in an identified
company," said Clay

Under this policy, Giwa and the others submitted a list of
potentially objectionable companies for Grinnell to identify
whether or not the school is invested in them.The names of the
companies the students asked about were not released to the
Smile! Cf Blank, but Giwa said the college's investments have
been generally acceptable thus far.

According to the students, they are continuing discussions

with the trustees, The two groups are scheduled to meet a sees
and time in late February. While the school maintains it will
not release a list of companies it invests in, the students hop‘e to
positively affect the investments in other ways, such as weighs
ing in on the college’s Votes at shareholder meetings.

Both the administration and students were positive about
theil communication. “We've had good open dialogue Consid—
ering how frequently they are on campus," Hall said. “i don’t
thinkthere are many instances anymore that we [and the trust-
ccs] don’t see eye to eye, because I think they look for ﬁnan-
cially and socially good investments" .

While the students are following a nationwide trend by gels
ting involved in the college’s investments, this is not first time
in the school's history students have taken action to prevent
Grinnell’s investment in questionable companies. In October
1988, students protested against the school investing in the Res
public of South Africa in‘ objection to the country’s program of
racial apartheid and successfully altered the school's policies.
