We Go’r |+---

A few weeks ago, this paper suggested the ’

possibility of having a mobile blood donor’s
outfit brought to this campus for the pur-
pose 1‘ receiving much needed blood for the
\var el’ rt. The Student Council, taking the
suggestion as being one worthy of consider-a7
tion, wrote letters of inquiry to various
agencies throughout the state. At first, the
replies seemed to indicate that the blood was
not needed, and that the cost of bringing a
unit here would not be worth the effort.
However, a week ago the council received a
letter stating that such a mobile unit will
be brought to this campus next month,

Already in this war, blood transfusions
have saved the lives of thousands of our
fighting men, and daily the usefulness of
transfusions for shock, excess bleeding, etc,
become more and more apparent. After blood
has been taken from an individual, it is
classified as to type, reduced to a plasma,
and kept in cold storage for shipment to
the various battlefields. This plasma, when
mixed with an equal portion of distilled
Water, becomes lifegiving blood to be in»
jected into the veins of our soldiers. The
value of transfusions in modern medical
warfare is surpassed only by that of the
new sulfa drugs.

Because the Red Cross is too busy
gathering blood in larger cities, the blood
collected in Grinnell will not go directly to

this organization. The blood collected here
will be for the purpose of relieving civilian
disaster primarily, but as the need for blood
becomes more and more pressing, this blood
will probably be requisitioned for Lise in
the aimed forces.

The task of arranging for a blood unit
on Grinnell campus is a project undertaken
by your Student Council, and as such must
be supported by you! The call has been made
for fifty students in good health who are
wi ing to donate a pint of their blood to a
worthy cause. Announcements as to the de—
tails of registration, etc, will be forthcom-
ing in this paper, but mean while, keep in
mind that here at last is the opportunity
you‘ve been waiting for to do your patriotic
duty and privilege.

They Did It Again--—
The roar of cannons or? the war fronts has
been heard on the Grinnell campus in many
ways. One outstanding one is the echo of
traditions falling to the floor. Grinnellians
threw another tradition out last Monday~
and threw it out with emphasis. Marilyn
McCool's election to the Student Council
presidencyﬁthe first time a woman has held
the job in Gi'innell'student government his-
tory shows one outstanding thing. Grinnell
women have awakened to the fact that they
are going to constitute, by far, the majority
of normally enrolled students on the campus
next year. They have made a reaction to
this bit of knowledge. With the help of men
who have known the fact for some time,
thev have elected a member of their group
gthe predominating one on campusito lead
them iii student government. Grinnellians
are to be complimented for their realistic
attitude. Many people thought that a man
would be elected because ”it was the thing
to do.” The thing to do was what the stue
dent body did do put in a person who will
represent the majority of the students. Dur»
ing peace time it is normal to let the men
run student affairs. That is fine too—they
should. We have lost what semblance of
“normalcy” we ever hadiwith it it is nae
tural for students to react as they did.
Miss McCool will be on a spot no other
member of her sex has ever occupied at
Grinnell. We hope she gets the wholeheart-
ed support of all the students; we know she
can get the job done; we wish her all the
luck she will need.
