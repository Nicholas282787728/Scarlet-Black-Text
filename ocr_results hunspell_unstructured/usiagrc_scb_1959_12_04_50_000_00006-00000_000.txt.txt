mess of all is the battle probe

If any city in the U.S thinks

should see Colombo at rush

with all this
driving becomes a real
sport as well as a battle for
survival. The Tighteofeway is
about the only rule which this
vers have to obey. The main
attitude is that the street is
one way, your way,
someone or something is com-
ing toward you, and then the
rule is to give liiln’ (or it)
enough room to pass. Traffic

‘ So when you approach a
roundabout, you look to the
right. and if nothing is coming,
you continue on around. Once
going around the round—about,
you always have the right-of-

ing to worry about. This sys~
tern seems to speed up the
flow or trattic unless you hap—
pen to be at the left of a
steady stream of vehicles and
then you just wait until they
all pass (this may take quite
a while).

But a roundabout is a fairly
tame element of the drivingl '
situation in Colombo. The main
problem is the ordinary street.
In the first place, the streets
are not too wide, and they seem
narrower since there are noi
sidewalks and the pedestrians-
walk along both sides. Add a,
few bicycles aiong the edges!
especially at rush hour when
they come out in full force To
this, add the automobiles whize
