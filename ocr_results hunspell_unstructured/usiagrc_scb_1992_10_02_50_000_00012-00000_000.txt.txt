Innovative Billy the Kid periormed next weekend

by Eleanor Dodson

The upcoming Grinnell College
Theater Department production of
B-Movies: Scenes from the Life of
Billy the Kid is a departure from
traditional drama. First ofall, there's
no written script. Second, there is no
speciﬁc plot. Cast member Mark
Anderson describes the production
as “a series of scenes trying to estab-
lish, make fun of or exaggerate the
legend of Billy the Kid."

In place of a written script, the
scenes are largely improvisational.
Some of the scenes have been ar-
ranged beforehand, while others are
worked out through improvisation,
Anne K. Gay, another memberof the
cast, pointed out that all the scenes
are thought up by the actors them-
selves.

In preparation for the play, the
cast watched movies about Billy the
Kid, includinglgft-Harlded Gun, Pat
Garrett and Billy the K iii. They also
read TheAnciehtChiId and The Com-
plete Works of Billy the Kid, pans of
which are used in the play. Anne K,
Gay said,“We didn'tnecessarilywant
to tell the life story of Billy the Kid,
but we had to work with the assump-
tion that the audience would know
very little about him, so a lot of his
personal history dm comethrough.”

Directed by Sandy Moffct, the
cast consists ofthirtecn people. Each
actor plays a different role for each
scene. There is no single actor por-
traying Billy the Kid. Instead, there
are several which Chan ge between
each scene. Even the stage sctrup
reﬂects the different approach this
production is offering. The audience
will beseated on rodeoblcachcrs that
sit on the stage itself. The set, which
has been described by set designer
Pip Gordon asa western junglegym,
is a mere skeleton of a typical west-
em setting and is adaptable for each
individual scene.

The production focuses more on
the legend of Billy the Kid than on
the man himself. Presented to the
audience are several contradictions
within the legend, including what
might have been the real motivations
for each character. It is a struggle
with the differentaspecLs ofthe Billy
the Kid story, which can be different
from any angle. Mark Anderson said,
“Scenesfrom the Life oth'Ily the Kid
is special because no matter what
really happened, the legend of Billy
the Kid is what each person thinks it
is." B-Mcvies: Scenes from the Life
ofBiIly the Kid will run next Thursr
day through Sunday, October 8-] i in
Roberts Theater.

Prestigious flutist, hamsichordist‘ to perform

by Amy Pletsch

World-famous flutist Jeffrey
Cohan and German harpsichordist
Hans-J iirgen Schnoor will perform a
program of Renaissance and baroque
music on Tuesday, October 6, at 8
pm. in Herrick Chapel.

The baroque and Renaissance
ﬂutes that Cohan will be playing are
exact copies of original instruments
from Belgium and Italy, made by
Rudolf Tutz of Innsbruck, Austria.
Theprimarydiffercnce between early
ﬂutes and their modern counterparts
is that the early models have a cylin-
drical bore. The modem examples
have a tapered head which accounts
for the differencein fingerings. “The
early ﬂutes create a soft, rich sound

that is edgier titan thatofthe modem
flute,“ says Cohan. Cohan also notes
that the Renaissance ﬂute is nearly a
whole tone flat, while the baroque
ﬂute is only a half tone ﬂat on the
modem scale.

Mr. Schooner will play
Grinnell’s copy of a French baroque
harpsichord made by William Dowtl.
Cohan comments that, “the harpsi-
chord has a very rich sound. When
tuned up to the modem scale the
sound is brighter, but not quite as
rich.“ For the program the harpsir
chord will be tuned halfway between
the Renaissance and baroque scales,
which will create a sound similar to
the music of both eras.

The program is divided with
Cohan playing the Renaissance ﬂute
