Willi Zeigler, Howell and Eppersoll,
all of whom won their “G” on the coir
loge team last year, the Seniors should
offer rather strong competition for
honors. Zeigler will be used at center
while Eppersou and Wells who have
played the guards (or three years will
probably be kept at this old position.
Rowell will play one forward while
Gill and Catly will probably alternate
at the otiier.

At dist glance the horrors have the
best material oi all the class teams.

this action will result in the abolish.

three or the members oi the body that
has had control of the state Meet were
members oi the Missouri Valley Cone

oi the dissenting vote of Gl'iuueli‘s'

The new rule will leave Griunell
