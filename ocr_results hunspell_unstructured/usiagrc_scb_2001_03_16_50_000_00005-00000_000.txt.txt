Excessive? Really?

I've seen hundreds or them in the last two days:
people cruising merrily around the College . . . Cars?
Man, that is something new. What, 1 ask youy do
Grinnell students need cars for? Are they drug smug-
glers or something? 1 mean, we're all stuck together
on this couple blocks of campus: grocery stores, res-
taurants, and banks are all within walking distances.
Wait a minute . . . did iiust see a bike? Goad lord,
and now cell phanes!

Bottom line is, we don't live in the stone Age
anymore Cell phones have cheaper long distances
rates and most importantly, are mobile. Frankly, no.
body needs the restraint to wait in his/her room by
the phone tora calla Haven't you ever missed an im
portant call while you're sitting on a toilet or out
doing something? So, why is cell phone the least bit
excessive?

Students speak
out about what's
on their minds in
142 words, and
you’re invited! If
you have a
random rant,
email it to
alward@grinnell_edu.
After all,
complainaing in a
public forum is
always more fun
than doing it

Bn‘ght, not bright

what is it about wearing bright colors and glittery

Visions of stimulating classroom discussions faila It’s
because the brightness or clothing is inversely related
to brightness in terms of intelligence. Therefore, by
