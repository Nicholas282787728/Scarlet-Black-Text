ZDINOSAUR DAYS
fYou’ve got the wrong one baby, uh huh!

The March Madness oflhoNCAA
. basketball tournament is over, but
‘ don'tdespair, Pepsi hasdccrced April

National Uh Huh Month. Just when I
‘ thoughtallwaslostzthatthecommcr-
i cial affair which we used to simply

call basketball was the worst it could
‘ be,Pcpsi assured me that thin gs could
get considerably more commercial.

The stars of Monday night‘s ﬁnal
’ game were nothing in the face ofRay
ACharIes and the glamorous “Uh Huh

girls." The Uh Huhjingle tang in my
‘ ears longer than the cries of coura-
t geous hero which Duke University’s

tecn heart-throb Christian Laettner
‘ inspired. They bad girls in short skins,
t while tthCAA’sonlypatheticsales
Itochnique was the three point shot,

dreamed up by men who wanted to
’ make the game just that much more
‘ exciting.

The three point shot is fake. Fake,
' fake, fake. So what ifa six pointlead
gcan now be cut in half with a well-

aimed ball? A seven point lead with
‘ less than two minutes remaining is no
, longera surething. Nodoubt, the rule
adds a little excitement. But is it fair
‘ sport? It's almost as bad as the artifi-
tcially perfect bodies of the Uh Huh
girls.

How would a typical Grinnell stu-
dent feel if he/she had worked dili-
. gently all semester, studied hard for

the ﬁnal exam, and went into the test
'to discover that the professor had

lions which were each worth one and
ahalftimes the regular questions,and
furthermore, thatonly some students
had the ability to answer. Those SluA
dents would automatically earn more
paints than Joe/Joanna Hardwork. In
one fell swoop, these lucky dogs
would knock their GPA’s into fourth
floor Burling range. Fair? I think not.

Before you become too indignant,
try this one on for size: Christian
Laettner, allrtime high scorer in the
NCAA, was declared a “brave and
courageous" athlete by sportscasters
Monday night. Laeltner, whose
moussedlightbrownlocksandclean-
cut features have prompted hundreds
of love letters (of the girls who write
daily asking to marry the basketball
star, Laettner says, ”The best] can do
is send them an autograph every few
weeks or so"), was not playing well
during the first halfof the final game
against Michigan. He was not only
missing his shots, but standing ﬂat-
footed as they hit the backboard. He
was responsible for no less than 7
turnovers.

In the second half, however,
Iaettner picked himself up and hit
fourteen points with no nimovers,
thus earning great praise from the

sportscaster. The suggestion that
Lacttncr was courageous is nearly as
ridiculous as the scenario that Ray
Charles might be interrogated for the
secret ingredient in Diet Pepsi. His
coach leaned on him, hard. Courage?
Firemen who run into burning build-
ings are courageous. Lacttner is no
superhero. He's just a great basket-
ball playerwhohad a bad firsthalfbul
came through for his team in the sec-
ond.

Just like Lacttner, the Uh huh
chickscatnethrough forRay.Ithought
(hoped) that he was going down in
that clever advertisement which fea-
tures a panel of overweight white
men and three demurely drﬁsed girls
who strip down lead the entire room
into a celebration of song and dance.
At tltc end of the commercial, Ray
practically burrows his nose in one of
the girl’s breasts. Then there‘s the ad
in which all three skimpily dressed
girl: show up waving their arms (se-
ductively?) every time any man pops
open a can of Diet Pepsi. Who‘s the
genius behind this creativity?

I only hope that he isn‘thired as a

‘ imageamaker for the NCAA. We al-

ready havc the larger—than-life ath-
letic gods, the three-point shot which
produces applause like canned laugh-
ter, and the official’s timeouts dur-
ing which commercials are shown.
What happened to just watchirtg a
game?

1"Do not blame the Victim for
the perpetrator's crime”

Every year patrons of prospective
students ask Grinnell Collegeadmin-
'Istrators questions about campus life.

Theparenlsareparticularlyconccmed
‘rtbOutdrugs,alcohol and safety in the
_Grinnell community. Last Friday at

one function, a father asked a Grinr
>nell College administrator about as

‘saulls. She answered, “You have to

be smart. Ifyou walk through town at

‘3arn, you’re asking for it."

Immediately following this con—

versation, Ellen expressed her anger
'conceming the administrator’s state-
.ment to an Admissions counselor.

The counselor, however, saw no disA
‘tinction between saying it is more

Ellen McCallie
and
Sara Tabbert

dangerous to walk around at 3am and
saying one is “asking for trouble” by
doing so.

The word choice here is not merely
an issue of semantics, but of percep-
tion. These perceptions determine
who is guilty, who is blamed. Is a
woman wearingashortskirt“asking"
to be raped? Is a man walking past the
bar at night “asking” to be beaten up?

Thisimpliesthatthevictimsarebring-
ing the violence upon themselves.
We cannot more strongly disagree.
Do not blame the victim for the
perpetrator's crime. It is no wonder
that students are reluctant to use offi»
cial channels to address harassment
and assaults.

Women Take Back the Night re-
minds us thatwe all should bcahle to
go anywhere safely at any time. As
this is not the case, even in Grinnell,
one must weigh the risks and possible
disadvantagesofnottaking thescrisks
and make one’s own decisions. The
result of this should never be inter—
preted as “asking for it."

The toughest job you’ll ever ...?

SCRATCHINGS OF A

MAD

MAN

America the pitiful

Yesterday I was reading the work
ofan expatriatejoumalist who talked
ofa survey that found that American
high school and college students
“were as stupid as pig dribble". I then
thoughtabout it forawhile, and real-
ized that even here at Grinnell that
remark has some basis. A shocking
number of people have no concept of
what the European Community is, or
they can't place New Zeaiand on a
map. More pertinently, writing skills
are poorly developed and abilities in
foreign language are tragically lack—
ing. ‘Stupid’ is a bit harsh,but ‘ignoV
rant’ is not. A large proportion of
people who come here are preco-
ciously talented, but almost no one
has been done justice by their high
school. Then, just when you reach
your senior year of college and you
thinkyouareaboultoeonquerEvcrest,
you realize that you have to go to
graduate school to get that career
you’ve been drooling over for years.
Or, you don’t even know what you
want to do.

The root of the problem lies in the
abysmal excuse for a high- school
educationsystemthatweighsAmerica
downltl<eamillstonearoundtheneck.
Students come out of high school
around two years behind their Euro-
pean and Japanese counter-pans in
most skills. In some respects they are
even worse off. Geometry and trigo-
nometry are taught in most English
school districts by the 7th grade. In
Iowa, considered to have one of the
best high school systems in America,
many 10th gtaders have not yet taken
such courses. While Europeans are
sweating away over A»Ievels, Bacca-
laureateorAbilurcxaminations,their
high school senior counterparts in
Americaaretaking civicscourses that
don't teach them basic principles of
the US Constitution, home econom-
ics courses thatdon’tteach them how
to cook and foreign language courses
that don’t teach them how to speak.
They are compounding the deﬁcien-
cies of their earlier education by tak—
ing courses that are worthless and
usually blown off.

The result is that America must
pour billions of dollars into a college
system that can often do little more
than repair past damage. Even highly
selective colleges like Grinnell have
to put their students through intro»
ducrory courses to reach the college
level for which they ought to be pre-
pared out of high school. Many pro-
fessional degrees, such as law, medi-
cine and MBA qualifications, are
available only at the postgraduate level
in America, because few American
undergraduates can handle such dcr
grces.Graduatoinstitutionsare burst
ing at the seams and adding places
every year,costinglheirstudentsmil-
llonsitt luiLionandlostsalarics,while
myopic politiciansand cducatorsconr
tniue to neglect the school system
that made more higltercdltcatton nee

essary in the ﬁrst place.

Such problems are compounded
by petty local squabbles over the con
trol of education, parean who protest
to teachers when their offspring are
‘excessively’ challenged by an as
signmcnt and a clearly skewed sense
ofprion'ties. Permian HighSchooHn
Odessa, Texas, boasts a new (1982)
20,000 seat football stadium with ar-
tificial turf and Headlights, a football
coach making well over $50,000 a
year, a student body largely from
securely middle class backgrounds -

and average cumulative SAT scores
languishing in the subacademic 800‘s.
There are other such examples all
over the country. Parean beara large
degree of responsibility. If they aren’t
defending theirkids from homework,
they‘re supporting schemes to buy
new lights forthe football ﬁelds, while
their nearestand dearesthave to share
tattyout—of—datetexlbooksindteclass«
room because the school can‘t afford
to buy new ones. Meanwhilebemused
foreign exchange students come to
American high schools and wonder
why they are reviewing something
they covered two years before. As for
the school boards, they resist sensible
ideas like offer-ingexua com jointly
with other districts because of petty
jealousics and refuse to beef up the
cun-iculum because students (often
bored stiff by what they do now) are
allegedly Incapable ofdisseminating
anything that is more interesting.

The biggest problem is the local—
imtion of the American educational
system. Apart from the ACT, the sub
ject—bzmed college entrance test, no
meaningful national measure of stu-
dent talent exists (the SAT, by con-
trast, is little more than a skewed
aptitude test, and fails completely to
measure students' abilities in applied
subjects). Even the Act“ is notenough
- it merely tests basic knowledge in
very general terms The Federal Gov~
emment must demand that the states
meet Various national standards of
course unis taken bystudents. Itmust
do so by setting up a core curriculum
that is designed to meet the needs and
interests of students. Such a curricu~
lum wouldbcdcvised byschooltcach-
ers, college professors and
businesspeople aware of skills that
they need. If appointed on a non»
partisan anrlnon-regional basis,these
people could produce a system that
would rise above the ridiculous
squabblcs about local autonomy and
prayer in the schools that dominate
the debate on education today. And
the latitude for locals to spend money
on new Iloodlights at the expense of
new books would be drastically re-
duced.
