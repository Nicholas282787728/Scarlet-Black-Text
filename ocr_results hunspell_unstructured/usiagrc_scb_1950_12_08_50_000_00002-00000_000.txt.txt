WSSF Means Preservation

Every faculty member who gilies his $ contribution
to the world student service fund drive will be paying for

a foreign university’s library, ;

We'd like to give an example of what each student’s
cc lcl buy. But WSSF funds must cover items too big to?
c. le them down to that level. When you stop to considerl
t".it it takes over $1500 to maintain a single student hostel,
il (lldia, of which there are many, you can see hon far
00,000 will go, Tllat is this year's budget figure for the‘
SF,

The drive on this campus is for $2 from each student,
$5 ll'om each facility member. It was timed to come when
.sti dents would be likely to have extra money, perhaps even

'ttle extra spirit of giving. Whether or not it was timed.

t, by looking over the scope of its activities, students

i see that theil money is sorely needed. It will be spentl

' items necessary to student welfare and existence. l
In Indonesia, Pakistan, Greece, Burma, Italy, Germany

Many students have wondered what their dollars will:

e; will go to Southeast Asia, onerfourth to Europe, and}

ore-fourth to China. The other 2.5% is divided among al
number of administrative progTams.

If your schooling depended upon gifts from the wealtlr

nation ill the world, you would hold such aid invaluable.
