REFORM NEEDED

While abandonmpnt of “hell week” in any
form appears unjustified in face of the response
of the first year men to questionaire
circulated Tuesday, there seems to be
very definite cause for illstigating some manner
of reform in present prepping methods and for
modifying the existing probation program.

Although the reaction of the freshmen points
to this need, it does not emphasize sufficiently
the very real necessity for some sort of action.
The men who were not directly involved in one
of the cases of “ovenprepping” were a little too
inclined to ignore the problem which these ex—
ceptions, though comparatively few in‘number,
have brought up. When a ireshman’s health is
actually endangered by pitiless beatings, or even
when preps are dealt numerous—if not dangerous,
blows for no other reason than to amuse an up-
perclassman, there Is something drastically wrong
with the system.

When 50 per cent of the freshmen express
disapproval with the use of paddling during “hell
week this certainly should be sufficient portion
to calry some weight" I~Furthermore, since a
similar percentage of the ﬁrst year men assert
that, in at least one phase, the “hell week" activ.
ities were carried to an extreme, the advisability
of continuing the probation period as recently
Conducted is surely open to question. And fin—
ally, when 56 per cent of the responses express
the belief that “ ‘hell week’ should be changed in
spirit and method”, the suggestion certainly is
worthy of consideration.

A number of needed changes In the probation
program are suggested by examination of the
questionairband by review of the few cases
of “over prepping.”

First, and most urgent of all, is that paddling
should be banned, All attempts to assure limited
paddling have proved futile. This fall, the-Coun—
cil of House Presidents ordered that paddling
should be employed only as punishment, in none
but extreme cases, and should be administered by
the house council. In at least two halls, this rul-
ing was completely ignored, and in the others it
was by no means strictly observed Apparently
the only way in which the few serious cases of
paddling each ”hell week” can be prevented is
to outlaw the paddle completely.

That paddling is not a problem peculiar to
Grinnell is proved by the exchange editorial from
the Daily Illini in this issue. Paddling serves no
genuine purpose and is, we earnestly believe, an
obsolete custom which has outgrown its useful—
mess—if it ever possessed any. There is nothing

to lose and much to gain by outlawing this prac-
tice on the Glinnell campus

G
MERRILL DEBATE

There has arisen considerable misunderstand-

ing, recently, about the purpose of the Merrill
debates.

The trust fund which the money lor the prizes
is drawn was established by G. W. Merrill in 1911.
He established this fund [or the promotion of inter-
est in practical politics; which, according to his
idea, dealt with the actual handling of the current

situations. In order to completely carry out
the provisions of the endowment it was necessary
to eliminate as far as possible the extensive read-
ing involved in the usual debate. Specifically,
he wished to make the debate as nearly extcm—
poraneous as possible, thus causing the debaters
to use their brains rather than their skill in hunt-
ing up statistics.

In recent years the terms of the grant have
not been fully carried out. Little by little the
debates slipped away from the founder’s idea un»
til they were considered as being apart of the
intramural system. Not only did the debates
become involved in the intramural program, but
they also lost their fornler non»theoretical char-
acter and became more and more like usual the
academic debates as the result of choosing ques—
tions little related to practical politics.

This year, however, an attempt has been made
to return the debates to the original conception
of them as the founder had specified. The pre»
sent misunderstanding resulted.

In the past the terms of the endowment have
plainly not been Carried out. It is only right
that a return to the original plan should be under-
taken,

I Other Opinions

PADDLE DICTATORS
(The Daily lilini)

uIIIversIty men used to pride themselves on being
“collegiate," wearing wide-bottom pants, and hazing the
freshmen. Today these things ”just aren't being done."
However, there still remains a large group of “Joe Col-
lege" fraternity men who pride themselves on their abIl.

Ity to break a paddle on a neophyte who has “assumed
the position."

Some of these sophIstIcated indivdiuals really believe
that they are InstIlling the desired qualities of loyalty and
respect In the freshmen pledges by wielding the “chas.
tlsement board." The indIvIduaIs who maintain this
naive belief arc unfoItunatoly the members of the tra—
temty who lack the ability to command respect from any.
onc, ochI the lowly frosh. They are not respected by
their own fraternity brothers who have known them
for several years. The paddle-wielders are quite aware
of this fact and seek to obtain the next best thing, a
superficial respect maintained by the pledge who is cow-
cd by the threat of a paddle,

These “Joe College” boys suspect that the pledges
voice their real opinions among the other neophytcs and
as a result they raise the paddle whenever they fear that
the pledge is showing any tendency that reveals his real
thoughts.

It is dilfioult to determine what any honest fraternity
man expecb to achieve in peI-mItting puny dictators to
Continue these practices. They may be proceeding on
the theory that every freshman needs a certain amount
of paddllng to get into "the spirit of the thing.” They
may think that because they suffered during their pledeg.
ship that it is their duty to carry on the tradition.

If these same Individuals would pondervlong enough
to remember their own pledge days they‘wuuld recall
that paddling dId not increase their respect, friendship,
or loyalty to their fraternity brothers. It did instill a
sullen respect which concealed a_ real and lasting hate
for some individual who “carried it a little too far."

Then there is another group of individuals who be.
lieve mat they are helping the Ireshman adjust himself
and that the only means of discipline available to carry
out this work lies in the paddle. These Individuals be.
lieve that the common denominator to all freshman prob.
lems hes in the “chastisement board.” Even the most
elementary knowledge of psychology will warn anyone
that all pledges do not have the same temperaments. The
sclf.suffIcient student who has had some experience in
handling his ovm problems will resent high school tactics
such as paddling. The bewildered students who is find.
ing it 'difficult to adjust himself to his new surroundings
will be further confused if he is punished without merit—
ing it.

By this time ”Joe College" will be protesting that dis-
cipline Cannot be maintained without paddling, Perhaps
in fraternities where the upperclassmen are really weak
individuals it will be impossible [or them to maintain
respect any other way. In cases such as this there Is
little to offer. lf'pledg‘es have to live in this kind of
environment they Won’t amount to anything anyway. It
is unfortunate that they pledged such a fraternity and if
they are real men they will break their pledge before it
is too late.

Whether or not force Is used pledges will imitate the
older members of the house. The neophyte sees each
active member of thc fratcmity as a BMOC and it the
active members conduct themselves in the right manner
he results will be seen In a real pledge Class.

And the last bit of advice to the pledge is this: Don’t
be afraid to protest paddling because you are afraid of
being called “yellow.” Coach Bob Zuppke who knows
courage when he Sees it, is strongly opposed to fraternity

paddling, and so is every intelligent individual on this
campus,

The Book Nook

We live in a time which requires
a good deal of reading if one hopes
to keep abreast of things, If that
reading is selective yet comprehen.
sivc, it is not quite so difﬁcult a task
to keep one’s footing and to gain a
more or less detached perspective on
the contemporary scene. The rental
shelf contains a number of the books
whose popular reception is indicative
of their ability to meet the desires
of present-day readers. Your con.
tinued patronage will serve to make
the collection more complete.

THE NEW DEALERS, by the Un—
official Observer,

This is a volume that will go a
long way toward satisfying the natural
curiosity we all have about the men
who are shaping the history of our
country. It is filled with information
and contains onough gossip to give it
seasoning. The Observer would seem
from the uneveness and sporadic qual—
ity of the writing to be the collabora.
tion of a group of newspaper men.
Many Important things are treated
quite superficially and the authors may
not succeed in infecting you with
their pro-Rooseveltian enthusiam and
conviction, but they certainly will en—
tertain. It is a good description of a

magn'ﬁcent show,

GOOD-BYE, MR. CHIPS, by James
Hilton.

This is the kind of story and Mr.
Chips the type of characmr that only
the England of our literary imagina—
tion could produce It is really only
a long short story, yet there is flavor
about it which defies description and
which most longer stories tail to
create. To Mr. chipping, lovable and
memorable teacher at the Brooklield
School, life was written in terms of
the boys who sat at his feet and
then went out to build an empire. A
recital of the basic facts of this book
would be trite but there is inherent in
the very character of the material
that Indefinable appeal which needs
no plot to hold its reader enthralled.

FAMOUS STORIES OF FIVE CENT.
URIES., edited by Hugh Walpole and
W. Partington.

There is undoubtedly an appetite
for a certain type of story created by
confining one’s reading to magazine
swries. For the people who have
this rather specialized taste, Messers.
Walpole and Partlngton have
compiled a sturdy vblumebe stories
which are, in the main, excerpts from
longer works. The book will be
worth its weight in gold if it suc—
ceeds in demonstrating that the char-
acter of the fiction in the ominously
thick and discuuragingly respected
works of these authors is not dry as
dust and wearingly descriptive but is,
surprisingly enough, vividly and inter.
estingly written. At any rate this
book is an opportunity to sample any
number of authors without committ.
log yourself to an entire work.

Men Rate Baby Talk
‘Extreme Annoyance’

Los ANGELES, Calif. (ACP)—lt’s
the “little things in life" that are most
apt to get in ones hair and under
ones skin if results of an experiment
conducted recently by a psyscbology
student at Los Angclos Junior college
prove anything, for in a list of “an.
noyances" checked» by a number of
subjects, details such as earthquakes
and tornadoes were completely ignor.
cd.

In carrying out the experiment, lists
of 10 annoyances were made by the
subjects, and these “pet.peeves" were
in turn Compiled into complete lists
to be marked as either extremely,
moderately, or slightly annoying, not
annoying at all, or a situation that
has never been met.

Men agree that back seat driving
Is extremely annoying, but listening
to baby talk Is considered the Worst
possible annoyance. Loud girls, ex.
cess use of makeup, and bitten fin.
goI-nalis also bother men.

Uncleanliness annoys women most
of all, and quarrelsome people arc
next in line. Co—eds evidently do ,r
like conceited people, as “people who
know it all" and braggarts were high
In percentage among the “peeves”.
College men should know that when
they keep their “dates" waiting, they
are aggravating them to the uttermost
degree,
