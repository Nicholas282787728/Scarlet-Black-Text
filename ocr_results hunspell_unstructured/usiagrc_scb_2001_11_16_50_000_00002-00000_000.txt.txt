at the same time as student initiatives.

The first ehange would remove the stipulation that students

year, then—Proldent sean Flammcr '02 waned the eligibility re.
quiremenr so that paul Ford ’02 eould serve as a senator despite
being on amdemie probation, that aetion beeame an issue during
Ford’s eandidaey tot SGA ptesident, and Joint Board voted to
suspend the eonstinition again.

Under the proposed ehanges, eandrdates would be asked to
diselose whether they were on any kind or probation, but would
not be automanoilly ineligible.

Paul Arms ’02 Games), who voted against the ehange, said his
eonstituenrs felt irwas “unfair for a person who is on atademie
probation or probation for miseonduer to hold these omtes." Ale
thouyrsevnalsenatois hadeirptessedsimilareoneernsatlastrveek's
meeting tlae proposal passed by a wide margin,

senators unanimously approved three ehanges: removing the
requirement that Joint Board meetings be held on Wednesdays,
giving the viee president the yob otsehedriling student eirnieu.
him eonrmirree meetings. and requiring that standing eonrrnirtee
members be inrroduoed to Joint Board upon request by either the
SGA president or three members orloinr hoard.

One proposed ehange was defeated and will not appear on
the ballot next week. it would have required a trvo.thrrds major.
ity in Joint board to overturn any deeision made by a standing
eommittee. Supporters agreed with Administrarrve Coordinator
Alejandro Oyaxubal '04 that committee members were “more
capable of making a decision" daan loinr Board.

Opponeno, likeDan Iakorvin '02 (Loose), argued that mak.
ing it harder for Joint Bond to overrule eommittees worrld be
“taking power away t'tom Grinnell students in the hrnire."

Aaron Wright ’02 (Read) tale that the measure would “pm-
venr mieromanaging whieh hampers the runetioning orstudenr

Although Jaeob Kaufmaneoﬂmm '04 (corvles) urged sena.
rots to vote for the drange regardless of their position so that
students eould vote on it direerly. it failed by a slim margin.
