And So '30' - -

Tonight is the last night in the S & 8 office.
The last night for any members of the class
of 1944. There are just two of us left of
that bunch of 16 freshman rookies who used
to jump when Bronk Kuhl cracked the edi-
torial whip. It is a night that lends itself
to memories.

Theoretically at least, the editolial cola
umiis of this, as of any paper, should be
reserved for comments of broad, general ina
terest, concisely reported and incisively an~
alyzed. But not tonight. Tonight we are
going to let fundamentals of journalism go
hang on the hook and we are going to wax
sentimental as a serenade. We warn you,
in case you have no feelings toward the class
of 1944, Go read Walter Lippmann for pol-
itics tonight 7 We’ve got a date with 14
other guys who can’t meet this deadline.

There are really more than 14 people we
miss tonight — this isn't the final will and
testament of the S & B staff but of the class
of ’44' yet, surrounded by the Major’s famA
ous cilcular desk, and looking at the scores
of initials of former staff members which
are gouged into its surface, we keep think-
ing of the people who might be here to help
us put this last issue to bed, to help us
write the last big ‘30' that puts finis on a
news story and a college career.

It‘s been a kind of mixedeup college ca-
reer.

War classes have one advantage over
those of more normal years; their members
a official graduates and ex‘s —— leave col—
lege with a sense of maturity which is de-
nied to others, We aren't quite the untried
youth of an ordinary era. Those who have
had to leave us prematurely have gone out
to a big, dirty, and wonderful job. Their
record in it is their justification for ha'ving
lived; and our inspiration for beginning to
work. Tonight, under all the nostalgia, the
reminiscing and the homesickness for a
place we have not yet left, there is a serious-
ness of purpose and of ambition that we
don’t think would have been there ill 1939
or 1882,
in a couple of years

And yet for all the divul'gencies of war
e for all the scattered whereabouts of peo-
ple .who should be marching into chapel with
us Sunday, we feel that the war class of ’44
has a greater measure of true unity than we
would have had another time. When some-
thing you prize is challenged, when you fear
losing it, it suddenly becomes doubly prec-
ious, So with class spirit now; so even with
attachment to and reverence for this, our

It's Up to You - -

Long before one school year terminates,
plans are being laid for a new one. Gradu—
ation from College is the beginning of new
and larger opportunities for those who have
completed their college course. It may be
the end of youthful freedom to sleep late in
the morning, to choose whether one will
keep the day‘s schedule or not. ,It may mean
the loss of economic security and depend-
ence upon the family for support, but it
also represents the beginning of a stniggle
for existence iii which success will depend
upon the amount of discipline one has aw
quired and the wisdom with which the
knowledge gained in College is put to use.

As far as the College is concerned we may
expect that the coming year will make
greater demands on the wisdom and the
adaptability of administration, faculty, and
students than in any year ill the recent past.
Yet we have every reason to be optimistic
about our ability to meet with satisfaction
and profit every demand that the
ahead may make upon us, We are planning
the educational program of the College so
that it will offer greater opportunity for iii-i
tellectual development on the part of both
students and faculty than will be found inl
many similar institutions. The ratio be-
tween teachers and students will be approx-*—
imately one faculty member for every six
students. This should make it possible fol
an even closer personal relationship to exist
between them, and for a warmer and mole
intimate experience of intellectual fellowship
than is normally the lot of students and
faculty in American institutions of highel
learning. The opportunity will exist. It
will be up to the students and the faculty
to make the most of it With the help of
student-faculty committees extensive plans
are being made for the adjustment of cm
social and esthetic programs in order that
these activities may compensate to some
extent at least for the smaller student
body, and particularly for the loss in male
students.
