When asked why this particular plus

because it was “dark Willtoul being

Future plans for the band are not
deﬁnite at thcmoment, Although sev-
eral offers have been made to them.
Knssover said he has learned that
“people promise a lot or things, but a
promise is not the truth."

Lanny Bucket alrcady has a new
nlbulti'sworlh ofsongs and is continu-
ing to practice and play on weekends.
Their weekend commutes to Chicago
have begun again. Parks explained
that they have tried to keep their work—
load light and getting out of Grinnell
does them good.

“I get this festering feeling when
I’m here," said Parks,

Beyond those plans, all he could
say is that he wants to “spend my 30‘s in
New Orleans and die in Montana."

Correction:
Two mistakes were made in last
week‘s On the Cutting Edge article
aboutlocztl bandMujo Machine. The
name ofthe lead bassist for the band
isCtaig Metz, not Craig Bass. Also,
the quote “It keeps on kicking,"
which was attributed to drummer Jo
Sutton was actually spoken by Alan
Hanley. The Scarlet& Black apoloe
gizes for any inconvenience these
mistakes may have caused.

ON THE CUTTING moi: ‘
GETTWG TO KNOW CAM’US BANDS

Experience, motivation

key

to band Maelstrom’s success

By SARAH STAVETEIG

Arts & Entertainment Editor
AELSTROM’S fonnulafor

success is pretty simple:

start with four musrcally-
experienced members motivated by
the desire to be a strong band, have
them practicetortourhourseachweek,
add some song writing and then let
them rock for ﬁve months,

This formula has worked wonders
forsophomore bandMaeIrtrom. Evenas
a young group, they won lastsemester's
Battle aft/12 Bantir. And they headlined
at a Han-ls conceit last Saturday. They
have even played at Gardener twice and
will be recording a tape in the future.

It seems like this would be all it
campus band would want,buIMaelrtmm
has lots of plans for the future.

-Tetl mchowyou came nboutwinning
Battle ofllle Bands.

Jeremy Boley ~We’re a pretty young
band,weallliketoplayalol. Weworked
up one songforBattle af/IicBaans about
a week before the Show,

JamesRechs eWe had two songs wehad
played twtce before.

Marc Janssen -Wc play a good 80%
original music, Forsolnereason,we got
the reputationasbcingztcoverband. But
we just play a few covers, that‘s it
Jan-its elee this last time [Feb 11] at
Ham's, we played thirteen songs: trinc
onginals and tour covers.

-What did it feel like to win Battle of
the Bands?

Jeremy -Well, I didn't expect it.
Adam Kempenaar-l think we were all
alittIe confidentztctually,.. [hate to say it
James -Its not that we felt there was no
competition, but we felt we had really
worked hard.

Adam -We had good turnouts at our

shows, and everyone seemed to like us.
Jeremy eWc played Battle or the Bands
andwon, Ilwas ourgoal,and weachieved
it,

-Howdoessongwdtingwork between
the four or you?

Marc - Usually for some reason in my
room I’ll be playing something and [an
idea] will hit me in the head. I come in
and show these guys the guitar pans.
Sometimes I’ll show the guitar pan and
some lynes. That's one thing about the
bandilguesslwnlelhe majority of the
music. Everyone, ofcourse, contributes.
The anangcmenls are what make it the
song and the amngelncnls are done by
[the entire] band.

-VVhatare some ofthc (harms of your
lyrics?

Marc erien I write songs, I look at the
lyrics assort of a necessaryevil to getting
the music across. I look at the voice as
just another instrument. I usually try to
write the simplest stuff 1 can write, so it
usually ends up being about girls or
relationships. lshouldn'tsay that on this
campus, We have one song about cars
becausel'm from asmall town and I like
that,

Adam eWc get into some deeper stuff.

Marc rOne of the songs I wrote actually
means something, but other than that
-Now that you‘ve achieved your goal
(winning Battle of the Bands), what
next?

Jams »Its time tomove on to biggerand
better things,

Adam eWe want to be recognized, re
ally, as one otthe top bands on campus,
Whenever someone says Maelstrom
someone else says ‘Yeah. they’re good.‘
James rWe don‘t want to be the best
