ago, I Wrote that this was no time
for rhetoric. Soinc Concerted. Ins
telllgent ellort had to bc made in
order to have any eitect on your-
decismn. The student ellurt has
been concerted; it is clear where
we stand. For the most part. it has
been intelligent. Yes. we sip into
rhetoric, as people do when they
are intensely involved and highly
upset over an issue, But by and
large, the student body has simply

It has been met by a brick all.

i. We have to cut expenditures
Agreed. But why weren't student:
consulted" Look very carelully at
that word, Mr, Presulent. it does
not mean that students have the
iinal say, or even a votewnly that
their opinions were sought and
respected as a legitimate part oi
the community.

2, There will be a greater el~
iiciency in services and more
accountability in performance.
One question, why isn't this
possible under the present system?

3. This is part ot a larger plan to
live within our economic
limitations Yet again. why were
not the students consulted?
What has been done is indicative of

Given the student response to this

probably some more popular
alternatives. perhaps one that
could save as much money

All at which is to say. President

also how it was done Any and all
talk about a “pttlis. a “joytul

Openness needs to be combined

The degree oi openness can in
