New Orleans ditty, “Airizay,” is attracting

lots of fans. If you ask Ray about it, he Says:
"I've iound irorn long experience what style of
muslc we do bestsjust as I‘ve learned from

my ‘T-Zone‘ to a “1‘!”

Try Camels! Learn for yourself why, with
smokers who have tried and compared,
Camels are the “choice of experience.”
