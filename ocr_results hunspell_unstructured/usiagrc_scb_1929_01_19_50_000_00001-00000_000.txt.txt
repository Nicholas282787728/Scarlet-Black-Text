UNUSUAL ABILITY
SHOWN IN PLAYS

Two snort rroduetiorrs Are staged ior-
Pluy Production Clnssos.

The two plays presented by the
classes in Play Production on Wed
uesday were among the most diiiicult
attempted by student direction.
"Rocking Chairs" directed by Eleanor
Dunton was unusual in that the lines
were spoken in rhythm with the
movement or the rocking chairs.
Change in the tempo made necessary
a iincsse in interpretation not usually
round in’ student productions. The
second play, “Will 0‘ the Wisp." or
which Arthur Risser was tlredircctor.
is,a play chieilygoi mood. Some very
excellent character work was done in
this play and the lighting was unus-
ually good.

There is no doubt but that t:.esc
plays will be two or the three to be
piiblically produced next semester.
"Triiles" by Susan Glaspell, which
was gi on several weeks ago would
be in line ior another appearance, had
it not already been put heiore an
audience. For that reason some oili»
er play that has been given lreiore
the production classes only will prob-
ably be chosen ior a second produc-
tion.

Attcr weeks or insistent and
meticulous scouting and unearthing,
a SCARLET AND BLACK reporter

the full details oi a icariul escapade

O‘Donnell Gebert and King play
guards while O'Donnell is a ior-ward

There is much optimism in the Pio-
ner camp as to the outcome or the
battle because of the good showing
Griimell has made against members
at the Mid-West conierence, many or
which are on Marquette's schedule.
While Marquette has not made an)
outstanding showing thus iar, it s
an even chance that tilcy will play
the hardest against a Missouri \‘nl-
ley opponent.

in the Carleton game Thursday night,
Macy, Fail and Douglas have all look
ed as good basket shooters in the last

contribute a number oi points to the
Pioneer score Monday night. Cogger

mer-.years and can be counted on
to throw iear into the remaining
teams on the Gl'innell schedule. “('og-
gie" scored twelve points against the

iloor work in the past week and can
be counted on to contribute to the

After losing the last two games to
Drake and Creighton, tlics Pioneer
basketball team demonstrated it real

comeback Thursday night arid deioat- ‘

ed iﬁ-leton college, the pride oi the
Mid-West conierence, in 1 spectacular
game 27 to 25. Ha Ceggeshall
came into his own last night by lead-
ing his mates to victory in the second
halt. aitei- overcoming a lead at halt
time oi ll to 7.

Gi-innell swept the Chris oii their
icet iii the opening moments oi play.
A smooth working oiiense, a quickly
formed dol'cnse, and a few well placed
piled up a lead et 11 to 7 when the
five minutes. Carleton rallied quickly
to take the oiiensive and quickly ow
ercaine their handicap or‘ o to l and
baskets told the story ior the iirst
hali ended, Crawiord and Peri-in,
with the aid or Carrescli, caused this
momentary discontioi-t ior the Pio-
neers.

The Pioneers came back strong in
the second hali, however. and with
ten minutes to play held a 1.9 to 15
lead. Two minutes later the visitors
had tied up the score at 20—1“ and
with six minutes to play held a 24
to 20 lead, Ninety seconds later Grin—
nell had again knotted the count at
24 to 2d and coggeshall's iroe toss
and ingranr's basket gave the home
team a three point lead. With a hali
minute to go perrin shot a iield goal
but tailed to'ﬁe the score.

The"losiiig quintet, had they been
adept irom the 17-ioot line, lnight/
have turned the tables ior, oi ll giit

the Grinnellians dropped iii three
shots in eight attempts. .

Coggeshall took allhonors in the
contest with an individual scoring
record oi 12 points'dll chalked up in
the last hali. Fail, Macy and Douglas
all played crack games at guards.

in dribbling oi the first rial-lied seem- .

ing taster than ever betore, Macy
surprised the ians'in the' early part
oi the game when be twice worked
in under the basket tor short shots
which he made good and Douglas
scored a pair oi tairly long shots to
add to his etioi-t on the oiiensive,

iii-awiord, the. huge B toot 6 inch
center with the Carleton teain failed
to iuuction as well as was expected
and l—iumphrey urauaged to get his
share oi the tip-otis in spite oi the

in the contest.
