In llle strvsS of pi sentrday needs,

servioc. The May Pageant, ouc of the
most bealltilul and popular al’tni oi
thc year, has been given up thl )ring
and, piobubly. until the circumstances

It wa only after careful thought
that Ml. Andersen decided upon tiis

“but this _cnr 1 don't think it would
be light to \ c the time of so many
people thht nay when they might do
so much war work."

Quadrangle Girls in
Favor of More Dances

The fact that there is .1 strong desire
on the part of the girls [or more danc—
ing in the social life at Grinncll wits
made clear tin-u a census taken lzlst
weal: in two of the representative cots
tages of the Quadrangle.

Only s'v girls out of the two cottages
did not w it more dances. The other
members ideas, are varied as to tlic
number and type oi dances, hot the
ninja ity [ui‘Oi-etl the Knox plan of at
least one allreollhge dance every
month and a few smaller dancing par-
tics (luring the year.
