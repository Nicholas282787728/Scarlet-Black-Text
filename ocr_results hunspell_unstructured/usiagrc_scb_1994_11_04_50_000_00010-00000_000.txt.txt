LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Response to Allison Birch

The extent to which Grinncll
students reflexively support the prin-
ciples of political “correculess”, and
therebysuppressthought,discussi0n,
and progress, utlerly sickens me. I
had hoped that someone might pro-
test the gross distortions of truth,
reckless guilt»laying, and offensive
name-calling which appeared in
Allison Birch's letter to the 5&8 of
October 28, 1994. If I had railcd
againstEuropeans for destroying the
cullurcot‘ my Irish ancestors.lwould
have been laughed at. Ifl had said
aboutblack people someofthe things
she said about white people, I would
have ended up in ludCo (or worse).

I must take issue particularly
with four parts of Ms. Birch‘s bold
statement of righteous indignation:
the issue of guilt, the issue of
academia, the issue of threats, and
the issue of name-calling.

First, Ms. Birch assumes in her
demand for “reparations" that all
“Europeans" are guilty. “Europeans
in their crusade to conquer the world
and its ‘primitive’ peoples. have de-
stroyod African people and ouronce
prosperous systems.“ Ms. Birch
ought to specify which Europeans
she is referring to. Were they my
Irish ancestors who spent the age of
expansion occupied by English op-
prcssors'l Idoubt it. Were they my
Jewish relatives who‘s [sic] Polish
lands were being partitioned by Ger-
many and Russia? Again, I doubt it.
In the ﬁrst place I fail to soc how I
can be heldrcsponsible for the deeds
of my own ancestors. The idea that
I should bear the guilt of someone
clsc’s ancestors is completely ludi»
crousl

Turning to academia, Ms. Birch
secms to want to throw away some
ofthcgreat minds ofhistory because
they were members ofa racist soci~
cty. To throw away Freud‘s psycho»
analytic theory,l'lumc’sphilosophy.
all of Kipling, and countless others
because they shared the beliefs of
the society in which they lived is to
throw the baby out with the bath
water, Freud is about screwing your
mother and killing your father, not
screwing yoursistcr and killing your
brother. Itwas Western society, not
these men, who marginalized Afri-
cans in the Diaspora. So, the next
timel cream the universe, I’ll make
a note: Western society is bad for
Africans, and maybe we can avoid

this problem the next timc around.

Now, as if denying reality and
grossly ovcrsimplifying history were
not enough, Msl Birch poisons the
stream of logical discourse by way
of veiled threats. “If Europeans do
not help to equalize the unequal en-
vironment that they have created,
the suburbs in which most Europe-
ans are sheltered will be no more."
Threats are the terrorist acts of ratios
nal discourse. To threaten people in
this arena is to deserve not to be
listened to. However, this being
Grinnell, we had better invite Louis
Farrakhan, and we had better not
invite David Duke. Docs no one see
that progress comes from trust and
cooperation, not from unilateral ac
tion or coercion?

Finally. Ms. Birch takes it upon
herself to refer to all Europeans as
“the ‘gcncric’ race". This isaworse
mistake than the threats. I do not
feel that African Americans are in-
fcrior to myself, nor do I prefer the
exclusive company of white pwple.
I do not use racial slurs or intention-
ally chat people differently on the
basis of their race. I have never
maliciously hurt someone on the
basis of their race, age, sex. color,
religion, affectional preference, or
ethnic background. I therefore ex-
pect that Ms. Birch will, in future,
show me the common human dc—
cency of not mislabcling me on the
basis of a single genetic trait. I am
American, not European Further,
my European forebears came mostly
from Ireland. I find it highly offen-
sive, being Irish, to find myself
lumped together with French, GCI’V
mans, Spanish, or any other ethnic
group of which I am not a member.
This namrxcalling is the practice of
fccblcrmindcd racists and I suggest
that you divest yourself of the habit
as soon as you can.

I have an additional piece of
advice for Ms. Birch and the rest of
the Grinncll community. Don’t be»
lievc in something just because it
fits your comfonablc, knccj‘clk, later
twentieth-centuryliberalism. Think

about things even when you agrec
with them. Ask why. Progress can
only come through reasoned dis-
coursc. Threats, name-calling, and
blind conformism arc the cancers
ravaging the corpus of intellectual
and social progress.

Town/Campus Relations

1 think that campus security is
not a problem. lam not saying that
there is no lhet’l, rape. arson. vandals
ism.or harassment on campus caused
by college students, but instead that
students being hit by townspeople
with aluminum bats is not a campus
security issue as Sarah Wohlford
implied in the October 28 Scarlet at
Black. The real issue in this incident
is town/campus relationships.

How often have you been heck»
led or heard stories about college
studentsbeing harassed by town resi-
dents? They are nctrare cccurenccs.
Why is it that looking rcmotcly inlcl-
lectual is a cause {or drive-by verbal
abuse? Is it some kind of twtstad
Freudian brain envy? It seems that
the townspeople are the friendliest
people in the world, but some of the
younger ones lake every opportunity
to torment college students. What do
they want? I lhink that they would
know thatafler 150 years the campus
is not going to leave nor are the cur
rent students. if town residents [eel
inadequate when they do not reach
their weekly quom of college stu.
dents abused I suggest therapy.

The campus is relatively safe. I
don‘t mink we should take this rela-
tivc safety for complete safety on the
campus or in town. We are getting
more lighting installed currently
which, if nothing else, will make
people feel better on our two-block
havenbutwhy is itthatwhcna group
of people is walking down a wcll»lit
street on the edge olcampus they are
open for attack by townspeople?
There are possible solutions like get
ting more campus security or having
Wal-mart stop stocking aluminum
buts butncithcr will helpalleviatc the
underlying problem of town/ campus
relations.

Sincerely»
Iggy Pcrillo '97
