In this space, we intended to
write a short explanation of
our intentions and policies
for the 1971>72 Smrlet and
Black. Such an explanation
must wait until our first re—
gular issue, next Friday. Puts
ting out an eight page issue
of the S&Bisanawesometask;
the editors have beenassisted
this week by a tremendous
ly helpful, but pitifully small
staff; the bulk of the news
writing in this issue is our
own.

We especially want to thank
those who sent us columns
in time for publication in this
issue; if their writing conti-
nues to be of this quality,
these columns will be a vital
part of the paper. Also, spe-
cial thanks to those whose
names are listed as staff
members; we could not have
done it without you.

We would like to encourage
any students interested in para
ticipating in the studentnewsr
paper to come see us, perso-
nally, at the 581 B office in
the Forum basement. We will
try to be here Friday after-
noon, Saturday morning, and
Sunday afternoon. A snaffmeer
ting is scheduled for 7:30
Sunday evening, also at the
5&8 office.

The next edition of the paper
will not be a tworman job;
the time and talents of many
students will be required if
the Scarlet and Black is to
become the comprehensive
and accurate news paper, and
the thoughtful and stimulating
forum for campus opinion that
we envision. More on that
next week.

Walking through the streets
of Denmark's capital city one
is at a loss to name the pres
blems that beset it. Che sees
few if any derelicts, even in
the harbor area; the streets
are clean, almost unnaturally
so; police sirens seldom dis-
turb the peace. The busses
are new, clean, quiet, and
cheap; the subway is hard to
find and terribly unobtrusive.
Even the panhandlingalongthe
Walking Street is discreet;
the folks lounging around the

fountains are very patient, to '

judge from their facesr-no
hustling to get anything or
anywhere.

The municipality of Copenr
hagen embraces 33 square
miles in the northeranSt tip
of Denmark. This is the
area which most tourists and
visitors know as Copenhar
gen. But the area of Greater
Copenhagen, like that of Gr—
eater New York, covers a
much largerarear-ZZZ square
miles. TWCHIY’tWO indepenr
dent municipalities make up
Greater Copenhagen. The
capital municipality accounts
for 625,000 of the area's 1.4
million inhabitants.

Like many U. S. cities in
recent years, Copenhagen is
faced with a growing flood of
residents out of the city and

THE ‘SCARLET AND BLACK

'ChicIi/Biich/Womnn: Grinnell?

by Judy Kreissman

The movement for women at
Grinnell has been in existen-
ce for a couple of years now,
its activity ranging in size
from enormous to non—exis~
tent, and enthusiasm and ap-
proval rangingmuch the same.
Probably the highpoint of last
year‘s activities was the W07
men’s Liberation Conference
held last fall, which brought
participants from as far away
as Texas, New York and Ca-
nada. It was an incredible
weekend for most of the peo-
ple involved, in learningabout
the movement and their place
in it.

Plans this year for women's
groups and activities are in
a ﬂoating stage - waiting to
hear what women on campus
feel is needed , what acti~
vities would be most benefia
cial and practical. Some thou-
ghts so far include the es*
tablishment of awomen’s cen-
ter with facilities for birth
control counselling and hope»
fully care by doctors, as_ well
as a forum for women to con-
gregate and share ideas and
plans. This center would be
open to all women of Grin-
nell , townswomen, student
women, faculty women, and
faculty wives. There is so

much that can be done in the
town of Grinnell and an enorr
mous amount to learn from the
women around us.

Another

plan is the conversion of C07
noco House (on 6th Street)
to a women's cor’op where lite
erature and information would
be readily available.
Important issues that can be
confronted this year are: Why
is there such a lack of fe-
male professors at Grinnell?
What is the availability and
smtus of positions opentow07
men’! How much job discri-
mination exists in Grinnell?
To what extent (if any) is the
enourmous knowledge of the
wives of faculty members tak-
en advantage? These are de,
finite existing problems
that we should look into.
Rather than numerous spe-
cific plans, we hope the ems
phasis for any group that
forms this year will be on
the fostering of a working
community of Grinnell women.
It is amazinghow fulfillingand
helpful participation in a wo-
men's group can be, particuv
larly with the socialproblems
that confront us all at Grins
nell. Sometime in the near
future the first meeting for
women on campus will be
organized. If you are new on
campus, or if you are re
turning, no matter what your
previous experience of con-
ceptions about the women’s
liberation movement is, ple-
ase come and join us. You
have nothing to lose but a
little time and a few chains.

into the outlying suburban mun
niclpalities. This has created
at least one very seriouspro-
blem» ,2, shrinkingtaxbase for
the city. American city dwel-
lers are not unfamiliar with
this dilemna. Although the
cost of the capital city‘smany
social benefits is rising ans
nually, the number of taxable
individuals living in the cityis
decreasing. This has been
especially true in the pasttwo
years.

One reason for the exodus is
a sheer lack of housing. The
main urban municipalities of
Copenhagen and Frediksborg
are more or less completely
builtrup. (After all, Copenr
hagen has been an independent
city since 1660). The out-
lying, suburban areasare less
congested, and offer greater
opportunities for housing de
velopment.

Another stimulus to emigra—
tion is Denmark’s tax system.
All residents pay a graduated
income tax to the State go-
vcrnmcnt, but they are also
subject to similar tariffs le-
vied by the city in which they
live. The municipality of Co-
penhagen imposes a heavier
levy than the outer areas. It
thus behooves a resident to
move to the suburbs while
maintaining an occupation in
the city, He will not only

have an easier time securing
housing, but also more money
to spend after taxes.

The municipality of Copanhar
gen is attacking this problem
head—on, In 1964 an agree
ment between the State and the
City of Copenhagen enabled the
city to gain control over3,000
acres ofland--much ofitland-
ﬁll--on the nearby island of
Amager. Thisacquisition, eq-
ualling 15% of the total Cm
penhagen area, will provide
space for an estimated 25,000
new flats.

To make the city a more
desirable place to live, the
city has been urging the out
lying municipalities to ens
courage the development of
light, "clean" industries in
their areas and to increase the
scope of social benefits offer
red there. New industry will
of course require services
from the local government.
Improvements will cause hi-
gher taxes to cover the costs.
and will have theaddedadvan-
tage of making the suburbs
less fragile communities.

Despite this and other pro—
blems, Copenhagen is still a
city where the Lord Mayor can
happily proclaim over break-
fast that he thinks things are
OK in his city. How many
American mayors can say the
same thing7

Student Housing Filled

The campus is filled with
people thisyear, butaccording
to the office of the Dean of
Student Affairs Thursday,
provision had been made to
house all but 6 students in
permanent College housing.
For those few, temporary con-
tingency housing is standing
by, if there is not the required
number of withdrawals by the
weekend.

1270 students are expected
to appear by registration time
next Monday, a record crowd
for the Grinnell campus. Two
extra houses were converted
to student use this year to

accomodate the large student
body. The houses, at 1227
and 1217 Park Street, will
provide permanent housingfor
eight students each.

If permanent places are not
found for some men, they will
be temporarily housed at 1131
Park Street; women would
stay at Grinnell house until a
permanent place is found for
them. According to Admis-
sions Director Nick Ryan, the
College expects a fewstudents
to withdraw during the first
few days of the semester, thus
opening a few more places in
the dormitories.

Walker Calls Finances 'Serious

Dean of Administration Wal-
do Walker reported to the
faculty on the financial state
of the college. Dean Walker
discussed past budgetary der
ficits and later projected the
budget for next year.

Current operations expendia
tures beginning July, 1970
were set at $6,067,000. To
balance that budgeted amount,
$966,000 in unrestricted gifts
would have to be taken in.
In the previous, fairly pro»
cuctive year, $776,000 in unr
restricted gifts was mken in.
In addition, by July 1970, the
accumulated current fund den
ficit totatled $256,000.

Also, by the time the new
Physical Education complex
was completed the College
would have a Plant Fund de-
ficit of $1,500,000. Therefore,
the projected total deficit at
the beginning of the July, 1970
fiscal year was $1,756,000.
The current fund for the
fiscal year ending two months
ago shows a surplus balance
of $95,000. The positive bar
lance was immediatelyapplied
to the $256,000 Current Fund
deficit accrued during the two
preceding years. Some rea-
sons for this year's positive
balance are that faculty and
administration cooperated in
holding down expenditures,
there was a higher return
from investments of endow
ment than anticipated, and a
conservative estimate was
projected for the number of
students for this year. Still,
Dean Walker concluded that
Grinnell’s financial problems
are, as he said last year,
"serious but not critical"

The Board of Trustees re-
quested a reduction in the
operations budget for this
year. They requested that the
amount of unrestricted gift
money necessary to balance
the budget be reduced to $600,
000, which is approximately
$350,000 less than last year
if other revenues remained the
same. The $350,000 difference
was compensated for by an
increase of $175 per student
in tuition, an expansion of
the student body, anda size-
able reduction of projected
expenditures in all categories
of the budget. Therefore, the
1971~72 budget is smaller
than the previous year even
though inﬂation forced costs
to a higher level. It will also
be more difficult to hold ex-
penditures at the level buds
gated this year because there
is less latitude for the de-
partments of the college to
operate within and bemuse
this is the second year of
restricted expenditures and
most budget itemsarealready
at a minimum.

In projecting the budget for
next year, Dean Walker said
price and wage controls would
have to be clarified before a
meaningful projection can be
attempted. He feels the col-
lege should honor salary and
wage obligations with the col-

lege that were establishedbe-‘
fore the freeze if it can pose
sibly do so within the law.
Walker believes that ifthe law
allows 1972773 salary raise
considerations should allow
for the fact that 71772 raises
have been minimal.

Reporting for the Committee
on Admissions and Student
Financial Aid, Dean Walker
projected initial student en-
rollment for 1971172 at 1,
270, which should level out
to 1250 by Sept. 15. 427 are
new students with the male-
female breakdown about equal.
There will be 41 transfer stu-
dents this year in contrast to
only 22 last year. Nineteen
new black students and three
new foreign students are en-
rolled. The College expects
about a 20 student early at
trition rate. Eighteenstudents
have received leaves of ab
sence to study abroad.

1,166 applications were re»
ceived this year with a 51%
acceptance rate. Of these ape
plicants, 564 applied for fi-
nancial aid, 388 were granted
admission, and 276 were of-
ferred financialaid. Eventual‘
1y, 150 enrolled with financi.
assistance. The committe-
discussed the decline in th.
number of applicants froi
Iowa. They alsorecommende.
an increase in the proportio
of student loans as oppose-1
to scholarship loans.
