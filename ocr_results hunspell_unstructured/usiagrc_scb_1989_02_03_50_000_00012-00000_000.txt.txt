Album Review

The Reivers are
finally settling down

by Thomas Beverly

Capitol has just issued a new
album by The Reivers, End of
the Day, one of the first releases
of the year. This third widely
distributed album by the Austin,
Texas hand finds The Reivers
settling down, getting used to
being a rock band, and beginning
the uncertain process of growing
up.

John Croslin, who now
nearly monopolizes the group’s
songwriting and leadsinging
duties, signs on as producer as
well for this moody collection of
memories and heartaches.
Croslin’s lyrics, which once may
have lectured too much, now bear
a humility that lingers behind
these new songs, as in the superb
”Almost Home”: “...I might as
well confess that l have not got
the nerve / To borrow cigarettes."
The songs lament lost years, lost
loves, lost time, and lost
confidence with Croslin’s typi
cally bizarre selection of
metaphors, but somehow the
album avoids the outright
depression of the Motrisscys of
the world.

Musically, The Reivers have
matured. The exhuberant crash
and twang of their previous two
albums, Saturday and Translate
Slowly (the latter being made
under the name Zeitgeist), has
subsided into a more subdued roar
of acoustic guitar and Garrett
Williams’ percussion. Unfor»
tunately, this maturing process
has resulted in less adventurous
songwriting. No song here can
match the quiet intensity of
“Legendary Man" (from Translate
slowly) or the explosive energy
of ”Wait For Time" (from
Saturday); rather, the songs on

236 —

End of the Day are caught
somewhere in between, with
consistent but ordinary energy
and safe choruses and bridges.
Sadly, Kim Longacre‘s powerful
voice is not heard nearly enough.
and her harmonies with Croslin
are a trifle less daring, but both
voices are as strong and
expressive as ever.

Despite these differences from
their past work, The Reivers have
managed to chum out yet another
tuneful piece of Texas that bears
repeated listening. “It's About
Time" kicks off the album with
flare, followed by the yeaming
memories of “Star Telegram,"
which set the mood for much of
the rest of the album. “Cut
Above” and “Truth to Tell”
threaten to pull Lhe album down
to the level of Springsteen’s
most mundane ideas, but these
lapses are redeemed by "End of
the Day" and particularly by the
fantastic “Almost Home," a
frustrated expression of boredom
and anxiety.

End of the Day delivers 12
fine examples of the thriving
Texas-based musical style that is
gaining momentum on college
radio stations across the country,
and it should appeal to a wide
variety of people. There is a
rough familiarity one feels with
Croslin’s emotional contempla-
tions, and the album as a whole
is quite satisfying lyrically and
musically. If The Reivers can
avoid following groups like
R.E.M. into illradvised
commercial experimentation,
they should be a band to keep an
eye on for several years.

Burling Gallery
photo exhibit:
Loess Hills

Through the month of
February, 36 photographs of
western Iowa's Loess Hills of
western Iowa are on display in
Burling Gallery, on the lower
level of Burling Library. The
exhibition, by photographer Don
Poggensee, is sponsored by the
Iowa Natural Heritage Founda-
tion.

The Loess Hills start at the
eastern edge of the Missouri
River flood plain and are com-
posed of finely ground matertal
washed out of melting glaciers,
picked up by prevailing winds,
and deposited in a band of hills
resembling hugc snowdrtfts.
This fine silt, or loess. is fairly
common throughout the world.
but rarely reaches the ZOO-foot
depths found In Iowa. Hills
similar to these are found only tn
the Kansu Province of China.

In recent years, Poggensee,
who grew up in western Iowa,
has combined his interests in
photography and ﬂying to htghr
light Iowa's natural resources.
Due to increased efforts by pri—
vate organizations and public
agencies, the Loess Hills have
been declared a national natural
landmark by the National Park
Service.

The cxllibtlion will continue
through February 28. Burling
Gallery is open during regular li»
bmry hours.
