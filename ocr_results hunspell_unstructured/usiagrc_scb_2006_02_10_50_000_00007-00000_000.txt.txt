"Abuse of amphetamines may
lead to dependence. Misuse of ~

death and serious cardiovascular
, adverse events. These events
have also beﬁn reported rarely
'withyamphetamine use.”

ln Febunry, 2005, Health
canadiari suspended the sale oi
Adderall to children after reports
oi sudden unexplained death
(SUD) In children uking Addemll
and Adderall XR. Of the l2
deaths, five children were found
to have structural heart defects
and none were using the drug
without a prescription. The drug
has since returned re the market,
but the FDA is continuing close
moniroring of Addcrall.

a new label: drug user. The
prescription Attention
Deficit Disorder (ADD)
drug Adderall, an analepric
stimulant similar to Ritalin,
is primarily used illegally by
students to help them ﬁn-
ish homework. Since stur
dents use the drug to study
hard, not party hard, users
have avoided rhe scrutiny
and stigmas often associated
with illegal drug use.
Addcrall, like any am-
phetamine, speeds up the

, user’s heart rate, which can

cause unpleasant side effects
such as swearing, dry mouth,
headaches and insomnia,
according to the manufac—
turer’s websire. “What drugs

" like Ritalin and Adderall do

is they activate the alerting

' systems of the brain respon-

sible for wakefulness," said
Raphael Cabeza, Biology,
who does research on sleep.
For users, this can produce
hours of intense focus and
energy, which appeals to
students looking to study
fast and hard.

is no deﬁnitive wav ro track who is using the drug
because the annual anonymous Health Center survey
does not ask about Addernll. Also there is not a list
ofall studenrs with prescriprions an campus. Though
the school psychiatrist keeps rrack of the snidenrs
whom she treats, many students obtain their prescripc
tions at home.

According to the FDA, pre-
scriptions for Addcrau have risen

The manufacturer, Shire Pharmaceuticals, real-
izes that Addcrall has the potential for abuse. They
dispense the drug in oncerarday pill doses of five to
30 milligrams. “Shire is aware that there is an abuse
porenrial and we stand in taking
rhe appropriate dosage wirh a valid
prescription, Unfortunately we’re
only in the part of manufacturing
and we try to regulate with the
FDA and the DEA about abuse
potential and making sure that it
is appropriately used," a spokesperr
son for Shire told The 888.

The DEA and FDA are concerned about the risks
of taking the drug without a prescription and thus
without professional supemsion of its physical and
psychological side effects, including dependency. “Ad—
dicrion is not a simple process," said Cabeza.“1t's not
like, the drug does this, that means it’s addictiveflnr
stead, he said, chemicals in prescription drugs can arr
fecr two people in completely diirerent ways and per-
sonality also plays a large role in whether rhe user will
become dependent. “Prescription drugs are prescripr
tion for a reason,” said Beth Chung '94, who works as
a psychiatrist in the Health Center, “they can be very
dangerous if taken ineorrecdy people go to school
for years to learn how to prescribe these drugs it is
never okay to take them without a prescription."

According to the FDA website, no fatalities have
occurred from abuse or misuse of Addcrall by itself.

Chung worries about Grinnell srudcnts taking Ad-
derall with other drugs, especially alcohol. “The et-
rects of alcohol are delayed [when raking Adderall]
and srudents will not be able to tell how much they
are drinking or how drunk rhcy are getting.” current-
ly, the administration has no pliln for moniroring ilc
legal Adderall use on campus. Students with Addcrall
problems who want ro seek solutions are direcrcd to
make use of the Health Center's anonymous walk-in
visits.

“It’s not that hard to find it heie lit all,” said Tram
vis‘, a senior who has used Addernll roughly every
three weeks for the last two academic years. “It used to
be a lot harder to gel.You used to have to buy irwccks
in advance and it would be more evpensive, Now you
can buy it the same day." He attributes the change to
an increased number or smdcnts with prescriptions
on campus, who give or sell the drug ro their friends.
“Usually it's not hard to get a pier
scriprion, especially in Grinnell
where people are so into menral
hcalrh ., most of the people who
go to this school are pretty smart
and know how to fake their way
rlii-ough rhings,"

ers have toward the drug reveals a deeper skepticism
abour the legal use of the drug for a disorder which
is infamously misdiagnosed. While Erika considers
speed drugs like cocaine and meth, which have simi-
lar yer much more severe effects
than Adderall, “a foreign thing,"
prescription drugs are familiar
and relatively benign. “we all
grew up with kids in our grade-
school classes raking Ritalin and
Addcrall,” she said, “I'm not even
convinced that ADD exists."

More ethical gray area for students stems from
how Adderall irsclt is bought and used on campus.
Since it is primarily consumed as a srudy drug, even
students who are personally anticdrug are often die
vided about others' use of Adderall. “It’s socially ac-
ceptable to abuse caffeine,saidjon Henry '07, a south
campus SA. “So for many students. it is hard to say
it’s absolutely wrong to abuse a substance to improve
your academics."

Dealers at Grinnell are typically prescribed users
who sell their unused pills to close friends for little or
no profit. "I would never think of it like I need to go to
a drug dealer [to buy Adderall]," said a north campus
ﬁrSITyCSL Erika found nothing unusual about taking
her pills in public. "I was in Cleveland computer lab,
taking pills and people are all
giving me advice."

had a shrink and I asked ‘

for it," he wrote in an email

to the 5651?. He takes the -

drug occasionally, either to
study or “recreationally,” but
usually he sells his 20 mil
ligram pills to between is
and 20 people a month and
estimates he makes $100
per month from the sales.
He claims that he does not
feel like a drug dealer. “It
doesn’t feel like drugrdealing
because for every pill I sell,
that's one loss I take, which
makes getting rid of rhem
a beneficial activity for my
personsl health."

itself, fears of dependency
loom large. Jim: another
firstcycar with a self-recogc
niaed addictive personality, said he opts for personal
regulation of his Adderall usage. “I take it hesitantly
and cautiously I'm raking ii in such moderation
e halroi what is prescribed," he said Even wirh such
precautions, rhe student acknowledged that he found
himself raking Addcrill “in situations that, before 1
had started, Iwouldni have needed it. He assumes he

rhc senior who has been using the drug since soplitr
more yeii. “lfl had to sit down and plan our my work,
i would have dropped out of this school three years
