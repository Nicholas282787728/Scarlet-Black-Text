vor the plan may petition the
curriculum committee for permis-
sion to irse the system,

Each application is to be passed
on individually by the committee
and will be approved only in

inent may safely he tried.

The faculty is understood to
have favored the plan but felt
that complete adoption of it would
be too great a change and that
a semester's testing worrld be ad-
visable.

taught by Earl D. Strong,
fessor of economics, has already
voted in favor of the plan and
several other classes plan to vote
