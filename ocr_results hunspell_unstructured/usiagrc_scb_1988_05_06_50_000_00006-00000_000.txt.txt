Disillusioned

with His

Peace Day Experience

To the Editor:

Peace ~ it's a wonderful idea,
but is it possible? First, one must
believe it is, Everyone must, or
nothing will change. But that is
just the tirst step. People must
communicate. it everyone believes
in the same goal and is willing to
work for its achievement, then this
goal must be communicated. How
can a common goal be realized if
no one knows it is a common goal?
Now, it seems communicating this
common goal is a problem. How is
it done? Enter Peace Day.

1 was somewhat skeptical of
Peace Day, but I really like the
idea: all the people in lowa com.
municating this common goal,
enhanced by speakers who have
activated changes or are currently
working towards change. Hmm...
Maybe this will make a difference
That was what I was thinking the
night l designed the logo tor the
Peace Day T-shirt, Maybe I can
communicate my hopes by design
ing a T-shirt and ii it is chosen as
the design, all right, 1'11 be happy.
and if not, that too is fine. [submitr
ted the design to Tom Josephs
Berger a week beiore spring
break. I checked my mail box the
week following break but heard
nothing. I assumed that that was
the last oi my Peace Day T-shirt
design. Then, on April 1, the third
week after break, five weeks after
I had submitted the design, and
less than two weeks before Peace
Day, I received a call from Mr.
Josephs-Berger. He called around
5 in the evening Monday wanting
the design enlarged to T-shirt size
by Wednesday. This was a two-
hour process and i did not have sui7
iicient preparation time to get it
done beiore Thursday evening. I

Knee-Jerk Liberalism

To the Editor:

Recently two events took place
on campus that demonstrated the
ineptness of Grinnell's kneejerk
liberalism, The two events took
place simultaneously on Central
Campus. One was a celebration oi
the oath anniversary oi the lsraeli
state. the other the building of a
shanty town to protest Grinnell’s
investment in companies dealing
With South Africa. I could not help
but think it was ironic that during
the course of the afternoon. the
workers setting up the shanty town
would go over and eat the iood set
up for the lsraell celebration. Ap-
parently it did not matter to these
protesters that lsrael is one oi
South Africa’s largest trading
partners and the largest buyers of
Israeli arms (this includes riot
gear), The celebration of Israel
and Jewish culture is an event that

submitted the completed design on
Friday, eight days beiore Peace
Day. Today is Peace Day. in 40
minutes, I will be listening to Dick
Gregory begin the Peace Day ac»
tivities. I will probably see a lot of
Peace Day T-Shirts, but I will not
be surprised that they are only
basmrdizatinns oi my design. This
is because Tom Josephsnerger
approached me last night at 11:00
while i was on my way to view
“Yellow Submarine” to iniorm
me, so I “wouldn’t be too upset" on
Peace Day, that only part or my
design would actually be printed
on the shirt, Only the world globe
would be printed with the logo
changed irom “Peaceable? Posse
ble... Let's Make It Probable” to
“Cultivate World Peace, All Iowa
Peace Day." Now, 1 like both
logos, but it upset me that l was
never consulted, notified after the
change had been made. and then
only 12 hours before I would see the
Tashirt. I was confronted with
some serious questions. Do I get
the award oi two free T-shirts, or
does the person who changed the
design? If I do get the two T-shirts,
do 1 get T-shirts with my design or
the new, improved design? My
parents wanted a copy oi the
Trshirt when I told them my design
had been chosen, What do I tell
them, that I was just kidding? But
really, the serious question is: it
communication can't take place in
a community oi 1200 individuals,
then how can it ever happen
worldwide", Yes, I'm a bit disillur
sioned. That's why I‘m getting this
out oi my system now, so that I can
go and enjoy Peace Day and
‘cultivate' some new ideas about
world peace. 7 Glen Widmer

people should participate in on

ment protesters realize the im-
plications of their actions. It is ox-
ymoronic to eat cake at the
celebration oi one oi South Airica’s
largest foreign military suppliers
while screaming ior the divest
ment of a small college’s stock

the Campus’ awareness oi certain
events is iine, but not when it only
serves to illustrate your own lg-
norance in your cause. The next
time you feel like frolicking in the
sun yelling obscenities at
Grinnell’s trustees, investigate the
circumstances surrounding the
event. To protest [or the sake oi
protesting may be run, but unior-

Yearbook not Appreciated
Until Existence is Threatened

To the Editor:

All oi a sudden, people on this
campus are panicking, “Did you
hear? There may not be a year7
book next year. No one's applied
for the editor position." When I
hear thisI I want to laugh. but [also
want to cry. The yearbook is a
reﬂection oi campus involvement
and campus interest in preserving
its memories and identity.
Everyone wants a yearbook. Sure,
we all want to look at memorable
pictures oi ourselves when we are
bouncing the next generation oi
Grinnell studenm on our knees.
“Look, here’s Daddy getting drunk
at Relays.” “See, this is ARH, this
is where Daddy and I met." ”Oh
look. there's my old roommate.” I.
bet some students have already
been flipping through their high7
school yearbooks occasionally as
they stroll down memory lane, and
that's wonderful! That's what
yearbooks are there for! Uniorr
tunately, nobody wants to make
the yearbook. We all just want the
yearbook {airy to descend upon
campus in late October, be fruitful
and multiply. Who cares about the

work? it gets done by some
studenE who have nothing better
to do. Besides, all those publication
jobs are paid, aren’t they?

Heck, yes. Those publication
jobs are paid, and quite well: our
current photo editor is getting a
whopping 10 cean per hour. our
editor-inchiel less than that.
Thank God, none oi us are in this
for the money, and we shouldn‘t

it will be it), 20, 50 years down the
line.

During my past two years here
at Grinnell, we have been excep
tionally lucky in that we have had
outstanding and dedicated in-
dividuals fill the demanding pose
tion of editor~inrchief of the
Cyclone yearbook. in fact, i ieel
that the college was spoiled rotten
by having these individuals take
such a burden upon themselves.
Now it seems like the honeymoon
is over. All of a sudden, the stark
reality of what a yearbook can
mean to a campus community is

coming out irom behind a cloud of
apathy.

I hope that there is a yearbook
next year. Uniortunately, it seems
that the general campus popula-
tion couldn’t care less. There'll
probably be a yearbook next year.
It’s going to be the lovechild oi a
handiul oi dedicated people, just as
has been the case in the past icw
years, and unless this campus
wakes up and realizes what's in-
volved, these iew people will be
rewarded with those wonderiul

Student Calls for Pre-Initiative

Debate

To the Editor:

The recently proposed student
initiative on increasing minimum
wage. although wellintended,
might have detrimental eiiects. I
am talking about the well-known
debate on whether or not minimum
wage laws protect the worker. it
seems to me that in theory, raising
the minimum wage would be a
good idea, but when i thought
about it more closely I started to
doubt. I asked myslf: what about
those teenagers who want to work
but whose services are not worth
the minimum wage to the
employeri For instance, there is
not much a lbryear~old can do. He
or she is probably not very skilled,
and his or her scrvrces are worth
less than the minimum wage. in
other words, what‘s going to hapr
pen to those jobs that are worth
less than the minimum? will they
all oi a sudden be worth the
minimum or Will they disappear?
Here is where l smrted to doubt,
and so lconsul ted a book and iound
the iollowing;

Alter the 19505, the enforced
minimum wage has been rising
pretty steadily but alasl so has
teenage unemployment. In the ear-
ly 1950s, teenage unemployment
was around to percent, and it was

relatively similar ior both black
and white teenagers. By 1973, due
to the gradual and steady rise oi
the minimum wage, teenage
unemployment was up irom 15 per
cent to 20 percent ior whites, but
irom as percent to 45 percent ior
blacksl Could it be possible that
the rise oi the minimum wage
could be correlated to teenage-
unemployment rates? Is one caus
ing the otheri li you were a seliish
employer, would you pay $3.45 to
somebody whose work is worth on-
ly $2 to you? The law says you
shouldl But couldn‘t you merely
hire somebody whose work is
worth $3.45 to you and not hire the
teenager whose work is worth only
$2 to you? It seems that the
employer could, Now notice In the
figures I cited that a gap has
developed between teenage
unemployment rates ior blacks
and whites. Could it be that
employers are ireer to
discriminate against blacks,
thanks to the minimumwage
laws?

The debate over the minimum
wage is pretty complex. We have
to provide some protection tor the
worker, but in so doing we might
harm some workers, particularly

the least specialized ones in the
Third World, ior instance, one oi
the biggest problems is that there
are companies which hire iew
skilled workers and a lot oi
machines and technology, while
there are a zillion peasants out
there in search oi a job. why can’t
these companies hire more
workers and trash the machines?
Could it be that an extremely high
minimum wage is contributing to
this situation at structural
unemployment? Are the unions
really ior the average wor ers or
are they in iavor ot the pri leged
specialized ones? No easy answer
exists ior these questions.

In short, I think a debate should
precede each student .mitiative so
that students could be better in-
iormed about the issues. I did not
vote on Wednesday in [avor oi that
initiative ior the increment oi the
minimum wage. I simply do not
have it clear on my mind whether
or not it will protectevery worker.
