A year ago. a group ofstuclent activists met
and formed the No lelts Project (NLP), a
student group that aimed to push the admin-
istration to maintain commitments to so—
cial justice, among other reforms. The group
published a list of demands sent to President
Russell K. Osgood—demands that it has been
working to achieve for the past year

“The No Limits Ptoiect has come a long
way since the 14 demands were proposed by
kind ofa core group orstudents and supported
by over 200 students who expressed their sup
port in a petition we circulated I think within
48 hours we got over 300 signatures," said
Margie Scribner '10, an NLP member, said.

Three large demands have been met since
the group was ﬁIsl active. including the cre-
ation ofAJustia peer education program cre-
ated to tackle social justice issues m the com»
rnumty.

Ajust, many ofwhosc members are also In
NLP, has worked closely with Student Affairs
to secure funding and to bring in facilitators to
assist training peer educators.

“We're obviously looking tor a greater tr»
nanclal commitment from the administration,
but right now we’re able to do the types otpro-
gtarrrming we want to do with the money that
we've been allocated," Scribner said.

The administration said they have lent sup
port to AJust and supported them throughout
the process.

“The ﬁrst two projects (socialjustice traln‘
inFAJIIst—and hate crimes/bias incident
response) were ideas that we had hatched and
begun working on in Student Attairs berore
NLP existed," said Vice President of Student

NLP also demanded the drafting and
implementation of a Bias Motivated Incident
and Hate Crimes Response policy—which
was lirrally created last semester and enacted
in November 2009.

A further demand called for Gl’innell to
renew Its Commitment to environmcmal Susi
tarnabrlrty and power the campus with a wind
turbine, While the turbine itself has been ap-
proved, and planning for it is itr its initial stage,
the greatest obstacle to woikon the turbines is
the prohibitive Cost.

“I can't snap my ﬁngers and ﬁnd 871mb

lion, which rs roughly what it will cost," 03*
good said.

To address this, NLP worked with SGA,
Free The Planet and the Senior Challenge
Committee to add a Green Giving option to
the senior challenge tonn

Progress on the demands has not been
without setbacks,as NLP encounters the chair
leuges ofdealing with any butcaueratre admrnr
istration.

“i think especially the demands that don't
involve any ﬁnancial commitment are ones
that could’vc been and probably should've
been acted on faster," Kaitlin Alsofrom ’10,
who is involwzd with NLP, said.

The Hate Crimes Response protocol along
with the wind turbines were seen as prime
examples of demands that some. members of

NLP thought could have been met in a more
timely fashion.

[Its ﬂusttaung] when pcopl e say Well
were working on It and tlrats the end or it,
as though we‘re just supposed to accept that
without asking for any notiﬁcauon of any re»
sults otwhatever it is that's being worked on,
or being included in any or the processes that
are being worked on,"Jared Rubinstein '10, a
member oi'NLP, said.

However, there has not been ofﬁcial col-
laboration between NLP and the Office ofthe
Fiesident nor Student Affairs within the last
yeae

“Nothing ofﬁcmlwuh
NLP folks," said Dean of
Students Travis Greene.
“1 know the premise
ofNo Limits was here are
some things from their
perspective that could'rc immediately been
done or implemented, but things are organic
and they do take some time," Greene said.

Desprte such obstacles, the project will
[oritimlc by recommuting itself to a one of
their original demand57needsblind admis-
sion for international students.

“Several years ago we actually did have
need blind admission to international stun
dents,” Alsofrom said.

Now, only domestic students are admitted
on a needrblrnd basis. Although the college
maintains its commitment to meeting 100
percent of demonstrated need to all students,
that need is taken into account when interna-
tional students are admitted.

“We're in the initial works of this, ﬁgurr
rng out why that policy was changed, what we

 

 

would need to do to get it back to need- blind
admission where it was several years ago Al-
sofiom said.

Student response to the No Limits Project
and its methods was initially mixcdidespite
much obvious support through the signatures,
many students felt that the organization was
benrg too aggressive, or acting unnecessarily,
an idea that appears to have faded with time
as the organization's successes and goals have
become more clear.

“1 just remember going to Joint Board
when the No Limits people were presenting,
and they were being very aggressive in their
language towards SGA, I just remember them
saying, we demand this, and we demand
thlit,"'Ana Mancebo '12 said.

These sentiments manitcsted through the
formation of an opposing group entitled No
Sliainc,\vliich attempted to shirt student rot-us
towards beneﬁcial things that the administra-
tion had done for students while still acknowl-
edging that worlt needs to be done, refer to the
April 10, 2009 SEE for information

However, now, seeing that progress has
been lnade rn many areas, there is acceptance
of them among students who were dubious
of NLP, although alienatron due to their per-
ceived aggression remains, and many under
classmen have no idea who they are.

“In retrospect, it seemed like they were
asking for a lot and potentially in the wrong
way when they started ott, and I guess after
seeing they have made some compromises that
have given them some ofthe things they asked
for,I can see that it may have been useful," Isa—
iah Iboko ’12 said.
