ReNew to hold “Mardi Gras Week”

BY MATTHEW ZMUDKA

Despire the lack of a parade. costumes, and rampant flashing, ReNew or-
leans hopes to bring a taste efMattli Gras to Grinnell next week while raising
awareness for their relief eiforts,

The group. which sends students to rebuild homes in New Orleans, wiLl be
holding a “Mardi Gras Week” from
Feb 4 to 9. The week’s events will
include a screening of spike Lee's
fourpart documentary “When the
Levees Broke," split between Mon-
day and Tuesday night, mask-make
ing on Thrrrsday night and a Mardi
Gras Harris Party on Saturday All
events come complete with beads, ‘
and ReNew is looking into provide
ing king cakes, the traditional dessert
ofMardi Gras.

“Mardi Gras “leek"was conceived by ReNew member Josie GCn‘lel’tS ’10 to
raise money for the group's spring break trip. “A lot of the tundraisrng that we
do goes straight to orrt trips, Just becarrse it is costly," she said. The group will
collect donations at every event.

Wednesday will also feature an intermarional session for a volunteer trrp to
New orleans over break, the centerpiece of ReNew’s efforts. 18 participants
will pay $100 to travel to New Orleans and work with the Episcopal Diocese of
Louisiana for two weeks. “We want to make it so that anyone who wants to go,
regardless ofwhethet they can pay the participation fee, cart ge,"Gerrietts said.

According to Amy Rothbaum '08, ReNew began as a way to sustain the
elferts of Aerr-eak and the Chaplains Offree, both of whreh sent people to
work in New Orleans immediately after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “It was the
people who interned [in New Orleans] that summer," she said. Part ofrhr goal

of the group's activities is also to keep the damage from llurricane karrina in
the school’s consciousness.

In its brief existence, ReNew has been instrumental in promoting student
work in New Orleans. Frye ofseven crrrrent interns with the Episcopal diocese
are Grinnell dums, and last summer, 13 of the 25 interns were from Grinrlell,

“This has been a priority for a large number otcrinncll students."
Rothbaum said.

Adam Bruinei '07,who now works for Teach for America in New
Orleans, was impressed by the amount ofparticipation in ReNew. “It
is almost as if the spirit ofjosiah Grinncll has risen and told us to
‘Go Southl’” he said. “It is great to know that ReNew volunteers are
helping to rebrrild their neighborhoods and maybe even their homes
or their neighbors homcsr" Brurner joins Grinnellrans Katie Meats
'03 (the original New Orleans contact for ReNew), Liz Carrier ’07,
Maggrc lmmler '07, Ross Koon '07, and Amanda Davrs ’04,

Despite the increased participation and interest ReNews growth
has not been without prohl ems Last fall, two student ears collided in Mis»
sissippr while returning to Grinncll, arising some controversy wrtlrrn college
administration rcgli'ding student drivers ReNew rs taking steps, however, to
rcducc ks for drivers and participants.

“In a perfect world, ifwe had all the funding we wanted, we could just ﬁy
down", Gel‘tietts said.

Rothbaum, who is on the transportation policy committee for thc College,
added: “We will talk wrth people aborrt car safety, don’t tailgate, We will stress
to our participants that their families need to know where they are and who
they’re with."

Eventually, they would like to see ReNew grow into a general disaster relief
organization. “There is a desire for people to do rebuilding projects in plaees af-
fected by natural disasters." Rothbaum said, adding that “Mardl Gi as Week" is a
way to increase ﬁnancial capacity and interest for additional efforts.

Open-door drug use leads to arrests, charges

BY RACHEL FIELDS

At 11 p.rn,on Friday night, Rathjc resident
Nathan Levin'lO and some ofhis friends were
smoking marijuana in the main room oftheir
quad.

By the end of the evening three students
were ticketed as minors under the inﬂuence of
alcohol, and the other five students were taken
to the police station for interrogation. Levin
was eventually charged {or possession ormari-
juana paraphernalia and as a minor in posses»
sion ofalcohol.

The door to their room was open when a
security guard making regular rounds smelled
the marijuana,The guard contacted RLC Jenn
nifer Bieniek, and they then called the police.

Levin said the security guard asked the
students for identiﬁcation and requested that
they stay in the room with the door open.

When a Grinnell Police Department official
arrived, the eight students were removed from
the room, identiﬁed and searched, and Levin
said that the police asked the quad’s residents
for permission to search the room.

“He basically said, ‘You can either give me
permission right now or I can arrest you guys,
take you to jail, and get a search warrant to
search the room,” Levin said.

“I think the policy, whenever possible,
should be to handle these situations through
discussion and punishment assigned by the
college," Levin said. "No one had complained
about the pot smoking or even the party. Now
a basically harmless activity has been handled
with some pretty extreme consequences."

Though RLCs and security ofﬁcials are
technically obligated to report drug use on
campus, many students feel that there is an un—

written undersranding between administrators
and students. Student advisors are not asked to
repertcases ofdrug use or possession. In 2006.
only one drug law violation was referred for
disciplinary action by rhe college, according to
a 2004-2006 campus crime statistics report.

Following rumors of recent room searches
on campus, Levin worries that the Grinnell are
titude towards student drug use is changing.

“ ’ve always thought that [Grinnell] isn't
just a school with security guards, it’s a com-
munity," Levin said. “If security is searching
people’s rooms without telling them and go-
ing out of their way to get kids arrested, it’ll
become another situation where a force that’s
supposed to be protecting the students on
campus actually becomes a feared entity”

Blenlek understands Levin's concerns, adds
ing that she prefers to defuse a situation than

get her students in trouble. We' lust want stu-
dents to be safe," she said idontgo out look
ing for [marijuana use], and i think that RLCs
are pretty laid back ‘in a lot ofsituations."

Gtinnell may have more lenient procedures
than other colleges, but its student drug use is
hardly unusual, Bieniek explained. “I've been
in college for 10 years, either taking classes or
working,“she said. “When it comes to alcohol
and drugs, college is college.”

While the Grinnell Police Department has
processed charges for the students involved,
neither Levin nor Bieniek have heard whether
the college will pursue a Judicial Council hear
ing or further disciplinary action.

Director of campus security Stephen
Briscoe, who was out of town, and Grinnell
Chief of Police Jody Matherly were unavail-
able for comment.

Davis often referred to the longtrunt
