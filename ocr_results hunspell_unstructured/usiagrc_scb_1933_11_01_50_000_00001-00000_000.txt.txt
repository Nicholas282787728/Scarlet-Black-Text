Manuel Brown delivered this week

Christianity.

His antipathy towards the Christian
faithpaccording to the speaker, was
based upon his belief that it robbed
men of their virility through its doc-

in Class Scrap

Flag-Rush Scheduled Friday
Evening on Ward Field

Old clothes, and not too many of
them, will be in order for the fresh-
man-sophomore scrap to be held on
Ward field Friday at 7:30 pm. All
men of both classes, including fresh-

gible.

the top of greased goal posts will be
the program for Friday's contest.

Freshmen have consistently won
the sand bag rushes and tugs»of-vvar

the last few years. It was the fresh-
men who won the sand bag rush of
1930, when one man was knocked un-
conscious for several hours.

The freshman class was again suc—
cessful iu the somewhat milder 1931
contest, twice pulling the sophomore:
through the mud and slimy water of
the pool at the Country club, in three
sessions of tug-of-war.

The ﬂag rush Friday will be the
first class fight for either of the
groups, since the annual scrap was
not held last year.

an even chance to capture their first
game of the season when they play
Carleton college at Northfield, Minn.,

After the shalteup in the lineup for
the Creighton tilt, and the good
showing made in that game, it
seems as if the Grinnell team has at
last hit its stride. The gain from the
change in the lineup resulted from
putting Jim Bradley at a halfback

punting responsibilities. In the game
last week Bradley booted the ball
for a {Seyard average.
