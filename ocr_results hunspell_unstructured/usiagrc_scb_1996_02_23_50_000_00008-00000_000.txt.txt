av BRUCE FRIEDRICH

It seems that the U.S. is at it
again, standing tall for the right of
the rich to dominate the poor. I
don’t have the space to go into the
detail I would like, so let me suggest
afew superb sources, in order: Covert
Action Qdarterly, Winter96; World
OrdersOldandNewbyNoamChorn-
sky, ng Hope by William Blum;
Multinational Monitor, Jan/Feb 95;
2 Magazine, lune 95; The Progres—
sive, Nov 94. The Nation publishes
shorter pieces on Haiti, including
two in Oct 93.

The history in Haiti is a case
study in Adam Smith’s ”vile maxim"
of “all for us and nothing for other
people.” Haiti, at the time ofColum-
bus’ arrival, “was described by the
European conquerors as prosperous,
richly endowed, and densely
populated...now [Haiti is} the very
symbol of poverty and despair”
(Chomsky). In 1521, after the con«
querois had wiped out the indige.
nous population, the first African
slaves were brought to Haiti, In
1791, a slave rebellion was put down
by France, with assistance from the
United States. Hairiwas undetcolo
nial nile until the mid»19th century.

In order to maintain neoecoloe
nial powers in Haiti, the United
States intervened militarily in Haiti
24 times between 1838 and 1914.
on July 28, 1915, President Wilson
invaded Haiti, killing 15,000 Hai-
tians and 14 U.S. soldiers. The U.S.
occupied Haiti until 1934. During
this occupation, theUS. established
the “gendarmerie,” the police force
which continues to keep the country
docile for the multinational corpora-
tions and the 0.8 % of Haiti's popu»
lation who own and run the country
to this day.

This "police force" is trained in
U.S. methods and uses U.S. weap.
ons. Many top officers have trained
in the U.S, and all are fluent in
English; for the past 20 years, the
CIA has paid General Raoul Cedtas
and other Haitian military leaders to
keep track ofpopulat movements in
Haiti. This same structure of power
remains in Haiti, With little change.

Haiti is once again under pute
military occupation by the U.S. mil/
itary, First, the U. orchestrated the
coup to depose Aristide. They
claimed the new government was
under embargo, but it was a total
smoke screen- imports from Haiti
soared after the coup. including a
3.500% rise in food exports from this
starving country: or course, only
Haiti’s ruling class (08%) and US.
multinationals received any of the
profits from this export boon.

Clinton has sent in troops to be
sure that the Lavalas government
(Aristide‘s party) cannot implement
any of the reforms which got him
elected in the first place, Indeed, the
U.S. (with the help ofthe IMF and
World Bank) has imposed the most
radical structural adjustment plan

ever attempted in the world~ “it
involves laying off half of the gov.
ernment employees, privatization of
dozens of functions and serVices of
the government, abandonment of
Aristide's program of doubling the
real minimum wage..,essentially
abandoning the idea of land reform,
creating a whole new court system
that will be more favorable to corpo/
rate interests, and giving special sub»
sidies to export corporations" (Z).

Chomsky explainsthesituation:
“Washington has made clear that
the elected president would be per»
mitted to return...only on the condi»
tion that effective power is placed in
the hands of..,the business sector,
with the popular movements that
swept [Atlstlde] into powerolevasrat.
ed and marginalized." Now, the Lav—
alas platform “doesn’t even talk about
the modest reforms that Aristide at»
tempted during his first period in
government, like the minimum wage,
like social security" (2).

So,theU.S.hasonceagainptov—
enits total dedicationtowhat Chom<
skycalls“thefifthfteedom,"theftee<
dom of the rich nations to rob and
pillage the poor nations. With par—
ticular candor (and racism), Defense

Ma]. Louis Kernisan states: “Who
are we going back to save? You’re
going to end up dealing with the
same folks as before, the five families
which run the country, the military
and the bourgeoisie ..Theyspeakyoiir
language, they understand your sys«
tem, they've been educated in your
country It’s not going to be that
slum guy from Cite Soleil [Aristide]
The best he can hope for is ‘Oh I'll
help you off load your cargo truck.’
Because that’s all he has the capacity
to do."

Orwell spoke of the need for
historical perspective in evaluating
the present, As in every other case
of U.S. intervention, the US, sent
troops to Haiti for purely economic
teasom,tosecutethe"fifthfreedom.“
Clearly, U.S. justification for inter—
vention is specious at best. Press
accounts lack depth and perspective
andhold to the party line fed to them
by government and corporate func<
tionaries.

The latest news from Haiti is
that more than 150,000 pagesofdoc—
uments were seized by U.S. forces
during the invasion in the fall of
1994, ”including at least 150,000
pages of written text. plus Videos.
audiocasscttes and ‘trophy photos’ of
FRAPH Victims”(Nation, 21636)

Disco Fest VII
To the campus community:

As our fourth year of competi»
tive revtling draws to a close this
spring, we've been thinking a lot
about the nature ofour dance, ofoiit
love for our hair, and, most import
tantly. about the many joyous exper
riences we’ve had while shaking our
tushes ‘

Whenwefirstbegalireveliiig,at
the age of 18, we were very inexperi—
enced. A typical evening consisted
ofa lot ofstretching, a few anticipa—
tory pelVKZ thrusts, but little actual
groovingonthe dance floor. Perhaps
we were intimidated by the more
professional artists of frolic who in—
vested little time in stretching and
executed-r116Hustlewlll’iTtﬂVollnP
inn—like precision, or with the grace
of Olivia Newton<lohii However.

when we gained sufficient experi—
ence and confidence we embarked
on what was to be a most memorable
evening, We entered the little»
known Marshalltown Twist-Off and
PigrRme' Contest. Unfortunately,
we arrived too late to participate in
the Twist—Off. but managed a very
respectable second—place finish in the
PigRoptn' competition. If it hadn't
been for those damn bell—bottoms..,

At Disco Fest IV, we played the
role of the student watching the gift-
ed teacher. We didn't think that

such an intense feeling could be pos—

sible. Watching the likes of Mike
Steinberg, Sean Barry, and Eric Gaut—
schi cavort amongst the throngs of
passionate young bodies was truly a
religious experience. However, their
time here at Grinnell was painfully
brief, and, upon their departure, they
passed the torch to us, with only a
few words of adVice: “Men," they
said, "if you stuff your crotches, they
will come.” We had no idea what
they were talking about, but we
thought the ideaofweatingpolyester
and stuffing our crotches was kinda
neat. So we did it.
