plaee showing at the MidweSt Con-
ference Championship meet losing,

Mad Duck tallied a l»2 dual meet
record along with two firsts, a see

This season the swirnmin‘ women
find themselves under the tutelage of
a new coach Ray “Obe” Obermiller,

coach upon the departure of three-

year coach Sheila Cain.

Throughout ftrstsemesrer, theteam
will be slightly shorthanded due to
seven leuer-winners being abroad,
butObermiller maintains that a “verv
satile" class of recruits will keep his
team competitive.

For now though, Mad Duck must
rely on cightretum ing letter—winners,
among whom are senior co-captains
Heather Lange, Amy Oggel, and
Marie Smith.

Obermiller cites the distance
events as Grinnell’s biggest strength
which was obvious last season when

Women's basketball set
for conference chase

By Ben Root

The Grinnell women’s basketball
team won the Midwest Conference
title in 1991. In 19912, they know
that they are [he team eveyone else
will be after.

Coach Ted Eskildsen sees this as
one of the intangibles that is going to
make or break the Pioneers. “How are
we going to react to everyone else’s
biggest game?" he asks.

They are going to react to thechalr
lenges with the same dedication and
hard work that has put the Grinnell
women’s team in the Midwest Con-
ference tournament the last two years.
Eskildsen believes that the team's
style will not have to change that
much to accomplish this goal.

“For us to be effective, we have to
push the ball offensively and play
hard changing defenses. just like we
did last year,“ he said

For the second year in a row
Grinnell has lost the GTE Academic

into the

All-American Player of the year. last
year it was Missy Sharer leading the
nation in scoring at 33 points per
game that characterized the Pioneer
game plan

Eskildsen admits that “when you
lose 33 points. you are going to have
to create some points. But he adds
that “in just that way we are a sur-
prise. How are we going to make up
for losing Sharer?”

The plan will be a balanced score
ing attack with several of the Pio-
neers scoring in double figures.
Esldldsen hopes that this will make
the Learn less predictable and more ‘
consistent.

In looking atpersonncl. Eskildsen
has four solid players who are ca-
pable offitting intoanything the team
wishes to do. Senior] enny Wood and
juniors Amy Fort, Jen Kelley and
Lisa York are all versatile and can
play the two and three positions.
Eskildsen sees the opportunity to al-
ter match-ups at the team’s discre- ‘
tion.

Other returnees who will have an
impact include senior Shannon
Hancock and juniors Tirsit Brooks
and sophomore Allison Wickens.

A slew of first year students com-
plete the roster, including Tari '
Renaud. Carrie Landfried, Beth
Wohlberg, and Victoria Trost. These
newcomers must evolve for the Pio-
neers to have the depth which they -
will need to Carry out their defensive .
strategies.

The prospects are good for the Pior
neers as they go into their first year v
defending a conference champion- ‘
ship. Butas Eskildsen says it is going
“to take persistence to establish the ‘
quality habits that we will need to be r
successful with this group,"
