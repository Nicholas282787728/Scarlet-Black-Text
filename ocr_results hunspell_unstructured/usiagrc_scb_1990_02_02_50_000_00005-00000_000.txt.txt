All 01 G ncll was hushed n
anticipation for the upcoming
match. Students hurried about
quietly, preparing chili and
tapping kegs. It had finally
arrived. January 26 brought us
the i990 SUPERBOWL!

Well.,.maybc I am
exaggerating a little. There were
people at the library. There were
people at the Forum, the Post
Office. and, yes, even in the
laundry rooms. However, there
were others who did celebrate
what has become a day of
tradition: Superbowl Sunday.

“The reason that the Super-
bowl is so great is that people
from all walks of life and all
interests can bond together for a
common cause!” Tolan Steele

Partiers at Brown House celebrated the Superbowl last Sunday.

Bowl. others just wanted to
watch the game.

The mellow. dark atmosphere
of Gates lounge contrasted with
the unbelievable excitement that
built as the first half came to a
close. The spectators yelled and
screamed and threw cheese
popcorn.

“The Superbowl stands for
team spirit, justice—THE
AMERICAN WAY!” Daniel
Bliss cried out. Devin Weeland
commented that the Super Bowl
was “just a good excuse to drink
beer on a Sunday afternoon.”
Others at Gates seemed to agree
with this sentiment as they
staggered out of the lounge
during halfrtimc. Time for

World Bank, and foreign deputy
director of the US. Peace Corps,
spoke on Jan. 29. In her talk,
“The World Bank: Past, Present.
and Future," shc outlined the
activities of the World Bank, and
the fundamentals of“intemational

International economic
development or. “lite orderly flow
of capital from the ‘haves’ to the
‘have-nots‘", as Handwcrgcr put
it, is the goal of the World Ezmk.
The World Bank loans money to
“less developed” countries to did
them in the construction of
productive and . profitable
industrial endeavors.

Handwerger noted that the
World Bank is very curut’ul to
ascertain the economic integrity
of its projects, thereby earning ti
“triple-A“ bond rating. No World
Bank loan has ever defaulted

which the World Bank has been
criticized in the past by the world
cominunity‘.

Lack of concern for the
environment and for “less
developed” cultures existing at
project sites are two issues which
Handwcrger touched upon in lter
tal In response to a question

Handwergcr asserted that “we’re

that this year's Superbowl was
“one last time for us all to enjoy
