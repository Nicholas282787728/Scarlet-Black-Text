Exam Plan

Chances Slim

Possibility of Adequate
Test Slight; Only 2
Classes Favor System

By Arthur Goshorll

Possibilities for an adequate
testing of the new plan for Ilnau»
nounced examinations seem iin-
probable at the present time, a
survey conducted Friday disclosed.

0f the few classes that have
voted on the plan, only one or
two have indicated that it will
be tested.

Factors

Three important factol'sidisap-
proval of the plan by professors,
disapproval by the students, and
impossibility of using the plan
due to the nature of many
courses—appear to be obstacles
to the revision of examination pro
ceedings.

Most senior students are against
the plan since they are not res
quired to take exams in second
semester courses,

Classes Voto

Prof. Earl D, Strong's labor
problems class is the only one
known to have voted in favor of
attemping the plan. Assistant
Professor Milton Wittlet’s educa—
tional psychology class, composed
mostly of seniors, voted heavily
against it.

The business cycles class, con-
ducted by Joseph w. Charlton,
associate professor of economics,
turned down the plan by a 23 to
21 vote and his two beginning
economics classes were so obvi-
ously against the plan that no
vote was taken.

English Sections

According to Henry Alden, lne
structor in English, he will be
unable to give the new plan a
vote in his English literature
class. “The present schedule of
the course makes it too crowded
to install the required number of
unannounced examinations during
the length of a semester Alden
said.

The general opinion of the
faculty seems to be in favor of
allowing the students to try the
plan if the course is such that it
can accept the new system. How»
ever, several of the professors
have stated that they believe un»
announced examinations would
mean much more work for both
students and instructors.
