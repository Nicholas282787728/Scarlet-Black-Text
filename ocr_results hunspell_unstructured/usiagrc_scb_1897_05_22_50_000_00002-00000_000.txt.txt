a}! Elem.

r. linsmmu. team werlt out
for the game yesterday \\itl‘l sans
gnine expectations that tlleil fel-
low students would gladly take
advantage of this opportunity to
show some appreciation oi the
team’s plucky spirit in walking
taithiully against overwhelming
and discouraging odds. In lieu
of such support they were great
ed by a meagre crowd which made
the building at the new gland
stand seem the consummation of
hollow mockery. ina crowd at
a hundred or so, the students were
outnunrbered by townspeople and
strangers anti those who were pl e-
sent were too lonesome to enjoy
the game. No.Grinnell team
evcrrnerited the encouragement
and loyalty oi the students more
than has the baseball [can] the
present season. Handicapped by
faculty action, deprived of the
incentive oian eastern trip, ilnr
peded by unfavorable weather,
the players have gone out in mud
and rain day aitcr day imbued
with the old Grinnell spirit which
wins games when the spectators,
and those who ought to be, show
some traces oi it. They have
worked steadily and uncomplain-
ingly that they might uphold to
the utmost of their ability Grin—
nell’s prestige on the athletic
ﬁeld. and yet when opportunity is
given the students to do their part,
they respond with n stolid indifr
ference which is the hardest test
the team’s pluck has yet suffered.
It may begin to seem monotonous
to have repeated continually that
the college representatives can-
not make creditable showing in
intercollegiate contests without
the united support of the student
body, but it is pro-eminently true,
and its truth will justiiy repetition
until recognized. The Grinnell
spirit has won us our athletic pres~
tige and can alone maintain it,
but irom present indications apr
pools to this spirit will have to
soon be replaced by its epitaph

says at thrs last match: “The
contest between Cornell and Grins
nell was the sensation of the after
noon Tlrcteamswere verycven-
ly matched and it seemed as
though the game was to be mainly
a test oi endurance. Unusually
brilliant playing was done on both
sides. Nearly every game was
made deuce, and from ”no all"
they counted up often to Sound
go, and in one case it was 130 for
the winner. The set was made a
deuce set, and then came the ﬁn

and Beyer. are bcautilul players.
They are easy and gracetnl in
Covering the courts, and Beyer at
net was simply marvelous in his
work. Nothing seemed to get
through his racket. He was iaulty
in returning too low and many
blilliant returns were lost in this
manner. Blatherwick as a sewer
seemed to have an inexhaustible
supply oi twists and curves, coup-
led with a sniitness that was some-
thingtcrrinc. Undcrhantlorover—
hand, serve or return. he was al-
ways the same, and his game was
without many errors. The Cor-
ncll team was put upon diticrcnt
lines. They played a ﬁerce, quick
game. and were expert in placing
the balls where their opponents
could not ﬁnd them. They were
both lively men and at net no lob
was too lllgh nor any vollcy too
swrit to pass them. They were
agile as cats and seemed to be at
allplacesatthesamctimc. They
served a hartl ball and cut their
serves in a wicked manner that
often sent them along the ground
with scarcely a perceptrble
bound."
