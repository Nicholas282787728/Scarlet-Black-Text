Students raise draft worries

by Jim Goodietiow

Students gathered Tuesday in South
Lounge in order to exchange views on
draft registration. Chaplain Dennis
Hans and RAs Barb Gaddis and Jeffrey
Montague called the meeting “to deter-
mine what the needs are on campus
concerning draft registration," Haas
said.

Haas expressed an interest in “sitting
down with anyone having questions
about his registration status.” Gaddls,
Haas, and Montague want to talk with
those who did not register and uncer»
tain loyearolds who must register in
January.

Gaddjs addressed the need to reach
those who are uncertain about the draft
and their status. ”There are a lot of peo-
ple who are having trouble deciding
what to do. I want to help them sort out
their thoughts more clearly."

Haas emphasized the need for anyone
considering conscientious objector
(CO) status to clarify their personal
position. ”If they think they quality as
Co’s, then they should sort things out."
individuals would have only in days to
complete conscientious objector peti-
tion forms in the event of a draft.

The student discussion centered on
the decision not to register and the
possible consequences of that decision.
One student compared the decision
criteria of his friends. ”’A lot of my
iriends registered this summer even
though they opposed it. They simply
didn't want to {ace the possible conse
quences of not registering. One person
in particular I know registered because
it’s the law."

This student did not register, “It was

(not to register. The difficult deci-
siqn,was how to go about it. Should I
openly protest or just go to work and
forget about it?"

One student stressed that the
registration decision should be an in-
formed one. “We need to try to educate
freshmen about the registration. Many
I’ve talked with tail to understand fully
its relation to the draft."

Students discussed the consequences
of not registering in terms of enfors
cabllity. Some shared the opinion that
the selective service legislation was not
easily enforcable, They reasoned that
the presidential election. a possible
Supreme Court ruling, and questions
concerning the workability of enforces
merit provide protection at present.

One student felt that the government
would crack down after the election. "I
don‘t think there’s anything in ior those
who didn’t register now, but after the
election federal agents will be tracking
us down.”

The students agreed that this period
of no enforcement must be utilized.
“Given the unknowns, any eniorcement
policy could materialize. But people
must register now. This is the time that

people must decide what, it anything,
they are going to do,"

Students expressed a desire to raise
the level oi registration consciousness
on campus and in the Grinnell coms
munlty. Two students participated in
drait counseling training programs last
summer. Some students may attend a
counseling workshop sponsored by the
Iowa Peace Network (IPN) in
November. Haas, Gaddis, and Man
tague’ attended an IPN workshop last
spring

12-18 is National Anti-Draft Week. The
week will culminate Oct, 18 with a
march through Des Moines to the
governor's mansion and a speaker pro
gram. The group encourages anyone in
terested to attend,

The balls start rolling

by Bob Klelne

with the signup deadlines now past,
ping pong and billiard balls will soon be
ponging and popping at the Forum. It’s
time for the annual Fall Eight Ball and
Ping Pong Tournament!

Forty students are registered for the
pool singles tournament and 20 teams
are registered for doubles competition.
Jon Higgins, ’80, won the singles
torunament last fall and the team of
Higgins and Barry Huff was victorious
in doubles action.

Thirtyone students have signed up
for the singles ping pong tournament
and eight teams have signed up for
doubles action. Joe Chow, '80, won the
single: tournament last fall and the
team of Kurt Carver and Joel Robbins
reigned supreme in doubles.

in both tournaments the winners are

given their very own certificate signed
by George Drake attesting to the fact
that they are indeed the champions.

Jenny Erickson, director of the
Forum, pointed out that the tour
namanet listings will be posted across
from the Forum desk. Anyone in-
terested in the progress of the tourna-
ment should check there. She also noted
that the championship matches in both
tournaments will be announced in the
Memo.

So good luck to all participatns.
Anyone could win. Pool players, in par-
ticular, can find comfort in the fact that
Dave McConnell (Yes, that handsome
director of Food Service) won the
billiards tournament one year! That
should provide encouragement for even
the clumsy stick wielders,

Students form food coop

by Wendy Babbitt

Due to the initiative of several Grin-
nell students, an alternative means of
purchasing food now exists [or offs
campus students. faculty, and coop
house dwellers

This alternative, The Grinnell Buying
Club, is a food collective run solely by
Grinnell students for the college com-
munity. A venture independent of the
college, the club is a part of an Iowa Cir
ty food collective called Blooming
Prairie Warehouse lnc.

Although individual students have
been purchasing goods from Blooming
Prairie since 1e75, it was not until last
January that students collaborated and
formed a club. Club members order
food through a contact person from the
college community. That person then
purchases the food in bulk quantities.
Examples of the food offerings include

\

staples such as iloui. iicc, beans,
cheese, yogurt. peanut butter, honey,
oats, and many other items except
fresh produce,

According to current contact person
Sydney i-ienthorn. she chose to buy food
from Blooming Frame for many
reasons Although she admits that the
collective is cheaper, she says her main
reason is that the food is better. She
describes the items as being
"organically grown, not pasteurized by
a large monopoly." She deems this iood
as “the food of consciousness,"

“Today. people don't have a sense or
control over their food and where it
comes from," she remarked. The club
is now in the process of reorganizing
their buying process so that more peo
ple will participate. This should result
in a more cooperative policy towards
ordering food. ‘
