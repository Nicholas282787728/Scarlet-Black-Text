After two ymrs at the University of Iowa and anodier two at Grinnell, Ben
Meade ‘01 slill thinks ofhimsclfus a ru. The term is short forgum and refers to
members oi the ti-unsmndeiital meditation (TM) movement. Meade coma:
from dirt Hindu community oanitﬁeId, Iowa, where he lived from kindotgsre
ten thiou$ high school, studying at the Maharishi School of die Age of En-
lighteiiment.

Asked to charactclio: hilnsclfin terms ofusliglon, Made snid, “I often say
I’m a Jewish Christian Hindu, Wind] is tnie. My mom was raised Jewish, Ded
was raised Christian, and I was raised in Win! I essentially drink ofas being
Hindu commututy,"

TM is type otinedimtian pmclicc, Meade said, “Essentially, it's just sitting
and repeating a mantis. You repeat the mum]: and me daeory is that you're
going widiiii yotirselr, you're eontarting die source orell eteauon e the iaipiral
S: Sell! die transcendental. You repeat the mnnm to the pomlatwhich them
is no mantra, there is no self,"

Although Meade has lth the'l‘M commu'nity, it is still very much it pm of
him. Mmtl: is graduaiing with an independent inaioe ieligion and liteiatuie.
His senior ihesis presenrniion was entitled “Lietving Utopia: An Aiitohiograplu.
ml PCISPCCUVC on the Transsendcntal Mediation Movement." Mad: Feels that
developing an independent major was deﬁnitely part of pursuing his peisonal
path towmd enlightenment “ltwas tonstrueted [to help me] on my path and it
was really valuable in doing so," he said “I’ve been very honest about my up.
bringing" .and trying to nailly put me at the center orit. lm not trying to do
something ihat's totally ohyeetive l m necessarily admowledging that lm doing
something diets fairly subjective—how these diings are ineorpoiated into me.

lnteneting with Hindu students on tampus has added a new perspeetive,
Meade said Most ofthe Hindu studens here are Hindu mainly by culture, not
by religion, so it hss been intemung to share eultuml expeiieneos oinnduism.
“Theyareeertain things that wean relate to with raidi ouier, Like theooneept
oijotjsh. It'stssenrjaily rortunoteuing. hutvve pura littlehit more helietinto it."
While most people here would see this ides as pure dogma, Made said, other
Hindus understand and share Made’s belief in jyotish.

For the ﬁlm, Made has annsidcmd both law school and journalism. His
father is z hoe-lance writer, so Meade said he undetsmnds bodi the adwnuga
and disadvanmges ofbeirlg a writer. I dorlr have some romantieiaed notion of
whatwriung is; I also rooognize diet you have to make money doing it.

A major part orMeade's senior presentation was autohiognphiral ertaisve

pmenl literature on die TM mov:ment. “The academic stulf that has boon
done [on the memheis ofthe TM movement] is not popular enough so dist
people will be able to oenneet to it. It also is not humanizing," Meade said
“Were still seeing them as ohieets orstudy. I think it‘s very valuable to see
