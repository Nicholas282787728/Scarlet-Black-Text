Oiiice. This is courtesy of me, and I would
like to say hello. my first oiiicial hello as
Grinnell College Scarlet and Black Sports
Editor.

How did I get this J0b7 Well, when Justin
decided he wasn't going to do this job this
semester. they asked me ii I wanted to.
Obviously. I answered yes, or I wouldn’t be
here right now

Why did I want this job" Well, I had such
a blast last semester doing the dorm series
and other Infamous things that I decided
being an editor would be even more furl
And a challenge And I might even learn
something. Plus. I LIKE sports; I always
have I played football withtlie kids on my
block when I was growing up; I like race

quetball and badminton (yes. that IS a
sport); and I‘ve played in a lot ol I.M.
games this year. I was on my high-school
swim team Ior three years ttri-captained
it as a seniorl. and I ran track as a
sophomore. I used to play Parks and Rec
basketbaqll, too. And that's about the end
oi my credentials.

Radical change oisubiect Why read the
sports page oi the s and Is? Well, you
might be on a team. it's Iun lo see your
name in print. or the name oisomeoiie you
know tAnother way to get your name lIl
print is to WRITE for the S iind l5, hint

meet. but couldn't make it for some
reason. you can iind out what the score
was and What went on Things like that.

and 50 free.

The Pioneers look ahead to the second
semester “They're really excited about
how well we've done so far." Rowedder
commented “I think we've surprised a
iew people I'm really pleased with the
way things are shaping up '3

There was no concern about a close con-
test last weekend as the Women Pioneers
won their own Grinnell Invitational by a
comlortable 52-point spread. The winners
scored 218 points. followed by Coe with 156.
Luther With 100. and Buena Vista 32.

it is no surprise that Rowedder was
pleased with the win. but she was
somewhat surprised by the scoring
margin “We did pretty well tor the point
we're 'n the season.” she commented.
adding. “i expect similar times in the next
icw weeks because we've been working so
hard."

Depth again was a key iactor in Grinnell
scoring. as they had just one iirst place--
ireshman Colleen Murphy in one-meter
