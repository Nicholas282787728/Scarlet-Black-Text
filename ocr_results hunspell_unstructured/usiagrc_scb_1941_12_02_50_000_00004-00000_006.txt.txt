 

DURING the 1941-42 school year about 500,000 different students are
being employed on the NYA student work program. The wages they
earn mean the difference between their being able to stay in school and con-
tinue their education and dropping out.

These students are enrolled in 28,000 high and other secondary schools
and 1,700 colleges and universities located throughout the continental
United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. All of the participating
schools and colleges are bona fide, lax»zx2mpl, non-profit-making institu-
tions. Some are publicly controlled while others are privately controlled.

Educators in the various schoolvand colleges are mainly responsible for
administration of the student work program. They select the students on the
basis of proven need and demonstrated scholastic ability ~ no student be-
ing eligible for an NYA job who cannot perform or maintain satisfactory
scholastic work in three-fourths of a normal curriculum. The school officials
plan the projects on which the students work —— care being taken to find use-
ful jobs which are of value to the students and do not displace regular 2m»
ployees of the institution. Students are assigned, wherever possible, to
projects that are in line with their major interests and aptitudes. Pictures on
this and the opposite page illustrate the variety of [obs students perform.
