ORAKE TRIUMPHS
IN FAST BATTLE

BY IO-II OOUNT

Inability to Cake Ball
Costs Pioneers
Victory.

Inability of the Pioneer team to
make good on shots thrown from
short range gave Drake's basketball

_ quintet an 18 to 11 victory over the
Grinncll tosscrs on the local door last
night. The game was fast and fur-
ious throughout, and gave evidence of
the intense rivalry between the two
teams.

The jinx element entered into the
Pioneer defeat to a great extent, as
it seemed impossible for the Pioneer
forwards to make the he'll go through
the hoop, Time after time tlrc'hall
wavered on the rim, or struck the
backboard only to bounce off the edge
of the basket. On the other hand,
the Drake forwards were unable to
toss the hall anywhere within the
vicinity of the hoop without counting
2/ng1. .

Drake Strong on Defense.

Despite the luck element, Drake
must be given credit for having the
best team it has put on the Pioneer
tloor for man years.

and worked together better than did
the Pioneer quintet. V‘Vhilc the Grill-
nell team appeared to be better than
Drake on defensive work, the Des
Molnes aggregations offense worked
to better advantage than did the Pio-
neer scoring machine.

During the lirst few minutes of play
neither team was able to score, due
to the excellent guarding of both lives,
coupled with fast floor work. Evans
dropped in the ﬁrst ﬁeld goal of the
evening near the middle of the half,
and T. Payseur retaliated soon after
with a shot from the side of the
court. The Pioneers were unable to
count again during the ﬁrst half, al.
though they had almost twice as many
chances at the hoop as did Drake. The
score at half time was s to 2 in favor
of Drake.

Stage Comeback.

The Pioneers came back with a
rush in the second half, and threat-
ened to tie the count when Shoesmith
gathered two baskets near the he-
glnning of the period. Two long shots
by Shawver put Drake out of danger
for the time. and Payseur added an-
other goal with a sensational shot
from long range. Shoesmith gathered
his third basket of the half for two
more points, besides tossing in one
foul goal. Grinnell's remaining two
points were the result of a ringer by
Daubcnberger, who was injected into
the lineup near the end of the half.
Brindley, a former Grinnell man, was
responsible for Drake's dual field goal

Few Fouls Called.

Although the contest was exceed-
lgly fast, very few fouls were called,
Drake being penalized six times and
Grinnell four times. Both teams made
substitutions during the latter part of
the game.

For Grinnell, Shoesmith at forward
showed up best in both scoring and
ﬂoor work. All of his scoring was
done in the second half. Daubehherg—
er, substituted at center in the last
few minutes of play, also appeared to
advantage, gathering ane goal during
the time he was in. Payseur of the
offensive and Ebert on the defensive
were the outstanding Drake stars, the
former having three goals to his cred-
it. all of them from long range: Ebert
also aided the offense by frequent
rushes into Pioneer territory.

STUDENT BECI’I‘AL WEDNESDAY.

There will be a student recital Wed-
nesday night, in Herrick chapel, at
7:15.

All of the men.
were veterans of two and three years‘

A search is still being Carried on
for clues in the shooting-fray staged
in the rear of the Quadrangle early
this morning. The stories of thc few
girls who watched the battle are all
agreed that of the three men seen
shooting, one of them was hurt. This
theory is further borne out by blood—
stains on the snow near the honor “."G

From the information that cuuld be
secured today, the affair started at
about. midnight, with shooting at the
north end of Cottagc v.

Running Brittle.

In Zl running battle, during which
some dozen shots were exchanged be-
tween the three combatants, the ﬁrst.
man was seen to run south to the walk
back of Central cottage, Where he
dropped and started to are.

The second man followed almost in
the tracks of the ﬁrst and crossed the
walk, going some ﬁfteen met before
he was shot. He dropped imnledir
ately. His assailant was heard to axe
claim, "My God, I've got him.” He
ran to the fallen man and dragged

him away.

The alarm was turned in to the po-
lice Who discovered blood stains and
traces of a struggle.

College Students?

One theory is that the affair was
staged by college students to frighten
the girls. One girl said that she disA
inctly heard the men laughing from
dcross the tracks. it is also said that
the man who fell appeared'to drop be—
fore thc shot which was supposed to
have hit him was ﬁred.

A report from examination of the
stains shows them to be blood instead
of paint as was at ﬁrst suspected. A
probable theory is that the mail was
shot by mistake. This is supported
by the exclamation of the assailant,
which was heard by the girls immedi-
ately lifter the shooting.

The only clue which has been dis-
covered is it. may glove, which was
picked up by one or the girls early to-
day, near the scene of the shooting.

Inquiry at the hospitals failed to re-
veal filly suspicious injuries.

With the exception of the most High

Purple School to Send Team Here
For Battle i 009 Here
Friday.

With the booking of Cornell for a
game here Friday, liar-ch 5, Grinnell's
1920 basketball schedule was complet-
ed this week. Washington University
will play the Pioneers here Friday,
January 30 instead of Saturday, Janu-
ary 31, as the bikers are scheduled to
battle Drake at Des Moines the last
day of the month.

One College. will battle the Pioneers
here next Wednesday. this being the
next contest on the Grlnncll 1920 has»
kethall schedule.

According to Mount Vernon fans,
their team this year is the fastest live
Cornell has ever had, The team has
already defeated the University roll
iowa quintet three times, and the Knox
college live, once. The team is made
up of such veterans as Kepler, Lemon,
Hurlburt, Sanderson. and Hoadley.
These players were on the football
eleven which held Grinneil to a o to i
tie on ward held in November.

Playing the Pikcrs one day sooner
than was expected will notchange the
date of the mid-semester dance, which
will be held February 1 instead of
January 31, the usual time. Not much
has been heard of the St, Louis aggre—
gation as yet, but local fans believe
that Washington University has a
fairly strong basketball five.

Prof. Sheldon Back
From Leave Tuesday

Professor Caroline Sheldon, of the
French department, will arrive in
Grinnell Tuesday to resume her work
according to a letter rec'elved here
this week. Miss Sheldon has been
away from Grinnell this semester on
a leave of absence and has spent most
of her time doing research work at
Columbia University.

Are Group Patterns
Forced 0n Dormites?

The danger in every large group of
students, such as those in the men's
and Women’s dormitories is that
group patterns are forced on
them instead of letting t h t
individual work out his own indi-
viduality, according to Professor J. D.
Stoops in his talk on “Gregztl'iousness
and Individuality" at Y. M. C. A.
Thursday night. This statement was
his answer to the question, "Does the
grouping in buildings help to build
our individuality or not?”

“The old college was more like a
family" and he believes that it is now
becoming a college corporation, each
building and cottage having its own
life. ‘

Dr. Dodge To Hold _
Life Work Conferences

Rowland n. Dodge of the Pacino
School of Religion, will be here Mon.

It‘s white. It’s flufiy. It's about

there will be no general skating on

or more. Here's the story:

Repeated attempts to flood the rink
have failed because when the embank-

ders were used, and cinders won't hold
water. Early this week the Iceland-

Peculiar noises and shrieks of

But why these peculiar actions? ‘Tis
this: a few of the girls, who tip the

.Train Wrecks Car at
West Street Crossing

Charles Lincoln was severely injur-
ed and his automobile almost com»
pletely wrecked this morning when
Rock Island train No. a struck the
car at the West street crossing this
morning.

Mr. Lincoln, who barely escaped
with his life, is resting easily at the
Community hospital. He was severely
cut about the head, and his arms and
legs were badly bruised.

Mr. Lincoln was driving north and
the train was pulling in from the
west. It is thought that the slippery
condition of the road was responsible
for the accident. The car was struck
in the middle and is a complete loss.
The windshield is the only part that
was not damaged. Mr. Lincoln is a
farmer who lives south of town.
