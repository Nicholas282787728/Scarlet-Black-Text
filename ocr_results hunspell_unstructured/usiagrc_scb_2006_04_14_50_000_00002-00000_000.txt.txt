Smith: Group’s ideas not asked for
Forum, cont. from p. I

In order to maintain the Forum as a coffee stop, the archi-
tects have included plans for a coffee and hot water station.
Because the building will undergo no structural changes, the
Forum will not be made ADA compliant.

Not everyone on campus is pleased that ITS is going to be
using the Forum at all. A Forum Group was formed to discuss
potential uses for the building, but member Don Smith, I-Iise
tory, said that their conclusions weren’t taken into account or
even asked for.

“We were awaiting the time when the question ofwhat fur
ture of the Forum would be," said Smith. “We could then say
‘Well, here are ideas that we have come up'with.m

That time never came.The decision was made without con-
sulting the Forum Group, whose ideas included office space
for professors, interdisciplinary centers and temporary art gale
leries.

“I think it is a mistake to conceive of[the Forum] as a facil-
ity which ought to be adjusted to whatever temporary or inter
mediate range purposes the college has in mind," smith said. “I
always favored building a new ITS building for ITS."

The ﬁnal plans for the Forum will not be confirmed for
another month, The latest layout by the architects is available
for viewing in the SGA Coordinator's office in the basement
of the Forum. ,

Is the Environmental Project ‘wasteful' 'or revolutionary?

Rainfarext, cant. from p. I

to maintain the Project’s environment5.~

The final site for the Project will not be chosen for several
weeks or monthsThe Project is currently communicating with
the finalists, giving them access to currently conﬁdential plan-
ning information and soliciting plans or providing financial
and logistical support. Oman said that ﬁnalists will be judged
on four criteria:

' How much land is offered

- The quality of the site, including topography, ambience
and noise

- Access to both transportation and to complementary edus
calicnal facilities

. Local financial assistance, up to around $25 million

The Project had settled on Coralville as its location. Dur»
ing the time—two yearsithat Coralville was the choice, the
city spent millions of dollars on improvements. After problems
arose, the Project reopened the process to other communities.

The location proposed by Grinnell is 160 acr_es near Inter-
state 80, in the Lang Creek Crossing development. Oman said
that Interstate noise was one problem with the Coralville site,
but he said that Grinndl's location was large enough that the
dome could be set back from the Interstate.

Critics have lampooned the Project as a prime example of

ﬂ,

-The SGA Joint Board reform proposal was brought before
the board.The proposal will add a second SGA vice president
in charge of Student Afraiis, leaving the SGA president to for
cus on Institutional Planning instead. The board seemed split
on whether this was necessary and when it should be decided.

- After the recent vandalism of the Campus Center, Direct
tor of Security Steve Briscoe suggested closed-circuit cameras
to protect the college and the students from miscreants. There
would be a panel established to prevent abuse oftlrc cameras.

- A resolution was intioduced to create a committee to
advise the Trustees on investing Grinnell's endowment in a
socially responsible fashion, The proposal also called for this
committee to be given access to information on the Trustees'
investment practices. ﬁrmpilrd by Merrick Mcynr

congressional pork. Tom Finnegan, spokesman for the watch
dog group Citizens Against Government waste (CAGW),
said that the Project didn’t go through the proper authorization
process. Most importantly, it has never been the subject of a
congressional hearing.

“The project may or may not have merits," Finnegan said.
"That's why there's a process in place to determine which proj-'
ects the government should be funding. once that becomes
violated, then the door’s thrown open to all sorts of wasteful
projects." ‘

A spokesperson for senator Grassley disagreed. “The mone
ey appropriated was done with bipartisan support," said Beth
Pellett Levine by email. "Senator Grassley strongly believes
in the project and has always been convinced of the benefits
to Iowa. [He] will always listen to Iowans before a lobbying
organizations like [CAGW].”

Oman also defended the lavishness ofthe project. ”Ifyou're
pushing the envelope, doing something that’s never been done,-
you’re going to get questions," he said. “We’re not building a

ox a sports arena or a shopping mall Some people are gee
ing to be skeptical, and we accept that."

Oman said that the Eden Project in the U. K. received about
50 percent of its funding from the British government. while
the Environmental Project’s grant only covers about onesthird
of total costs.
