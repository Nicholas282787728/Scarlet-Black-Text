An‘ Interesting Year

The underclassmen are gone. By li’londay, most of the
seniors will be gone. And the \' lr 19 Si is gone, too.

It's been a pretty good year. We’ve accomplished some
things, and missed on others. We‘re‘learned some thingsand
forgotten some. We’ve watched activities develop, and
wither away.

Debate, for example, has certainly developed. Most of the i
credit for developing an active intramural program and for”

,building the intercollegiate team into one that missed by a
hair reachingr the finals for tile West Point tourney (the
Rose Bowl of debating) goes to Nicholas Cl'ipe.

The Student Council has had a year unlilfe ally before in
our memory. «It sponsored an economic boycott of the col—
lege laundry early ill the year that accomplished its pur-
pose, and it wollnd up the year entangled in probably the,
strangest mass of facts, statistics, opinions, etc,, that hasl
ever been compiled by the council on one questionithef
ear rule. . ‘

And we have seen the cut rule, the course plan, the3
grading system all change before our eyes. ‘

It’ll talie only one day's confinement for illness next yearl
to receive excuses for classes missed, and the dean’s list‘
(whatever lat will be under the grading system) won’t be

under the rule at all. Joseph Wall and his committee, a coin—
billation of personnel board and Student Council members,
did the‘work andmade the recommendations responsible
for a more sensible rule, 1 _ ‘ >

Some activities have been slow, or have stopped altogeth—

time last fall. No one really remebers \lheil. IRC, an
important group on other campuse, marked tinie th year,
and holds fond hopes of a reV Ya1 of interest ne fall.
Canter club’s activities have expanded, and the group is
looking ahead towards a bigger and better year.

Yes, a pretty good year. In fact, a good senior class to
