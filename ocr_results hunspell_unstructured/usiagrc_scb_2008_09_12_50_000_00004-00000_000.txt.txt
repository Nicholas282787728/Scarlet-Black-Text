Is China a superpower? will it become a
major superpower in the near future?

Even it you were to think that is
possiblcoiwhich I'm not sure I
doiyou would have to rliink rcr
ally long term, Growth rates [in
China] are amazing, but still were
not at that point where China to»
places a superpower or becomes a
superpower around the world.

That's not to say China is not
an important country, and that
they won’t become an important
country Their importance will
only increase. And the key is ﬁguring out
how to make that [rise coincide] with US
objectives, world objectives, and making the
world better off for everybody. And I think
that that is distinctly possible and in every
one‘s interest.

Will Tibet serve as an impediment to bi»
lateral UiSrChina relations?

I think that eventually everyone will come
to better terms in Tibet. It’s certainly not
the situation we want to see right now. Even
given how many of our interests are consoc
nant between the US and China. there are
going to be issues that we disagree on; deals
ing with Tibet is going to be one ofthose. .

I don't believe Tibet should be an inde
pendent country, hurl think that given its
history, there needs to be a greater focus on
some autonomy, or some system where the
Tibetans get a larger saying in how they are
managed and governed. I think the inter»
national community should continue to put

I don‘t tllink that it will be it huge ims

is going to be continually be biought up her
rween China and many eouiuiies iii rhe rest
of the world.

Which is good, right?

Absolutely There is no reason ro shy

away from issues where we disagree. \Nc all

are mature enough countries to

be able to agree with the {net that

rliere are some things we agree

on, some things we don’t. And

A I would argue the US doesn’t do

itself any justice ifwe don't stand

I in and stand up for principles and

for people around the world. so

we have to do it. We all have to

be mature enough on both sides

to say that this doesn't encapsulate the an,

tirety of the relationship, and that we can

disagree on things while agreeing on other
things and moving forward.

Will the presidential election of Obama
or McCain make a difference [for relations
with China]?

I think in the end, no. From whntI know
about people who are advising both eantlie
dates, they appieeiate what's at stake, what
there is to gain. and the threats and opportur
nities. It doesn't divide equally along Repubc
lican and Democratic lines. There are people
on both sides who see value in a constructive
relationship with China,and rhere are people
on different sides of the parties that don’t for
various reasons, It will depend much more
on the people that are put in place and on
some orrhe events that happen. 1 don't see
China as a major issue in the election,

spoken on the human rights issue...

I think a President Obamn and ii Presi‘
dent McCain would both be outspoken on
human rights, and it's right to be. I also think
they would both look and say we have to be
able to deal with China on more than just
one issue, whntcvcr thar one issue may be.
Even if it's a cooperative issue, we need to
be able to look at the full range of things to
support and things to press on.

How signiﬁcant were the Olympics to
China's global rise?

I think it’s hard to say. I think that’s one
orthose big questions we will look back on.

from p. 1

BEN BREWER
i think if you would have asked, how monus
mental were the Olympics for South Korea,
people tie that to a huge amount to [South]
Korcas integrating itself inro the global sys-
tem.I think China is there already, in terms
ofbcing integrated in the global system, bur
the Olympics showcased that to a [great] ex-
tent.

In and of itself the Olympics does noth-
ing. But all of the other things that the
Olympics brings with it, the attention, the
recognition, will have an effect and I think
it may hasten some of the integration even
more.

The start of the year has seen a relatively high number of
problematic incidents with students and alcohol. In the first two
weeks of school, there have been three alcoholrrelated arrests and
five hospitalizations clue to alcohol according to Student Affairs.
The hospitalizations are more than name the usual amount. but
the number of arrests is typical, according to Student Affairs and
Campus Security representatives, Administrators and students
alike are concerned with this type ofstart to the year. “Ifstudcnts
are getting to the point of being arrested or needing an ambu-
lance, what aren’t their friends doing)" Greene said,

But Greene and Burrows do not see these recent incidents as
requiring a complete overhaul of the self-governance system.

Both Greene, who began working at Grinnell two months
ago, and Houston Doughnrry, who staired as vice-piesident (oi
