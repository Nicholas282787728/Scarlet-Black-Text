On Being Sociable

A few years from now the word stag
will again mean “male deer." Such is our
predicition, after reading the new novel,
nSonic Extinct Stags I Hare Known", by 2-1
dejected VGrinnellian. The species is rapidly
becoming extinct in this area, open season
having been declared on all males who drag
themselves to dances unaccompanied. This
is a catastrophe! .

And why‘.7 Why is it, ladies and gentle-
men, (we use the term loosely) that a fel-
low can’t go to a dance all by his lonesome
and have a halfway decent time? Why is
it that in order to exist in the amazing
web of social activities which engulf the
Grinnell campus, a man has to sell his soul
to a woman and "go steady" in order to
live“! Are we at the point where, unless
couples pair off the first few weeks of
school. (pardon me. college) no one stands
a chance?

Unfortunately for all, a system of dat-

eRlNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ing intrigue has arisen here, under whose
codes people just don’t go to functlons by
themselves, although they may want to.,’
That blood-cul'dling look a man receives asl
he gently taps another is enough to send
any regular to the showers: Alas, poor stag
line, I’ve had it, Horatio!

Maybe we’re wrong, but we see noth-
ing improper in either fellow or girl show-
ing up at some social activities with no
one in tow. In fact, unless a couple is fairly
serious, engaged, or mar ed (heaven for-
fend!) we are of the opinion that fiancee
cutting is not only proper, but deslrable.
Give the poor gal a bl‘eakishe may be just
as fed up with listening to you talk, as you
are with her long reign of silence! And
don't wol‘ryislie’ll be back in a few min».
utes.

While on the subject of dance niceties,
we might mention the quaint customs of
couple exchanging dances, and the one
which calls for some of the men to dance
with the chaperones. These notions are not
too decrepit to still apply.

Tomorrow night the women’s halls will
play host to anyone who shows up. That’s
all brother. Show up!

Yells Bells l

Last week, in the Grinnell—Kncx foote
ball game, there numerous Scarlet and
Black clad men getting- bruised, beaten and
broken for Grinnell college and its students

Last week there were student specta»
tors in the stands who were proud of these
men~proud because they fought and won.

However. there was an obvious discrepe
ancy in the standsione noticed by players,
coaches, and many students. Will this dis-
crepancy disappear tonight in the Pioneer»
Fighting Scot game? WILL GRINNELL

ATE WITH THE CHEERLEADERS in giv-
ing their vocal support to the Pioneers. This
is a serious matter. The remedy for the sit-
uation is simple, Yell louder and longer.

Speaking about more. Bill

Talking about flying, Dick and
Joan Hebson got the bird, stark,
