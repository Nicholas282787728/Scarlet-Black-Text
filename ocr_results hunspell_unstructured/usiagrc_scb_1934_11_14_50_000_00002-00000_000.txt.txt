PRIVILEGE, NOT OBLIGATION

A new stepfor international peace is launch-
ed forward this week by the Grinnell college
students, once more Pioneers in fact as well as
in name, and the colleges of the mid-west in the
fourth annual Conference on International Rela—
tions. Grinnell’s initiative in the great drive for
disarmament has grown into an admired example
for the colleges and universities of the state to
follow. Working on the assumption that it is the

,youth of America, those who will have to fight
the next war, who must demand and bring about
international peace, the Grinnell conference was
started four years ago. And this year, dele—
gates are expected to arrive from nine states
to take part in the peace parley.

Following on the heels of Armistice day, the
Grinnell conference is intended for action. It is
an attempt to educate the students of the colleges
that preparedness can only lead to another war,
that a new war is not inevitable if the youth of
the world will bend their every effort to the cause
of world peace, and that, as Nicholas Murray But-
ler recently stated, “There is one, and only one,
path of progress, one way to escape the appalling
situation which now surrounds us. And that is
that men and governments should keep their word,
that the disarmament pledge of the Treaty Vera
sailles must be kept."

The importance of the Grimell conference
need not be urged on the delegates who will at—
tend this week. For them its importance is suf»
ficient to draw them from hundreds of miles
around. Their time and their money, they know,
is not spent for an unworthy cause. But, the im-
portance of it must be urged on the students of
the college whose name it bears. Grinnell students
commonly fail to walk a mere block to hear speak—

that conference delegates come a hundred or
more miles to hear.

Since the conference is sponsored by Grinnell
college, it should be enthusiastically supported by
the school. The matter with which it deals is so
vital to every one that it should be unnecessary to
urge attendance at its sessions, If the Grinnell
students will but stop to consider a moment,
they will quickly appreciate that participation in
the conference is in no wise an obligation, but a
very genuine privilege.

AROUND THE CORNER“

It’s a long road that has no turning,” or. “All
things have an end," might well apply to our own
rejuvinated football team, now definitely reinstate
ed in the hearts of Grinnell football fans as well
as in the respect of other schools. Of course, all
Grinnell knows that the students never really lost
hope in the fighting Pioneer eleven, nor did other
colleges lose their respect for the players who
carried the banner of the scarlet and black.
Despite repeated setbacks and despite an unfair
percentage of “bad breaks,” both the coaches and
the team have kept their courage and worked
steadily toward the happy turning.

Not only does the chalking up a win register

a turn for Grimell. The fact that nearly 40 fresh

man players are in uniform, the number of which

Anot to mention their reputations, means greater

Ivope for a continued uptrend in Grinnell grid
5.

;a ll gridders! No longer need Grinnell
stands simply “love thee in defeat," but since the
corner has been rounded they can likewise, “cheer
for thee in each victory.“

THE PEACE TO END WAR

At 11 o'clock of last Sunday, the world stood
silent for a moment as a tribute to the ending of
the greatest of all wars. But it would seem that
this bit of hallowed ceremony is but a hollow
mockery—a thing which men observe for mere
outward appearance, for deep in nanny hearts was
the conviction that in spite of the war to and
wars, we are soon to be plunged once more into
armed conflict.

Accordingly, many men and women from
their places in the business house, the legislative

hall, and the home say that to talk of peace is
sheer folly, that armed preparedness is the only
course. They point out that militarism dominat-
es Europe and the Far East. They say that
while lip service is paid to peace, the nations
are preparing for war. We see that the nations
defeated in the last war are living the ideal of
avenging their defeats. With existing conditions,
they ask, how can we talk of peace?

We are suffering from a philosophy of des—
pair. We do not want War but it is apparently
inevitable, so we are willing to prepare for it,
It is this that is undermining our peace move-
ments and our attempts at disarmament. It is
this which has weakened the League of Nations
to such an extent that its actions are largely
futile.

But war is not the avenue of escape from
economic depression; for history has proved that
war prosperity is only temporary, and that in its
wake follow severe economic and social upsets.
To plunge the world into another chaos is cer-
tainly not .the way to release it from its present
tumultuous condition We cannot find the solu—
tion to our problem in war.

It is in comhatting the spirit of disillusion-
merit and escape at any cost that the Grinnell
peace conference and similar parlies will do their
most valuable work. Men‘s minds grow dull
and cease to comprehend at endless prating of
the horrors of war. We must create a militant
spirit of peace in order to effectively oppose the
idea of the inevitibility of international conﬂict.
We must show that world peace is more disirable
economically, socially, and from a humanitarian
standpoint than war. Only in this way can a
“peace to end war” he established,

THE CATS EAT THE RATS, AND .

A few years ago millions of newspaper readv
ers smiled condescendingly as they read the story
of the scores of people who were unintentionally
duped by a bank which placed in its window par-
ticulars concerning the now-famous “cat ranch”
promotion scheme.

The scheme, as most persons will remember,
involved two ranches—a cat ranch and a rat
ranch. Starting out with a few dozen cats and a
few scores of rats, the promoters asserted they
could soon be producing an unlimited quantity
of cat fur. According to their plan, the cats would
eat the rats and the rats would eat the skinned
cats—leaving the furs as “unearned incremen,
so to speak

Much to the amazement of the bank officials,
one reader of the placard after another scurried
enthusiastically into the bank to seek further par-
ticulars—in spite of the fact that the scheme was
plainly labeled as a fake.

One cannot but wonder if the originators of
some of the fantastic old age pension plans which
have recently been suggested are not the work
of that selfrsame “cat-and-rat" magnate. Certain-
ly the proposal of Dr. F. E. Townsend lays that
particular gentleman open to suspicion.

This proposal provides for the federal govern-
ment to pay pensions of $200 a month to citizens
past the age of 60, who are not habitual crim-
inals, upon promise to retire from work and to
spend the allotted money within the month they
receive it. Applicants for these pensions would
merely have to take an oath that they would
spend the money in the United States on the same
month.

At $2,400 per year, this would cost approxi—
mately $20,000,000,000 per annum, equivalent to
more than one-half of the present national in-
come. This sum, seven times the amount of the
entire normal budget of the national government
and only a few billion less than the total national
debt, all figures being quoted from an article
in The New York Times, would be paid ovér to
6 per cent of the country’s population.

The gullibility of Mr, American Citizen is
again made patent by the surprisingly wide»
spread support of this plan, far-fetched though it
is.

There is a very genuine need for a feasible
old— age pension plan and one will no doubt ulti-
mately be devised, but false panaceas—cat and~rat
schemes on a national scale—are not the answer
to the countrys problem.

STUDENTS ARE ADULTS
(Indiana Daily Student)

“If the time ever comes when we are prepared to
treat university students like adults. we shall see fur-
ther economies in administration," Robert Maynard
Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, declared
in a recent article in the Yale Review. “Universih‘es,”
he said, “have developed the idea in parean, or parents
have developed it in universities. that the institution is
in some way responsible {or the moral, social, and intel-
lectual welfare of the student. This is Very nice for the
parents; it is hard on the universities, for, besides being
expensive, it deflects from their main task, which is the
advancement of‘ knowledge.

A university cannot undertake to give a student
character or intellectual interest, he said. If it is to
to do its work properly. the student must have these qua].
ities when he enrolls, President Hutchins is not speak‘
ing only of the University of Chicago where he has
made great strides forward in administration and con.
tributed in no mean degree to the advancement of knowl-
edge. He is speaking of any university which ﬁnds that
it is spending too much money to do the work of a cus—
todian establishment, a church, or of a body-building in»
stitutc.

Parents who do not make adults of their children
before they ship them off to college unquestionably are
handicapping not only the school which receives the
chﬂdmn but also ilic children themselves. If a boy or
girl can not take care of biniseli or hcrsclt by the time
college age is reached, it is unlikely that ho or she will
learn to do so without unnecessary trouble and expense
for the school which receives him or her. The work of
the university should begin where the work of the par.
cnts leaves off, The duties of the two should not over.

The Book Nook

By TKDKLEIN

As new books are added to the
library those which are thought to
be of general interest to students and

these are times when we must look
askance at the destructive criticism of
a man who will not venture to pro-
pose a way out other than turning
back to the artificial and thoroughly

undesirable economy prevailing in

the Mad Twenties.

lative and economic, of the past year
is concise and clear and if for no
other reason the book is valuable asa
handbook or reference of a Spectacular
period in history. The author is a
skillful, honest commentator who suc.
cecds in combining accurate exposi-

tion with clear-cut opinion.

The summary of the events, legise
faculty alike are placed on the table

immediately to the south of the count.
or on the first ﬂoor of the college lie
brat-y. These books cover a wide
variety of subjects which should touch
the individual interests of the stu—
dent at some point, The following
review is of a book to be found on'the
new—book shelf for the coming week.

“The Menace of Recovery" by Will—
iam MacDonald.

The title of this book naturally suga
gesc the query—Recovery, a menace
to what’.’ Mr. MacDonald is correct
in thinking that it is a menace to the
simple system of natural liberty so
dear to the hem of laisseLfairc
economists. But if, as he irnplies,'the
recovery program is a menace to
economic welfare he does not seem to
succeed in proving his presumption.

The book is written in a manner'
which seems to indicate that, some-
how, the author has managed to keep
himself completely detached from. the
changes which have rocked this old
world since 1929. His objective of the
"enthronement of runion labor” and
the endeavor of the government to re
strict cutrthroat overproduction for
which here is no market clearly stamn
him as a thinker of the economic
school which enjoyed popular favor
until that fateful October day a halt-
decade ago. It is a good thing to
have a countenstatement of the phi—
losophy underlying the New Deal but
