Editorial/Opinion

Congratulations WhllC trustees moot,
Ali

in an era when sttttlent opinion is
almost always ignored on this ran-pas,
it is encouraging to see that once in a
while students can ruulte some progress
in improving their own college. An ex-
ample of jml touch a student nitiated
improvement! is the faculty's decision
last week in add pluses to letter grader,
thereby creating a . fair system of
grading. Yet, the fairness of the new
grading system is not as tignijieont or
the fact that the faculty actually took
action upon a recommendation of the
sludonr body.

Mach of the credit for getting the
grading system changed belongs to Slu-
tlcnt Government Association president
Ali ElSa/fttr, who was highly successful
in convincing this college‘s conscr-
valive focalty that pluses in a grading
system benefit both students and facul-
ly.

Better than any SGA president itt re.
cent memory. ElSaf/ar has vttcceedetl
in clearly articulating the needs of the
student body to all atlministraliau
which often overlooks the net-dc of
sllldettls. Witt. patience and teen-en.
dons perseverance, Elsttffar and 56A
senator Mark Hallerberg have scored a
major bictary for the entire student
body. Beginning next fall, Grinnell CoL
lege n~ill hoce o more just and fair
grading system thanks to ElSoffar and
an uncommonly attentive farttlty. Con-
gralulnliotu Ali, now how oltoat ltaffer
days?

Tiltv tuition at the college is going to
be raised by a! fetal 800 dollars this
weekend. The tuition raise will be the
nineteenth raise in tho last nineteen
years at orinnell College. The college

student slams
divestment policy

by Carol Pilgrim

In May, 1935, the Board of Trustees pass-
ed its Divestiture Resolution. The Resolu-
tion states, “The Trustees of Grinnell Col-
lege have found and continue to find the
apartheid policies of the government of the
Republic of South Attica to be morally
repugnant and unforgivable." This last
year has caused some question as to
whether or not the trustees remain, or
were ever, Committed to divestment.

The trustees claim to find the govern-
ment of South Attica morally repugnant.
However, their actions have stemmed
from economic and political concerns
rather than moral ones. Last summer,
when the trustees reaffirmed the Resolur
tion, they did so for pragmatic reasons, not
moral ones. The trustees were concerned
about the bad publicity Grinnell would
receive if it moved away from divestment
while the rest of the nation was moving
towards it. They were afraid that the 001*
lege would damage its reputation as an
avantrgarde, progressive institution.

The distinction between moral and
political concern may seem to be a line
one, but in reality the emphasis on politics
renects a concern for Grinnell’s image

The trustees approved

divestment for fear of
losing the college‘s ‘

avant—garde,
progressive

reputation.

rather than ior the welfare of blacks in
South Africa. The Divestment Resolution
is more Symbolic than effective.

Out of Grinnell‘s SZZO-million endow-
ment me college has divested only $65,344).
Almost $7 million remains invested in
companies with ties in South Africa. Last
spring, the students recommended the
divestment of $3,957,154-W0rth of stock.
The trustees approved the divestment ol
only $54500. In comparison, Oberlin Col-
lege has divested $750,000; Carleton Cola
lege, $1,477,200; and Amherst College,

$34,000,000

Proof of the trustees' political and
economic bias is contained in the clause in
the resolution Stating, “This policy shall be
implemented by the Board in a manner so
as not to have an undue adverse effect on
the College’s security portfolio.” Moral
concerns remain absolute regardless" of
economic consequences. The qualification
of “an undue adverse effect” may seem
reasonable, but the trustees claim to have
passed the resolution because apartheid
policies are “unforgivable.” It appears the
trustees would forgive the South African
government if the cost of divestment
became too high. Moral claims cannot be
qualified and remain moral claims. They
become political claims. ‘

This year, the trustees’ May meeting
will be especially crucial. In May, loss,
Rev. Sullivan declared that if apartheid is
not dismantled by May, 1987, he would call
for a total economic embargo against
South Africa. This means the criterion of
the resolution, failure of compliance with
the Sullivan Accords (the standards for
employment practice in South Africa), will
become obsolete. To prove their commit»
ment, the trustees will need to take a
stronger stand against apartheid than par-
tial divestment.

The second criterion of the resolution is
strategic or technological involvrnent.
This criterion has always been pro
blematic, Not only is a direct link to the
South African government exceedingly
dillicult to prove, but the company must be
shown to have a detrimental effect on
human rights conditions in South Africa,
Although this criterion sounds fair, it is by
nature subjective, and it is continually usr
ed to block divestment.

The trustees have based their divest-
ment policy on the publicity that policy
receives. This fact can be used against
them, Grinnell College’s divestment
resolution must become more than a Cam-
pus issue. It must become a national and a
moral issue. The fact that the trustees are
not morally committed to divestment only
makes it more important that the students
are.

View from the Outside

by Paul Draus ,

I'm starting to regret missing this whole
poverty symposium thing,

I don’t recall what I was doing that caus—
ed me to be absent from the historical
event. I imagine I was out tooling about in
my BMW somewhere, or making in-
vestments, or buying expensive foreign
beers. I can’t remember. Us rich white
boys lead such complicated lives, it’s
hard to keep track oi things from one day
to the next.

Anyway, the point is, I did miss it. I
missed it, and I didn't get to see Mitch
Snyder telling the Grinnell student body
the truth about poverty in America.

in fact, the whole idea that poverty ex-
isted in America came as a shock to me. I
mean, I knew there were poor people in
Africa somewhere, or something, but I
didn’t realize we had some of them here in
me good old 0.5. of A. When I heard about
it, though, naturally I was concerned, and
I wanted to do all I could to help.

That’s another reason I'm sorry I miss-
ed Mitch. Apparently he suggested a way
we could all help those less fortunate than
ourselves. We could do like Mitch has

sone, and quit school, and drop out oi con-
ventional society, and go to live with and
help the impoverished, and work towards
building a just society.

What a great idea! We could all just up
and leave. and go to live with our poor
desperate homeless brothers and sisters,
wherever they may be.

id have a hard time explaining it to my
father, but I'm sure he’d understand, once
I told him‘ about the poor people. Maybe
he’d even want to go with me. After all,
Mitch waited until he had a wife and
several children before he decided that he
should help out, so 1 don't see any reason
why it would be too late for Dad to give up
his job and go stake out a cat at the old
homeless shelter. Of course, my mother
would have trouble putting my little sister
through school on her meager nurse’s
salary, But what the hell! I'm sure Mom,
being the good Catholic she is, would want
to go along as well, as soon as she heard
about all those less fortunate than
ourselves, and she could bring my little
slster with her. of course, after Dad left,
and Mom was stuck with all the bills, she
would probably be one of those less for-

tunate than ourselves, so she would have
little choice in the matter anyway.

But why stop there? why not have
everyone drop out of society and go live
with the poor people? In tact, we could
just give away our houses, since we won’t
be needing them anymore anyway, and
homeless people could go live in them, and
then they wouldn't be homeless anymore.
And if my father quits his job, someone
will have to take over, so why not give his
job to someone who really needs it? It all
makes perfect sense to me now. We here at
Grinnell, and college students across the
country, could all drop out of school, and
we could let the poor kids get educated.
After all, the tuitions were going to be
paid anyway, we might as well give all
that schooling to someone who could really
use it. And then all the people who are poor
and hungry now would be rich and wellr
fed, and they’d be happy. And all of us who
are rich and well-fed now would be poor
and hungry, but nonetheless happy,
because we would have just helped all our
brothers who really needed helping.

It's all so simple 1 wonderwhy no one
ever thought of It before?

 

Ali says...

by Ali ElSaffar

I think I have taken the idea of represenr
ting the students too tar. Yes, 1 live on
campus. Yes, I eat dining services food.
Yes, I even take classes! And last week. I
got everybody else’s cold. The result is I
just didn’t have the time to write a column
last week, and don’t have the time to write
a long essay, like my previous columns,
this week. Instead, please accept these
snippets of news from the life of Grinneli's
student bureaucracy, the Student Govern;
ment Association,

Thanks to faculty and student
cooperation, we finally have a sensible
grading system in place at Grinnell, one
that incorporates both pluses and minuses.
The new System will go into effect next
semester, For those Students who have
received grada under the old system, not
your grade point average will not be
Changed. Your future GPA will be com-
puted using whatever grade point was
assigned to you with your original grade,
regardless of the system, The change in
systems will be noted on the transcript.

Things can move pretty slowly at
Grinnell, even in SGA. That’s why I get
such seemingly irrational joy when I can
quickly rmlve some oi the little problems
t’lat affect students. The most recent bit oi
odd joy has centered around what I call
The Hook Issue. A few weeks ago, someone
decided to take the Hooks from the coat
area in Cowles. for reasons unknown. and
left the floor as the only option tor resting
student jackets, I brought the issue betore
the Big Three in the Student Affairs Office,
and within a matter of days, new hooks
were installed. The new Books are of a
lesser quality, to make stealing them less
attractive. Nonetheless, North Campus
diners can now hang their coats in dignity
again, Oh, for the little things.

4) A really slow moving issue has been
the lack of lights in some areas of North
Campus. Yes, i know it is very dark
around the Younker Memorial Health
Center and Darby Parking Lot, and SGA
asked last semester and will continue to
ask. that the college install lighting in
those areas, And they will get around to it
soon. I hope. At least the Hooks are in.

5) It‘s February, the Trustees are com-
