students.

2.7A second thing which character-
izes the college lite and ot which the
students are proud, is the quality at
the work that the college is doing,
and has done in the years gone by.
This need not he treated at any
length. Grinnell has liuilt up a repu-
tatioll i'or high-class worlr,and stands
today preeminent among institutions
at class lor scholarship. The
prcscnt generation students is
proud or this tact, spite ot
the murmurings and complaints which
sometimes arise, hseanse ot the iii-
sisteuee that is put upon consistent
class room work, decp doivii iii the
hearts ot tllc stiidellts there is joy that
their lot is cast wlicre such require
ments are made and wtiere the wort:

(lllonL thiiig to hear students give ei
prossion to this thought. The class
room lvorit nieanssonieth g to the
students and is an inspiration to wider
and more thorough study. A course

person cares for, and he is encouraged
in this to the utmost, iiiithctstmlght
that iiaiiiw a good time is not the

approval or student opinion.

3.——A third point to he considered
is the appreciation the students have
or the tact that the object or the col-
lege is to train men and women, and
not simply to turn out scholars. The
product or town College is ilot to lie
unassitled men and woolen. As has
stated, scholarship and
thorough work are characteristics or
the college and essential to her pros
perily, liut scliolaiship alone is not
siillicient, The well halanccd student,
with his mental, physical and spirit
iial powers equally well trained, is the
kind that is sought. character is
held to be supremely above mere menr
tnl alertness or intellectual attain-
ment, and the college would tall tar
short ot realising the high purpose
tor which it was tollnded, i it railed
to take cognizance at this tact, The
line sense or honor, the high moral
tone, and the upright character oi
the graduates that have gone out
tronl Grillilell are quite as mucll re»
sponsihle tor the college's enviable
reputation throughout the state, as
is the schola V work that has been
done. This lact is recognized by the
present hodr of students and there is
every reason to believe that the repu~
tation or the college will he sate in
their keeping.

4.7A l‘ourth point which should he
noted is the spirit which animates tlic
cciiege lite. Much has been said and
u itteo ahout the “urinoell spirit,"
and many traditions have been handed
down showing its potency in times ot
great emergency. Much can he said
concerning its existence at the present
time, tor it is a living reality, and
exercises a tremendous inlluence up-
on the present student lilc. A studs
ent from the Universi or town, re-
eeiltly remarked, ivllilc Visiting in
Grinnell, that be had heard so much
about the Grinnell spirit that to him
it seemed like a living being, and

in the class room, in the societies,
in the social lite and in daily inter»
course. the true G iniiell spirit means
the cieniplincation or loyalty to the
highest ideals and an unselnsh oevo
tioii to the best interests or the whole
college. Furthermore, IL is not some-
thing that can be iett behind when
students are graduated, but it goes
with them into their own work and
remains with them, as an inspiring
and regulating torce. it means much
to the graduate; it means much to the
student, and it means much to the
college.

in conclusion, let it he said that the
claim is not made that the lite in
lown college is all that it should he;
that there are no inconsistencies;
that periection has heen reached. Far
iroru it. But no hesitancy is telt in
declaring the conviction that the life

soiiic in eiel'y wa , one that encour-
ages the growth 01 loity ideals and de-
votion to the we ~ 0t realizing them;
one that tends to produce moral as
well as physical and mental strength.
This tact is recognized by the stud-
ents and exercises a great iurluence
upon the tlnily life or the institution.
