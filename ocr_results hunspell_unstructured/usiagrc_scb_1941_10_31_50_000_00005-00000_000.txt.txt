Interesting as the Debussy “So-
nata in G Minor” was, it seemed
less well suited to Spaldlng’s par-
ticular talents. “La campanella"
(Pagillinl»Spalding) furnished the
most technically breathtaking
moments of the entire evening,
and its strategic position at the
close of the program was final
proof of the fact that Spalding is
an expert showman.

The most impressive qualities of
Spalding's fiddlingithe Anglm
Saxon term is eminently fitting
here—are smoothness and straight.
forwardness. These traits were
displayed most significantly in the
Beethoven sonata, but were just
as evident in such a trite encore
as Schubert's "Ave Maria,"

Spalding can reasonably be
called—if there is any reason to
‘such lemsithe greatest living
native American violinist. His tal<
ent, like his reputation, is an en-
viable one, and although some-
what lacking in the emotional and
intellectual fire of a Heifetz, he
can always be counted on to give
a sterling performance.

Wednesday’s audience expected
a great deal, and it got what it
expected. It was obviously delight-
ed and therefore generous in its
applause, and Spalding was in
turn generous with his eneores,
which included Debussy’s "En Ba—
teau," Schubert's "Ave Maria," a
Brahms' “Wslm,” Dinlcu’s “Hora.
staccato” in the Heifetz arrange-
ment, Granados’ “Spanish Dance,"
and Chaminade’s "Spanish Sere-
nade."

The appearance of Spalding in
Grinnell sets a high standard by
which to measure the other at—
tractions o: the current season;
by all tokens they promise just
such distinguished entertainment

as the Spalding recital achievedi
