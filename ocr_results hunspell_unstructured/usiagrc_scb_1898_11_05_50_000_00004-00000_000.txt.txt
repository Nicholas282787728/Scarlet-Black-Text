it should he very soon. Some or
the 'Varsity men have been unable

Harvard-Penn. Game.

The I'Iarvald-Pcnllsylvanla con-
test to day will clearly be one of
principles. Pennsylvania bellcves
in the close formalioll and line
smashes with guards back, while
Harvard uses the more open style
of play, lntrusting to the backs
most of the carrying the ball. A
comparison of the teams shows
them to be about equal in height
and weight with age and individ-
ual strength slightly in I’cnll.'s
favor. In punting Harvard hasa
decided advantage. That both
teams will score is not doubled.
As this is the ﬁrst Cllalllpiollshlp
game in the east, much interest is
attracted by it.
