This year Grinnell college can chalk up another first. l
A new course, the first of its kind, has been introduced‘
into the curriculum.

difficult and challenging ideas.

Every Monday a faculty member lectures on a partic-

readings, provides students with material so they are able

through speeches and themes.

Because this course demands discussion outside of
class, the result has been an increasing interest in the
basic problems of our timeiour “intellectual and spiritual
predicament” ill the mid—twentieth century. On both sides
of the campus, interest has extended far beyond the jul-l-
iors who happen to be taking the course. Furthermore, the
professors are stimulated as well as the students.

As president of the Young'
Republicans’ club at Grinnell I
suppose I’ll be in line for some
important government post. My
work for the Grand Old Party
began back in 1932 when I was
four years old and had a little
cap with different kinds of
buttons all over it, Most of
the buttons bore pictures of
various breeds of dogs and
flags of foreign countries How-
ever. all the rcst,were Hoover
buttons.

The Grinnell college radio workshop had a chance tO‘

provide real service to the students Tuesday night. With
its teletype machine reportingon national, state, and local

elections, the station could have stayed on all night giving

students these results.

the issue.

On election day in 1932 l
stationed myself at the near-
est polling place and urged vo-
ters to Cast their ballots for
Hoover. ,A policeman kept
chasing me away but I wasn’t
very easily scared by the law
or its enforcement officers in
those days. I wasn’t aware of
it but some of the party whips
must have had their eyes on me
then for I’ve felt that they’ve
lbceii grooming me far bigger
lthings ever since. There have
,been moments since 1932 when
l began to wonder if I'd ever
get a chance to serve the party
in power without changing
allegiance.

I have been patient and now
I know that I can expect my
lduc. I haven’t made up my
mind whether to put in my
bid for a cabinet position, a
lseat on the high court, or a
diplomatic post. A few years
as ambassador to France might
lprove very educational and I
lean certainly stand a good deal
in: practice and improvement
in the romance languages, On
the other hand, as secretary of
defense I’d be in position to
keep in touch with the military
careers of my classmates and
hallebrothers. The more I
think about it the more I hope
that Ikeebabe doesn’t use ‘me
to pack the court. I've always
found majority rule very frusr
trating and pointless.

 

They say that Mr. Stevenson
lis out of Work now and I heard
lone campus Democrat express
‘the hope that Eisenhower has
the good sense to use Adlai in
his administration. I can as-
sure that fellow that one of the
first things I shall do upon my
arrival in the nation’s capital
Will be to recommend Steven-
lson for some position. I hear
that there is an opening in the
senate Cafeteria for a busboy
and I think that a man of
‘Stevenson’s intellect and char
'acter should have little trouble
‘,passing the necessary civil ser»'

l vice examinations.

l

To the Young Democrats of
;the student body, the Middle-
aged Progressives of the facul-
ty,,and the Old Prohibitionists
lof the administration and Board
of Trustees, I wish to express
my respect and admiration for
the sportsmanlike way in which
,they have accepted the decie
‘sion of the electorate. I’ll ale
‘ways remember Grinnell as the
place where my political am-
bitions round their first ex-
pressiun and fruition. if i can
perform any service such as
arranging an RFC icon for the
Honor G, finnking privilcges
for the Dean of Men to send
letters to parents, or surplus
broccoli for the foods departs
ment, 1 shall not turn my back
on Alma Mater,
