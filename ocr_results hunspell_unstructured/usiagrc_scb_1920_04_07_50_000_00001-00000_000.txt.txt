PSYCH TESTS ARE

Correlation S h o w 11 Between
Grades And Brains. r

.A psychological test of the mental
ability of a total of 258 Freshmen
shows a wide variation in results. Out
of a possible 153 points, one person
obtained 160 and another 161. The
lowest test registered to points. The
correlation between the greatest men
tal power and the highest grades was
shown to be quite high but still higher
between the least mental capacity and
the lowest grades.

Very interesting tacts have been
reached by a comparison of the grades
of those having entrance language
units and those credited with none. or

MALTEASER MAKES
FIRST APPEARANCE

Art Work is Feature of First Is-
slle s Local Material Out
To Minimum.

The hialteascr. Grinuell‘s new bus
morons magazme. published by- the
local chapter of sigma Delta Chi, made
its mltjal appearance on . Monday.
March 29. amid the general approval
of the student body. Cummins Raw-
son is editor of the new publication,
Vincent Yager business manager. Les-
lic Miles art director.

lnueh favorable comment was done
by a staff Consisting of Miles. Robert
Blldlong. John Kenlmcrcr and Frank
Darne

Opinions differ regarding the best
features of the magazine. altllo "signs
of Spring” by Eglofl’ and Miles has
met with a g1 eat deal of approval. The
page of “Boneheads” was also a. source
of lunch amusement.

As 15 the custom with college hue
morons magazines the local material
has 11ch cut to 1 minimum altho one.
page “Local L) cs" has devoted ell
ltil‘ely to appl'opllatc velsc cancer-n
Iing members of the faculty and Stll

.. dent body.
The material of the magazine with.
‘the exception or one page or clippings

is original. The most obvious criticism
of the magazine is the presence or a
number of poemsand jokes which lac .
punch and seem to have no real po1ut.
altho in a n1. gazinc devoted purely to
humorous material it is probably 11n-

.nossible to ellnllnate all such materia .
The appearance and general makeup .

of the magazine is especially pleasing.
The cover is an attractive and humor-
ons picture of a cat printed in grey
ongrecn. The printing is well done
and the use of light race type through-
out the magazine is good. '1

A member of Sigma Delta Chi in
speaking or the magazine this morn-
"We have gotten many Daint—
ors about the publication of humorous

sazines through the worlr on 11
ﬁrst issue and hope to proﬁt by the
experience thus gained by putting out
a superior magazine in the future.”

The general comment on The Mall-
teaser has been favorable and it is

forward with anticipation to the ape
pearanee of the second issue

HAMIINE DEBATE IS _
ND DEDISIDN AFFAIR

Is Last Debate of Season — Four
Men End Collegiate Debate
Careers

Grinnell‘s debating season closed
Saturday night, March 27, with a no»
decision debate .with.Hamlinc Univer-
sity at St. l’aul‘. The same team do-
bated MacAlestcr. Friday night.

The team that went to St. Paul was
composed of Bruce Ashby. Angus Mc-
Donald, and Earl Moscr. The ﬁrst de-
bate at st. Paul. with MacAlester,
March 25. resulted in a unanimous vic-
tory for the MacAlester negative team
on the proposition: “Resolved: That
Congress Should Enact Legislation
Providing for Compulsory Arbitration
In All Labor Disputes of Public Sel'v»
ice Corporations." The follom‘ng
night. March 27, witnessed a no»decis-
ion with Hemline. This was a new ex-
perience for both schools but was
tried because or the growing popu-
larity of this type of debate. and be-

cause of the fact that Grinnell had a!

debate with another teadn on the Same
subject on the precedlng night. The

“results of (he nil-decision debate were

very satisiactory and it is possible that
this form of contest will receive more
attention in the future.

Four of the men who debated tor
Crinnell this year have seen their last
intercollegiate Iorcnsic contest. They
are Ronald noehmler. Mason Ladd.
Earl Maser. and Linn Smith. All of
these men have been active in society
work and have appeared in inter—soci-
ety debates. The remainder of this
yo. s debaters are all oualidcd for
another year or more in college foren-
sics.
