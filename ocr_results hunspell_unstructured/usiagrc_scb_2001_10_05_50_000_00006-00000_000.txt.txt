J: Actually, I expected there to be a lot less decorum in the class.
room trom my experience on the east and west coasts. students at
other colleges, in my experience, are a lot more casual, like the
way they dress, the way they sit in the classroom. Now that is not
to say Grihnell students are uptight, either. i like informality but
sometimes it could be carried a little too far. while I like to be
friendly 1 also like to keep a certain balance between the roles of
the teacher and the student. while 1 found students at other
colleges sometimes a bit too casual and informal, I found a nice
balante among the students here.

5&9: rknow that the class you taught was aboutethnitrty, religion,
and politics in South Asia.

J1Yes, from what rve heard students here haven't had much expo~
sure to South Asia. I had 20 Students taking the class, and many
more wanted to add but couldn't due to deadlines and what not, I
was happy to see the degree oiinterestirom students in the sube
ject.

came, After I leave Grinnell, I'll give a lecture at Holy Cross Cole
lege in Worcester, Mass. Then I'm heading north to Bowdoin Col-
lege and Bates College in Maine. Then I’ll spend some time in
Europe betore I go batk to Sn lanka.

said: Sound: like you are a long way away from home yet.
J: indeed, I have many more miles to go before I can sleep.
5&3: What will you remember most from onnnell?

J: Unfortunately, the event of Sept. 11 will always remain in my
mind, betause when those events happened I was at Grlnriell and
it was also the first day or my class. But on the other hand, I will
always rememberthe warmth and friendliness I received at Gririrlell
and the academic rigor 1 saiv here.

sash: Finally, do you have any ndvrce you would give students at
Grimiell?

J: I’d advise them to keep an open mind and learn to question
things in a responsible way. Don't take anything for granted. Ee
always alert and try to spread a greater understanding in this world.
One or the greatest tragedies today is the mistrust and the lack of

understanding, especially between people irom dirierent cultural
backgrounds. There's one bond that unites us all~we are all hu-
man. Even/thing we do should be to promote decency and tairness
between and among human beings. Do not to discn'mrnate or hate
because someone is from a different country or is of different skin
color.

There's a favorite line of mine from the British post W. H. Auden.
He said in one of his puems something in the line like 'We mlist all
love each other or die.’ As we live in an increasingly interdepene
dent world, we must all try to help each other. it might sound too
idealistic, but I think teachers are idealists. Arid I am a teacher;
the bestin me comes out as a teacher, Iﬁrmly believe that is the
way to goodness and a peaceful world tor all of us.

said: 1 think this means so much more coming from you, given the
path you took and came from and the things you've experienced and
seen.

J: The more I travel the more I recognize the oneness of humans.
I hope things that happened to my country and the recent trags
edies will never happen again in any other places.
