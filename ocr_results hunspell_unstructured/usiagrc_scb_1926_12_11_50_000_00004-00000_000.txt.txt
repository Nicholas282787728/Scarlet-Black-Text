To those at you who have been
hind enough to road this lztr, I want
to commend “The Word or a Whitict
or," by et Weishnar. In writ»
ing or Martha's love “Opportunity
Lost." the author develops a style
replete with objecti ity of phrase.
Bits or diction that brighten the love
stoi are her description or the
"shin spoked phtletou,” the door that
"Lil'zlllged open" and of the lady or
“cold storage inind, packed with long-
preserved notions."

Displaying a touch or editorial sen~
sationalism, Herold Hicks commends
lirookhart in the piece, "The Duce or
iowa Politics." ilr. Hiclis' style is=
thoroughly readable, but his conclllse

Lindsay enables John Kczlrns, liter-
ary editor or the Jacksonville (Illin—

is exhibited in Mr. Kearlls’ article
than in any ot the Tanager contribu-
tions.
