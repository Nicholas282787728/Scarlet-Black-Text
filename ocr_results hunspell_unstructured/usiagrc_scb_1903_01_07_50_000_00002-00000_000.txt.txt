élN the death of Hon. R. M.
Haines. Iowa College has
lost a ﬁrm friend and constant
supporter. Since his graduation
in 1865 Mr. Haines has ahvays
taken an active interest in the colr
lege life and ior years past has
been one of our faithltll and hard-
working irusiees. Toward the
college lte has shown the same
devotion and iaillliul care that he
gave ltis tarnily and clients, And
the college extends to the family
its heartrest sympathy, feeling
that where they have lost a
husband and father, it has lost a
h’lle iriend.

T the banquet and re union of
Iowa College alurnni and
friends lteld at Des Moines during
the Christmas recess, the proposi-
tion tor a new chapel nas received
with enilitlsiasm. The alumni
realize our need and the same
generosity that has been shown
at other times will doubtless soon
make the chapel an assured tact.
Every alumnus IS glad logive what
he can and it it is only necessary
to show the pressing need .‘or the
new building to insure help for its
erection. And one only has to
come and observe for himself and
see our cramped and unsalls
factory quarters, to be convinced
ot the need of a new building,
