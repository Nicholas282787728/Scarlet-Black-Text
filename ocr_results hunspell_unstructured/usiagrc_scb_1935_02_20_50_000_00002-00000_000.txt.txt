PASSING OUT BOUQUETS.

To both the Grinnell chapter of National Col-
legiate Players and to the class of 1937, bouquets
for very commendable service.

Although feeling that they could not sponsor
the Steiner Memorial prize in playwriting since
only members of their group will be entered in
the contest'—whieh is justifiable enough—the
group did agree to finance the prize in graphic
arts this spring. As a result, the Steiner contests
which have proved most popular in the past will
all be held this spring and the student leaders in
the field of art, as well as in dramatics and
English composition, can be given the recognition
which they deserve.

To the sophomore class, a sprig of laurel for
establishing what—the fates willing—may de-
velop into a tradition which will eliminate in the
future the needless and boring process of electing
underclass officers.‘ If, by taking initiative in the
matter and {refusing to elect a set of figurcheads,
the class of '37 has established a precedent which
classes in years to come will see fit to observe,
their contribution to the campus will be a real one.

DE. HOLMES SCORES.

It is often argued as a condemnation of the
lecture system of education that men go forth
from the lecture hall failing to retain much of
the material presented to them. And yet, in
spite of the passing of time and the coming of
many new interests, echoes of Dr. John Holmes’
recent Gates lectures are still resounding on the
campus.

It is evident, then, that he created a great
stir in the intellect of the average Grinnell stu.
dent. Indeed, it might be said that his coming
created somewhat of an intellectual awakening
on the Grinnell campus, lifting our minds, for
a time at least, above the trivialties of humdrum

college life to the consideration of deep and ur—
gent questions of social and religious signific-
ance.

Regardless of what one thinks of the truth oi
Dr. Holmes’ ideas and Concepts, the basic value
of his virile and powerful message lay in the men-
tal stimulation that it caused. His stay here
in Grinncll was marked by one of those infro~
quent times when college life temporarily drops
its usual indifference, and jerks itself from a
:ustomary state of apathy to do some conscientious,
logical thinking. Undergraduates in their spare
moments debated the likelihood lol the downfall
of capitalism. Professors pondered upon the
true significance of his statements and attempted
to separate the wheat from the chaff for the bone—
fit of questioning students. Even the intermittent
“bull sessions" were lifcd from their usual low
level of gossip and idle talk to temporarily take
on the appearance of open forums in which the
merits of socialism and capitalism were discussed.

Congratulations are indeed due Dr. Holmes,
for in this age of sophistication and apparent un-
concern over the great problems of humanity
the men who can achieve the miracle that D
Holmes did on this campus are few and far be.
tween. May it Come about that more men of his
calibre may visit Grinnell college in the future,
bringing with them messages to stimulate the stu»
dEnt body to occasional periods of genuine, earnest
deliberation on problems of importance.

G
A PEACE—TIME CARRIER

The Macon disaster has supplied the oppon—
ents of lighter-than-air craft with fresh ammuni—
tion to be used “as proof of the airship‘s insecur-
ity.” They have made the sweeping demand
that experimentation with dirigibles be complete-
ly abandoned, pointing to the fact that most of
the major powers of the world have ceased to
build airshlps. President Roosevelt has said that
at the present time he would not recommend
that any more funds be spent on dirigibles.

The case for the military and naval airship
is at best very weak. Germany‘s experience
during the war with this type was far from satis—
factory. Nor has experience since the war been
any more successful in military construction,
as strength and durability must be sacrificed in
order to make the ships continually lighter so
that they may rise high and escape gunfire.
This fact accounts for the apparent inability of
di igibles to meet unfavorable weather (3011le
tions. It is exclusively in this field of military
and naval construction that this country has been
experimenting.

An important factor stands out however in
another phase of man’s experience with airships,
Not one rigid dirigible has ever been destroyed
in the commercial service Builders of this type
have not been limited by the restrictions which
have hampered the builders of Zeppelins for mili—
tary service. Safety and durability have been
the mopt important factors in this field, and ships
have ”been built which can withstand severe
weather conditions. From 1910 to 1914 a Ger
man concern operated a fleet of six ships that
flew 172,000 miles and carried 33 thousand pass
angers without loss of a life.

What can be alone in the commercial serr
vice is exempliefied by the German ship Graf
Zeppelin. This ship has, since 1928, traveled
over half a million miles, carried over 10 thou—
sand passengers and has crossed the ocean 60
times. It still makes regular trips between
Germany and Brazil.

The critics were too hasty when they con.
demned all airships to the scrap heap as being
unsafe, Without a doubt they have proved
their incompetence for military service. But
certainly the Graf Zeppelin is a convincing argu~
ment that at least in commerce there is a place
for the dirigible in which the structural factors of
safety has been amply provided.

We live in such a busy and complex
world that most of us find difficulty
in keeping in touch with the many

each and every one of these vital
questions of the day, but lacking that
opportunity we can at least super.
ficially keep infonncd through a wide

the periodicals. The following short

‘Mutualism’ Topic
of Vespers Talk
by Prof. Canard

Most of the social relationships with
which we are familiar did not grow
fortuitously but were inevitable, assert.
cd Prof, Henry S. Canard, head of the
botany department, in his address at
Vespers Sunday. He pointed out that,
although these relationships are ordin.
arily spoken of in terms of either com-
petition or cooperation, often compo.
titlve and cooperative relations exist
between two factors at the Same

To support this contention, Dr. Con.

illustrating how both plant and an.
imal life developed through the exist.
once of such relationships, Dr. Con.
ard declared, “One hundred million
years ago there were only woody
plants on the earth; no colored or
scented flowers—just the green and
brown of the evergreens." This was
the period in which reptiles dominated
the animal life of the world.

Attractive flowers came into exist.

and butterflies, he continued, citing
this as an example of natural cooper.

such grazing animals as the deer,
moose and bison, began to appear sim.
ultaneously with the wide prairies of
cross. He offered a number of other
examples of such natural mutualism.

In concluding. Dr. Canard express.
ed the belief that such wide evidence
of the existence of natural mutualism
this relationship almost approaches the
scope of a cosmic law. This tendency
of natural forces to aid one another
even though they apparently combat
each other, is, be declared, illustrative
of the law of life.
