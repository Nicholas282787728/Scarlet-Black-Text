The [l‘eshlnan»sophonlol'e dual meet

and the fact that it was the ﬁrst meet

The annual home meet will he held
[next Saturday. The class of 1915, who
have won the meet every year since
they have been in school, are not slate
ed for the honor this year due to the
heavy loss of men thrri enlistments.
The juniors are in almost as bad shape,
and it is possible that the winner 01

carry off the honors next week.

Following the two local meets come

Amusement Tnl' Nondlaucrrs

The only amusement provided for
non-dancers at the all-college dances
is in the form at games, a special room
being decorated and turned ovcr to one
of the young women who has had some
cherlence in entertaining. The games
vary widely in nature, and seem to be
dctcrnnned largely by the n rim of the
moment of those who happen to bc
present; but it is interesting to note
that collcgc students scorn to be enter-
tained by many games which at first
glance appear decidedly childish. The
success of Such aluus ments seems to
depend almost entirely on the ability
and personality of the leader.

The only other dances including the
college in general are the lntel'Jmtere
nrty dances, given Jointly by the ﬁve
national fraternities at irregular Ins
tervals, gencrally once a semester.

All-College Picnic

The allrcollege picuio completes the
list of general social affair it is held
on Washington's birthday each year,
iii the Garden of the Gods, and is une
der the direction of the Student Come
mission. It is a picnic pure and sim-
ple, with the amusements one would
expect at a picnic; tag hunts, faculty
strrnts, baseball games, biking, and a
icnic dinner served cafeteria style.
All the fraternities give dances, and
an organization including represenlae
tires from each fraternity has recently
,hecn permitted to dance also. The
llonrﬁ'aternity men also are permitted
to give dances, tho they rarely do so.

Each organization has a night as-
signed to it for its function at the reg-
ular meeting of the social schedule
committee at the" beginning of each se~
mester; and the number of functions
allowed is gcnerally about one per
month. Smaller dances, say of six to
ten couples, are arranged for with the
permission of the dean of women at
almost any time, and are rather popu-
lar within the fraternity houses.

inking Is Populur

Card-playing has no recognized
standing whatever, and is never made
a means of entertainment at fraternity
or all-college parties, Hiking is of
course very popular, on account of the
number-less attractive spots in the
mountains only a short distance from
the campus. in addition to the things
already named, the girls' societies
have dances occasionally. but they are
for the women only. These societies
also give an annual dinner

The more important affairs on the
social schedule, such as all-college and
fraternity dances, are arranged not to
exceed one a month, and several fra—
ternities always entertain on the same
evening in order that they may include
as many as possible of the women,
The policy of the college authorities

Department Crested Recently

This department of the scrvice was
created very recently. it was ﬁrst rec-
ommended in a report before congress
in January in which it was stated that
the morale of the men was being
greatly decreased by worry caused by
personal home troubles. Professor
Peck was among the ﬁrst men to be
appointed in the service. Professor
Peck stated that to his knowledge
the American army was the ﬁrst that
evcr supplied men to care for the many
tel troubles of its soldier-s.

Men in the ﬁeld, such as Professor
Peck, will be aided at home by a Civil-
ian Relief organization which is ale
ready well under way.

Professor Peck has been granted an
indeﬁnite leave of absence by the col-
lege in order that he may take up this
new work. illls classes will be divided
between Professors Payne and Lavell.

in leaving, Professor Peck said, "I
am sorry to leave my work and the
men, but I feel that, under the circume
stauccs, this temporary call for need-
ful work is the most important,”

Mr, H, G. Lyman, a prominent Gr

Poweslllek county, has been accepted
in the same service and expects to
leave some time next wcek.

A correspondence course in journale
ism, which is to be conducted by A. L.

Thc Very Young linistei Philip Avery
First Produced in New rork

“His Majesty Bunker Bean" was
drar 'lti'cd by Lee Wilson Dodtl from
liar - L. Wilson’s \vellelmown novel
and produced in the Astor'thcatcr in
Ncw York city, Oct. 2, late, with a
brilliant winter success.

In dl'amalltillg the novel .\ll'. Dodd
has preserved the original characters
of the story with a fullness that en
riches the doughtful‘ and gripping
lnovel.

"Bunker Beau," states the dramatic
critic ol"‘Tbe Nation," which is a
tit-ariiaticatlon of amusing pel'plexllies,
has quite the right nourish for farce
comedy. The writer wades thru the
extravagant with complete assurance
and succeeds in carrying his audience
with him. The stages by which a mod-
est stenogropher, possessing a streak
of the romantic, gains conﬁdence in
himself by the arthof a clairvoyant, and
at length marries the daughtcr of his
rich employer, do not impose too great
a tax upon the imagination owing to
the swift treatment. The use of the
supernatural element is indeed a'iape
py stroke." ‘

Plot ls Light

As a story the play is void of heavy
‘and complex situations. A weak un-
derling, a s’teuographer, not selﬂas-
sertive enough to make his way in the
world, is persuaded that he is the Pe»
incarnation of Napoleon, of an Egyp»
tmn monarch and of other strong char--
acters. Of course be is a fool to be—
lieve it and is not of the stuff to make
a hero except in a farcical 'uy.

The play gives the entire cast an
opportunity to give an audience a real
treat in college drama. in fact, the
play is an actor's play. Nearly every
one of the eighteen characters has am-
ple opportunity and their acting should
make the play one of the most einoy-
able shown ln the Colonial theater for
some time.
