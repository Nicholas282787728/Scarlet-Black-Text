OUR, PLATFORM FOR A BETTER GRINNELL COLLEGE

Promotee
Opportunities for Cultural Development.
. Greater Variety of Social Activities.
. Leadership and Scholarship.
. Band, Glee Club and Similar Organizations.
. Simpliﬁed Cut and Grade Systems.
. Improved Athletic Facilities.
. Improved Living Conditions.
. Chapel and Vesper Attendance.

WHAT OF THE FUTURE?

The action taken by the faculty committee on student
organizations and publications yesterday in voting approval
of additional funds for the band is at last definite proof
that something will be done for the band.

A‘most important part of the band lejuvenation pro—
gram has, however, not yet received final approval. It is
true that the committee on organizations and publications
voted favoring the giving of credit toward graduation for
participation in the band. Final approval of the proposal,
however, is up to the Curriculum committee.

Approval of this portion of the plan is essential to the
welfare of the band. In other words the future of the band
lies with the Curriculum committee.

WG—
IT CAN ,BE DONE

Definite action was taken yesterday by the faculty
committee on student organizations and publications to en-
courage centralized control of publications and the publh
cation of an annual.

Both proposals have long needed such action to make
them possible.

If the board of the Grinnell Student Publishing com-
pany Sees fit to accept the responsibility offered by the
committee, a great advance ill the publications setup on this
campus may be achieved.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

To the Editor of the
and Black:

This has been a banner year.
We've seen the reorganization of
several campus institutions, make
ing for a better Grinnell. But
we have yet to see the organiza-
tion of something else which
Grinnell also needs badlyian an-
nual.

 

 

izerestablish it have failed. Last
year, however, the idea gained a
firmer foothold. Definite interest
was shown.

I believe that Grinnell students
want an annual. The present
sophomore class, the logical pub-
lisher of the annual during its
Junior year, contains much edlr
tonal. artistic, and business [al-
cnt, enough to produce an annual
of the caliber Crinncll requires
and deserves.

But such a pl‘OJECE requires
campusAwide support and imme-
diate action. The decision must
be made this spring.

The Cyclones of thc past have
gone with the wind; they are
only raintly remembered breezes,
Since the publication of a Crin-
ncll annual ceased, movements to

There is just enough time left
this spring to make definite plans
and to start work on an annual
that will put Grinncll up among
the leaders. isuzanne Gillis.

NEWS OF THE WEEK
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

WASHINGTONeP r e s i d c n t
Roosevelt Thursday night, for the
first time in five months, spoke
to the people of the United States
in a “fireside chat,” explaining
the need for a i,_ billion dollar
“pump priming" program ans
nounced earlier the same day in a
message to Congress.

Itcminding the people that his
principal concern was for the weir
fare of the whole people, the
prcsident recommended his pro
posal as a means of building put»
chasing power, pointing out that
similar expenditures in the early
years of his administration had
increased the per capits wealth
of the nation far more than they
had increased the debt.

Specific proposals by the presi-
dent. sent to Congress Thursday,
included increased appropriations
for relief, public works. flood
control, housing, highways and
the like.

Immediate result of the presi-
dent's action was the release by
the treasury of $1,391,000,000 of
“sterilized" gold to swell the
credit resources of the nation. in-
sofar as this increase is effective,
there will need to be no increase
in the national debt.

Reaction to the plan was varied
with most experts agreeing that
busmess would be aided tempor-
arily. Many expressed fear that
continued use of such tactics
would lead to annual necessity
for them.

PARIS, FRANCE—Guided by
the strongest French cabinet in
many years under the leadership
of Premier Edouard Daladier,
France this week seemed on the
road to settlemcnt of many of
the problems facing her in the
past year.

Among the first acts of the
“national defense cabinet," was
the issuance of orders to striking
workers to get “back to work"

Purlmmcnt adjourned Tuesday
until May, leaving the govern-
ment in the hands of the cabinet,
approved Monday by the cham-
ber of deputies, 50842.

ROME, [TALYl—A step in the
direction of European peace, at
least for a few years. was taken
Wednesday by Premier Benito
Mussolini when he pledged him-
self to welcome British War Min-
ister Leslie Hodre—Belisha.

It the war mi . er carries out
his plans and goes to italy April
22, it will be the first time that
a British war minister has gone
to Italy on official business.

Such an action is considered a
definite step toward a strong un-
de standing for peace between the
