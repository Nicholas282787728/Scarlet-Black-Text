usual musical distinctions.

Miss Flynn, for instance, has
yet to pay for a music lesson.
This does not mean that she has
not had extensive voice training,
for she has. But each of her
teachers, recognizing one of
finest young voices in America,
has refused any payment for in-
struction.

Mr Berini, though a native
American like Miss Flynn, is or
Italian parentage. He can claim
a musical heritage of more than
150 years, for there have been
century and a half.

Both of the young soloists who
are appearing in the joint con-
cert here have won high critical
praise for the quality of their
voices and their musicianship.
Miss Flynn has appeared on a
number of occasions with the
Chicago City Opera company and
Mr. Berini is a favorite with Ra-
dio City Music Hall audiences,

By Russell Cain.

Senior students will not participate in the annual Grinnell
College Job Survey, according to an announcement made to-
day by Samuel N. Stevens, president of Grinnell College. The
job survey for seniors will be replaced by a series of senior

job seminars.

The annual Gl‘innell Job
Survey will be open to sopho—
mores and juniors this year,
and plans are being made to
hold it in Chicago, Minneap—
olis, St. Louis, and Des
Moines.

The plan, allowing- only sophoA
mores and juniors to participate
in the survey, will permit students
to contact heads of businesses and
corporations, who will give the
undergraduate an ovel'au picture
of that field, rather than referring
them to a personnel dirmtor,
Stevens said.

often were referred to the offices
of personnel directors for regular
job interviews. ‘

“The purpose or a job survey is
not to get jobs for students but
rathcr to give students on over—
all view of a field of work they
wish to enter. This information
can best be given by mcn who
rank high in that field, and these
men are interested in helping stun
dents in the preparation for a
field of work, but they are often
reticent to give their time to stu-
dents engaged in an actual job
hunt," Stevens said,

The job survey will be u‘nder the
direction of John C. Fctzer, assists
ant to the president, Calvin
Deming, dircctor of publicity
and an alumni committee to be
announced some time this month.

Differs on New Curriculum Change

liked the plan—wini reservations
iand three students were enthus-
iastic in their approbation.

Edward stone, senior: “The new
curriculum Sctdlp helps Grinneil
move from one class to another——
from the old fashioned to the pro-
gressive, It's the inevitable in
in successful educational policies
in a high grade school. It doubt-
less will cause a new problem in
Griuncll athletics.”

Margaret Grossmaill, junior: “I
like the new plan, but I wish
that it hadn’t happened in the
middle of my college life

Harold Kendall, senior: don’t

like the idea of Saturday classes
on account of basketball trips. It
will also hurt the working stu<
dents in my opinion. How-
ever, the ultimate plan may not
include working students."

Charlotte Brcbhee, junior: “It's
a good idea because the student
is allowed to concentrate on what
he is interested in."

Mollijeun Fiohr, sophomore:
“Perhaps it is a splendid plan,
but what happens to the student
if, after graduating in his speci-
fic field of work, he cannot then
