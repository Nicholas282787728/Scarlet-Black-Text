for PWAs to go out and lecture
about what it means to have AIDS.
Gray has found that some
organizations, including one in
Grinnell, are reluctant to host
PWAs because of the accompany-
ing stigma. “We got a call from the
Grinnell Hospice asking [or the
AIDS information tape we have,
but they didn’t want a speaker on
AIDS. It’s a reluctance to face the
reality that someone in your com-
munity could have it too,” says
Gray.

Gray describes his work With
PWAs as “very special and mean-
ingful. There‘s still such beauty in
those people, and yet they’re so
stigmatized.” He has encountered
PWAs who feel guilt, sometimﬁ
about both the disease and their
gayness, and others who have
none. Gray has witnessed several
patients who have drastically
changed their lifestyles upon
developing AIDS. ”One of my pa-
tients, Richard, was a gay, IV»drug
user, but when he got AIDS, that
all changed and he went clean,"
says Gray.

Paula Kelly, formerly a
counselor at the Red Cross Center
in Des Moines and a member of the
AIDS coalition in that city, asserts
that gay rwiis’ initial reactions to
diagnoses of the disease often de-
pend on how comiortable they are
with their homosexuality. She says
that all of the PWAs she has
counseled had no guilt, but. she has
heard of others who have blamed
themselves ior not being

monogamous.

The hysteria and ignorance sur-
rounding the disease have trig-
gered a backlash against gay
employment and legal rights,
believes Gray. Gray also reports a
peculiar AIDS phobia among many
gays. “Some gays are so scared
that they want to blame others. It’s
very easy to point fingers and say,
‘I'Ie’s promiscuous. that’s why he
got it,’ " says Gray.

Paula Kelly agrees that igr
norance and discrimination are
also present in the gay community.
Kelly, who presented an “AIDS
101” talk at Grinnell last year, has
heard or bartenders dropping
glasses and of other patrons
“literally running away” from
PWAs. “As a straight person, it’s
very easy for me to assume that
the gay community is wellaware
of this disease, but I know now that
that isn’t necessarily true. There’s
a lot oi denial among gays,” she
says.

Kelly says that much oi the
discrimination against PWAs is
“subtle stuff." One PWA she knew,
Michael, was covered in blue-black
Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions. a skin
cancer common among PWAS.
“Whenever he went out, people
would stare or cringe at the sight of
him.” remembers Kelly. Kelly
says Michael learned to deal with
the staring by “staring right back
and asking, “Like what you see,
darling? "

Kelly worries that a consequence
of the, media’s sensationalist
coverage at AIDS will be the
equating of sex with death. “I want
tobeath ' 'nls ",

because there‘s going to be a lot of
iuckedup, repressed people in this
country," says Kelly. She says that
ultimately people have to be
educated that “it isn't sex that
kills, but unsaie sex.”

In her work presenting “AIDS
101” lectures. Kelly has seen much
ignorance among healthcare
workers, Referring to one presen-
tation at a nursing home, Kelly
describes the nurses and atten-
dants as “blocked. There were
some people who see AIDS as a
conspiracy [and who believe that]
some of the facts about transmis-
sion are being kept secret," says
Kelly. She believes that the few
cases of health-care workers' be-
ing infected by the AIDS Virus
were freak accidents. “You can
‘what if’ things to death, but there
is always potential for the
bizarre.”

Volunteer

Brian Kirkpa k, chairperson
of the information line of the Gay
Coalition of Des Moines, works as a
“buddy” to PWAs and, like Gray
and Kelly, presents “AIDS 101"
education workshops in Iowa. Bud-
dies periorm various tasks.
“Sometimes all you do is go and sit
with the person at the doctor's 0‘,
ﬁles, or perhaps get groceries for
them, or just take them out ior a
drive. You're just someone who's
with them. Most times buddies
don't get involved in deeper
aspects of health care,“ says
Kirkpatrick. Buddies also allow
lovers and family members a
respite lrom the stress oi caring
for a PWA.

AIDS oiten causes memory loss
and, eventually, dementia in many
PWAS. Consequently, some PWAs
appear completely lucid one day,
and the next are Confused and
“even unable to remember who
you are and what is your name,"
says Kirkpatrick. “When you‘re a
buddy, you have to have a great
deal of patience. Sometimes you
have to repeat sentences three or
{our times beiore they
remember."

Kirkpatrick states that buddies
often have to overcome their own
irrational fears about AIDS. He
recalls one incident when he was
lifting a PWA from his bed into a
wheelchair. “He was sweating pro-
tuseiy, and as l litted I noticed a
small graze on my arm. I knew
that I couldn't get it from sweat,

but for a moment I 'ust lroze."
Sam] worker

Social worker Joan Christensen
had a similar experience at a
meeting of PWAs. “There was a
guy there who drove three hours
every week to be part of the
meeting. He had large KS lesions
all over his body and the first time
I hugged him I had this gross feel-
ing." Christensen told the man
about her reaction, and she was
moved by his response.“He looked
at me and said, ‘lmagine having to
stand in front of a mirror and look
at yourself.’ I didn't know what to
say to him,” ‘

A social worker {or 17 years, the
last three of which have been
devoted to working with PWAS,
Christenson of Des Moines Mercy

damentalist household, Christen-
son says that she had never known
anyone who was gay beiore she
began her work with PWAs.
Nonetheless, she believes working
with PWAs has enriched her lif
“I like working with this illness in
that it has helped me meet some or
the neatest people I know,” she
says.

Christensen organizes three sup-
port workshops, one ior PWAs;
another for people with AIDS
Related Complex (ARC), a less
acute but often fatal form of the
disease; and one for individuals
who have tested HIV positive. For
the AIDS and ABC groups,

HIV positive

In the HIV group, where people
have tested positive for the AIDS
virus yet have not developed
symptoms of the disease, different
issues are covered. “In the HIV
group, people are more concerned
with communication, establishing
relationships, future planning, and
minimizing their reactions to AIDS
symptoms it they develop them.”
Christensen adds that stress
management is particularly inr
portant to diminish icars about
developing the disease.

Presently healthy (one states
that he is healthier “than I’ve ever
been in my lite”), two Des Moines
gay men who have tested HIV
positive say that the specter oi
AIDS is no less ominous. Luke. a
27ryear-Old Otturnwa native, had
just started seeing someone two
years ago when they both elected
to take blood tests. Although
Luke's test was negative, his
lover's was positive.

“I just assumed that I must have
got the virus too, but the antibodies
hadn't had time to develop,” he
says. Six months later, after the
relationship ended, Luke once
again had a blood test and this time
tested positive.

Having the virus has altered the
priorities in his life. “I think twice
about making long-term plans
now. For instance, setting up an

IRA is secondary to what I'm going.

to be doing today tor myseli. It‘s
important to strive to be truly hap-
py.” The virus has also limited his
job options. “I was thinking about
changing my job, perhaps moving
to another city, but that would be
hard,” he says. "My present job
has a great benefit plan, but AIDS
is classiiied as a preexisting con-

 

diuon by insurance agencies so I’d
lose my benefits if I moved on."

Bert, also 27 and originally from
St. Louis, says he has no guilt and
blames no one {or his contracting
the disease. “No one did this inten-
tionally to me. I’m an adult. I did
what I wanted to do, and I can't
hold anyone responsible except
me."

AIDS has paralyzed the gay
community with fear, according to
Bert. “Gays are doing one oi three

To Western ears, the pipa, a lyre-
like instrument from China, has an
enigmatic, unusual sound, Last
weekend, Tang Liang Xing, one oi
the ioremost pipa players in the
People's Republic of China, visited
Grinnell and, with Andrew Hsieh
and David Liang, performed a con-

,cert oi traditional and classical
Chinese music. In an interview
with the Scarlet and Black,
translated by Grinnell student
Chin YLI, Tang described his
musical background, the turbulent
years oi the Cultural Revolution,
and his present his in the us,

, Born in Shanghai to a large
musical iamily (all oi his siblings
and -both oi his parents play
musical instruments), Tang was a
precocious musician. At the age oi
13 he began to receive iormal ins
struction from two or Shanghai’s
leading musicians. Three years
later, Tang entered the Shanghai
Chinese Music Orchestra School
and began to periorm with the
Shanghai Chinese Musical 0r»
chestra, rang also performed with
the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra
as a pipo soloist and worked with
the Central Symphony Orchestra
oi China.

With the advent of the Cultural
Revolution in 1966. Tang’s public
periormances came to an end.
However, while he concedes that
his case was perhaps exceptional,
Tang says that the Iii—year hiatus
did not have an adverse eiiect on
his musical career. “The Cultural
Revolution gave me the chance to

practice more. to reiinc my crait.
There was more time to concen-
trate on my music,” says Tang.
After the Cultural Revol ion
coded in 197s. Tang went to Beijing
and participated in a national per
iormance competition, ultimately
garnering the championship
medal. He was invited to play ior
the National Musical Conservatory
in Beijing. With the conservatory,
Tang was able to travel abroad to
Japan. Switzerland, France,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.
The so-called “Open Door"
policy oi the midvlSBDs gave many
Chinese artists the opportunity to
travel and study abroad. Tang
came to the US. in September 1986

‘to study languages at Queens Col-

lege in New York. In addition to
studying there, he has joined die
local orchestra and has since
played in Denver, Chicago, New
York. and Grinnell.

Living in the U.S. has given Tang
the opportunity to adapt Western
music to the traditional style of
Chinese music. “I'm not trying to
copy Western music but just to
develop modern Chinese music,"
he says. Tang believes that the
cultural diversity represented in
the us. provides a unique artistic
milieu for the musician. “In
America, there is the spirit of a
mix of cultures like there is in no
other country. I’ve learned a lot
Iron-i the diiierent types or music,
and I wouldn‘t have been exposed
to them in China,” he says.
