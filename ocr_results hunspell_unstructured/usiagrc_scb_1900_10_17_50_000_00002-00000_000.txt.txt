Qﬁhitoriul

Two FEATURES of last Satur-
day’s football game should never
again be repeated in Grinnell.
Did the students of the college
turn out to see a funeral? Or was
it a Sundayrschool picnic? Or
was it merely an exhibition of
football involving no feeling ot
loyalty to the school and to be‘
viewed only from an impartial
and disinterested standpoint? A
stranger would have said that any
one of these suppositions might
have hit the truth. To be sure,
the crowd occasionally leaned
forward an inch or two over the
side lines when their ﬁeld of
vision was obstructed, but other»
wise it had wonderful self-control.
and was withal a most modest,
unresponsive and unenthusiastic
collection of sightrseersgnothing
more. The idea of team. work is
constantly drilled and hammered
into the football men. The same
idea of team work ought to be
hammered with triple force into
the student body. The student
body isﬁrst, last and always re-
sponsible for encouraging the
team by systematic cheering. ut-
terly regardless of the ups and
downs of the score Enthusiastic
cheering has been known to win
a game. whereas scarcely a hearty
and concerted yell disturbed the
balmy air ot Saturday last. The
student body should never be
guilty of a repetition of this per-
formance. Criticism number two
applies solely to the management.
The bills announced that a game
would be played, whereas the
spectators were actually allowed
to see only the ﬁrst half and
about one-third of the second
half, The management has some
slight ground upon which to base
the action taken in regard to the
second half. It was a matter of
very great accommodation to the
Cornell manager to be able to
leave town on the afternoon train.
This kind and obliging act, howr
ever, involved a great big Mai
the Cornell aggregation was ac
commodatcd. bit! the spectators,
who should receive the ﬁrst con—
sideration, were simply cheated
out of a part of their just duet
Managers should consider such
things and take a look at the fu-
ture results before committing
themselves,

SCARLET AND BLACK a short re-
view Dt Proft Macy’s new book.—
"Political Parties in the United
States" We regret that more
space could not be'given tor this
purpose. The publication of a
book like this by so eminent an
authority as Prof. Macy, is an
event of more than passing inter-
est. It is.of interest, not only to
the students in the college, and
other friends of the author, but
is of importance to all students of
political science. This book is a
distinct and important contribu-
tion to the literature on that Sub-
ject. Prof. Macy can. well be
proud of his work. We congrat-
ulate him upon his success.

Handicap Hundl-edt

The Home Field-meet has been
a very peculiar liind of an affair
this year. Ordinarily all tile sevr
enteen events are run off in one
atteinoon, but, owingto untoward
circumstances, the meet this fall
was reduced to the handicap litldr
dred-yal'd dash, and even that was
accomplished on the installment
plan, The Saturday’s issue con-
tained an account of three heats
and the ﬁnal of those heats. But
Conger, the scratch man, being
absent, the ﬁnal heat proper was
not. run off until Thursday after-
noon. Spaulding was placed on
the sevenryard mark, and Conger
on the scratch. spaulding won
the race with barely two-thirds of
a yard to the good Time, [0%
seconds.

This closes the track work for
the season The results have been
satisfactory, besides affording
good preliminary practice for
