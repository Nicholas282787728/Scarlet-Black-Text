People who choose not to out

Meat eoicrs are eating mindlessly,
which is a spiritual lapse of the ﬁrst
order. Adams pointed out that meat
eaters didn’t even realize (until the
hystctia over mail cow disease) that
cows, natiiral herbivores, are being
riiriietl into Cannibals by being fed
rendered cows. Rendering involves
turning the waste uflhc slaughtered
animals, thehrains,spinnlcoros,erc,,
into animal feed. It is believed that
mad cow tlisensc is a result orieetiing
to beef cows soinc rendered sheep
which had the disease.

Adams also said that most meat
eaters are also not aware of the fact
that chickens in the United States
are fed their own feces m an attempt
to cut down on waste. Moreover, she
evploineri that a new glue has been
patenttil to glue chickens' oniises
shut, so that they are unable to defe-
catc when they are slaughtered. Pres—
ently, “fecal splatter” contaminates
chicken flesh when the animals def»

Adams then linked rrieot eating

Adams, are all part of the domina-

that dairy and egg products are “femr

Why Pig Out! Made
People Bug—out

by Aaron Gross

“Meat is Murder" was the
slogan of the vegetarian cam—
paigns :il Grinnell 8 and 9 years
ago. lnsteatl of the pictures of
sows in confinement systems and
cute pigs that SAD put up this
year, the “Meat is Murder“came
paign was accompanied by graph—
ic shots of slaughtered animals.
One might think that the more
aggresswe and graphic “Meat is
Murder" campaign would have
drawn more ire and more com«
ploiiits, interesting, the teverse
has been true. So we must ask,
why did PlgOtitl caused so many
people to hugout when previous
vegetarian campaigns on [he
ounnell campus have had corn.
paratively small effects?

The answer, I believe, is that
the Pig Out! campaign success»
fully did what Carol Adams Clo»
scribes as “restoring the absent
referent;” that is, the campaign
successfully reminded us their we
are consuming the flesh of
Choppethup dead cows, pigs, or
birds, when we sit down to a
meal of “beef," “pork," or "poul-
try." More importantly, thecnni.
paignreniindecl listhateach cow,
pig, or bird was a fully sentient
living being, who, as the posters
described it, had a face, Meat is
Murder remtnclecl people that
they were eating hunks of dead
animols, out it did not go further
and remind people that the dead
animal tissue on our plates, was
once a living being. When the
Pig Out! campaign took this fur—
ther step—when it pointed out
the fact that before pig flesh was
“out" food it was someone’s lifei
the campaign disturbed people.

Anotherway to put this is to
say that the Pig Out.‘ campaign
successfully exposed the myth
that animals used for food are
“things" rather than living ber
ings. We nslt “what is for clin.
net?" However. the more accu—
rate and descriptive way to ask
this question when dead animals
are served is “who is for dinner?"

How much era response tlitl
SDAE get when they ”restored
ihc ahsent referent," during the

numerous letters to the editor were
written to the 3&B; SDAE’s rental
ofa pig—suit became a news story in
itself; a debate on veginisrn was
called; one floor meeting was called
because of our posters; it was dee

The conipnigiiivns a big success
for the cause ofvegetarianism also.
l know several people who became
vegetarians, solidified an experi—
riiental vcgctsirionisin, or who he.

“People want to bee
licvc the myth that ani—
mals are humanely raised
and ‘humanely slaughr
tered’ when it is clearthat
they are not raised hue
maricly and that killing is
not a ‘humane' thing to

do.”

ganveganasatesultofthecampaign,
Large amounts of literature were dis»
tributed to people and over 50 Grine
nell students requested more inforr
tnation on vegetarianism. SDAE
rnernhership went up significantly.
SDAE won the vegan debate by a
large margin. Finally, and most im—
portantly, several people prayiously
uninvolved with SDAE became ac-
tive members,

All this happened as the result
of SDAE putting up posters, tabl'mg,
and a single features page devoted to
the campaign, These small actions
attracted so much attention because
the campaign restored the absent
referent.

Many students at Grinnell were
under the false impression that veg»
etorianisni is merely a personal pref.
ercnce and that meateeating is also a
personalpteference. Eatingdeadanr
iinnls isntorin ofvioleiice,niid though
we iiiiist all make a personal choice
tostop participating in this violence.
it is not merely a mater of personal
“preference.”TheFigOut‘. campaign
made this situation clear,

Students often complained that
the Pig outl campaign was “sctism
tionalistic” and then argued that the

campaign attracted so much atr
tention because ofits sensational
quality. But when we pause to
think about it, there is nothing
sensational about simply stating
thefactthat90%ofpigs are raised
inconfmement systems orsaying
that the animals we eat have fac-
es. If anything, the campaign
should have been criticized for
pointing out the obvious.

For anyone who doubts that
theeffectivenessofrhe campaign
was rooted in the fact that it
reminded people that meat was
once a living being, I encourage
the followrng thought experi—
ment. Ask yourself what would
happen if you put up aposterthat
said:“your food hada root;"would
this cause any stir.7 Now imagine
that a poster is put up that says
“your food had a face.” Clearly.
the response will be different, as
we have seen first hand at Grin-
nell. Now aslt yourscli why the
responses to these two types of
posters would be so different?

Mostpeopie wouldgetnuth»
ing but pleasure fromtaisingtheir
own carrots and then pulling
them out from the soil to be eat-
en. But most meat-eaters would
be very disturbed by the task of
raising a pig, slitting his or her
throat, draining the blood from
his or her body, and consuming
his or her flesh. Though ethical
vegetarians will surely Object to
vegetable production when it in
valves abuses of human labor,
vegetarians will not get offended
when someone poincs out that
they are “eating a carrot which
was ripped out of the dirt." How—
ever, most meat—eaters will ger
offended if you say “you are eate

dead cow who had his or her
throat cut and the blood drained

comfort people have with eating
meat. People want to believe the
myth that animals are humanely
raised and “humanely slaugh<

are not raised humanely and that

do. Even worse, people don‘t
