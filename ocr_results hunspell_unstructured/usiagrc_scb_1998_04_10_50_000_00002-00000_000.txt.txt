Repercussions of Proposition 209 debated

Continued from page 1
end afﬁrmative action in 1995 riv—
eted national attention on Cnlifomia.

Supporters of affirmative action
vociferously protested the decision,
calling it destructive to the goal of
diversity.

“They were really intent on stir-
ring up trouble rather than ivith deal-
ing with the probleiiis."‘he said.

The uproar caused by the regents’
action persuaded Connerly to accept
what he saw as a more important
task: to end affirmative action in all
state hiring and promoting.

As chair of the California Civil
Rights Initiative, Connerly is widely

; Credited for placing the 1996 refer
endum on the ballot. By a narrow
majority, California voters accepled
State Proposition 209. which banned
the use of immutable characteristics
like race. gender or national origin
in state actions and programs.

After court appeals against the ini-
tiative failed in 1997, supporters and
opponents anxiously waited for the
ﬁrst round of university admissions
statistics, which were released last
week.

They show that nearly 14 percent
fewer Native American, Latino/a and
black applicants were admitted to the
state’s nine public universities this
year. Some campuses. including
Berkeley, Saw more than a 50 per-

Weeklies

, cent drop in black admissions.

But Connerly said three “historic
cally under-represented" schools saw
increases in its minority admissions
rate.

“On the fztcc of it, I am pleased
with the way it‘s turning out," he
said. “Systemewide, there is very
little change."

Critics of the initiative said the
increases in some schools do not balr
ance the losses in others—and that
the problem of under-representation
in the more prestigious schools will
only grow worse.

Questioned by a student on the
virtue of diversity, Connerly ac-
knowledged it as an ideal he values.

“We had said we have to have di-
vctsity and we'll strive for excele
lence, rather than having excellence
and striving for diversity," he said.
“Diversity is not a compelling rea-
son to give some of you preference
over me." he said.

Kamil E. Redmond, a Harvard
student, asked Connerly whether he
believed racism still pervaded
America's institutions and said a true
merilocracy did not exist in univer-
sity admissions procedures.

Connerly agreed that the UC sys»
tem was not,“a pure academic
meritoeracy," and noted that schools
are now instructed to admit as much
as 50 percent of their classes based

upon what Connerly called “supple
mental factors" like creativity, tenace
ity and the ability to overcome ob—
stacles

Cheryl L Jones told Connerly that
she “no doubt" had beneﬁted from
affirmative action in Califomla and
worried that its abolition would pre»
vent people with “disadvantaged
backgrounds" from succeeding.

Connerly responded that Califore
nia regents are focusing their attenr
tion on lower performing schools.

Recently. Connerly came out in
favor of n proposal to double the
spending on under performing
schools—and said Wednesday that
he favors afﬁrmative action based on
socioeconomic differences.

The Forum audience heeded mod»
erator Alan K, Simpson's careful
admonition to respect Connerly, a
controversial conservative speaking
to a liberal campus.

Jerry Weinstein, an editor for a
local university press, said he “en-
tirely disagreed" with Connerly’s
argument.

“The lack ofiinderstanding of the
consequences of [Proposition 209]
is...astounding," Weinstein said.

Other students felt Connerly's
views were not as radical.

“For all those who are angry at
Ward Connerly, the anger should be
directed towards California voters,"

Several students said the most
controversial remark of the evening
came from Harvey C. Mansfield.
who introduced Connerly.

Mansfield, who is Keitan Profes-
sor of Government. began his rc-

mark: by calling Connerly “a great

black thinker" and lauded him for
standing up for his views. “The great-
est black thinkers have always dis-
agreed," he said.

Mansfield said that African
Americans today face two compet—
ing visions of racial reconciliation.

“Martin Luther King is a most
honored black. Malcolm X is the
most fashionable." Mansﬁeld 5610,

Al the beginning of his speech,
Connerly gingerly rcproached
Mansﬁeld for the introduction,

“My reason for being in the whole
mess is the presumption that my skin
color should be relevant in my pub—
lic policy decisions. It should not be
relevant!" he said.

After Connerly‘s speech, angry
students confronted Mansﬁeld at the
Forum about his introductory re-
marks.

Jobe G. Danganan said
Mansﬁeld's comparison of King and
Malcolm X was “extremely offene
sive," while Redmond said she was
“outraged” by the remark.

Mansﬁeld refused to comment.

who will make use of the opportuni-
ties that Grinnell's assets provide.
Professor Jack Mutti said the
canidates must be “agents for
change. . .a good catalyst," Powell
agreed. saying that the committee
looks for “someone who can moti-
vate and bring people together to
work in moving Grinnell forward."

Powell also cited “a deep com—
mitment to the liberal arts“ as a nec-
essary characteristic. The committee
also seeks a dedication to diversity.
Dobbs elaborated, noting that intel-
lectual diversity, as well as racial and
cultural diversity. is important.

Committee members mention that
candidates with such attributes can
easily ﬁnd jobs elsewhere. Dobbs
said, “We have more need of them
than they have of us." Mutti agreed,
“ it is important [to convince] people
that this is an opportunity that ought
to be looked at more carefully,”

Noted Holland, “Sometimes there's
a weird separation between FTP and
EAG for no apparent reason. It was
nice to See us go this time as friends."

Hustings and Schapira also indi-
cated positive reactions to the con-
ferences. Said Hustings, “I think
going to conferences like this one
pumps some energy into our group.
People who will be in charge next
year and in the future got a lot of
good ideas for fund raising, learned
some important facts about poverty
and homelessness, and got to talk to
groups that have been successful.
Going to this conference helps us
take advantage of international
knowledge, helps us be more closely
involved, and helps motivate
people."

Schapira said, “The conference
left us with a certain amount of em-
powerment, It...broadened our
sights...and [showed us] how we can
structure ourselves to become the
most effective group we can be," In
relation to the function of SOL,
Schapira said. the conference would
help facilitate SOL’S plans “to in-
crease our membership and hope-
fully interact with the various Latino
communities around the state ...to do
good within the communities...We
have big hopes and ideas for next
year.“

cation commitments in favor of his
new programs. For example. while
Republicans increase funds to edu-
cate disabled children by $2.5 billion,
the President does not even fund this
program at the rate of inflation," the
release said.

But student lobbyists do not feel
the Senate proposal fairly addresses
student aid needs.

“We agree that there’s not enough
money there [for higher education]
and it reﬂects poorly on the Senate’s
commitment to education," said
Erica Adelsheimer, United States
Student Association legislative direc-
tor.

Adelsheimer said the Senate did
not support initiatives to help low-
income students.

“They’re not willing to put their
money where their mouth is,” she
said. “There‘s not enough money for
Pell Grants“ and other programs to
help iow income students.
