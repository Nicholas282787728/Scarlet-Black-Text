College short term energy outlook good

b ‘ Hob Mitchell
Despitc t critical energy shore
tage in the East and an increase in
the demand for energy for heat use
here, Grinnell College laces no
cdiate danger of an energy
rtage this winter, according to
Physical Plant Director Dale
Hawn.
But Hawn Warned that the
. "npus community must be
gleeful about not wasting energy
and said that the college “is not yet
out at the woods” regarding energy
conservation
Currently, heating requirements
are rcspons'blc [or two-thirds ol
the colleges total energy con»
sumption. The college has been
relying on both natural gas and oil
lnr heating fuel, but since

November thf'rt: hats been no
natural gas, iliuvii hays he has
been reassured lty the college’s Dll
supplier that there will he no
shortage of fuel oil this winter,

”We're in constant touch with
the marketing dwision of Standard
Oil, We've been advised that under
current conditions they have
adequate product to meet our
needs,” he said.

Huwn did indicate, however, that
there was a problem in January,
when an oil reiinery in Sugar
Creek. Missouri broke down, in-
terrupting their ability to produce
heating oil.

The extremely
peratures this winter have
produced an unprecedented
demand for heat. This demand l5

measured in "tome
poi-attire degree day a tigurc
which indicates the a cunt of built
needed tor enmtort. According to
Ilawii, at the and or January the
college had already accuiiiu tetl
4,912 degree days. At the same
time last year, the college had
totalled 3,756. In the winter of 1970-
71, the coldest recorded winter
since this one, 4,322 degree days
had been run up by this time. Thus,
the college is running about 25 per
rent ahead of last year in terms oi
the amount of heat needed and
about 15 per cent ahead of 1970771:
This year the college will use some
349,000 gallons of oil, 250,000 of
which have been consumed
a] only

Since 1971774l the Winter of the

Arab uti embargo, the loge has
engaged in what lltiWIl terms
"quick fix" prog m at energy
rtinst: alion. This program relies
priiiiai y on mechanical and
phy ul adjustments that do not
require major capital investment.
At the resent time, the college is
taking lie lollowing steps to lower
energy consumption:

rMinimiztng ll exhaust systems
and reconditioning heated air
already in the plant;

iliowcring temperatures in the
dormitories as much as possible
within the temperature control
ilnits (ideally, the temperature
should be 63 degrees in all dorms
on campus. yet this is not possible
because at a number at structural
and physical factors. Thus, tem-

peratures in the dorms range
at 'Wltei‘e l'i-tiiii till to 74 tlcgi-eesi;
ttucuig temperatures in all

cl srooin buildings at night;
ireducing the temperatures in tlll
unoccupied huilduigs during break
to 45 to as degrees;
erunning mechanical systems
within buildings on time clocks,
7})haslltg in individual radiator
valves in the dormitories;
~illtLl monitoring and lowering the
temperature at hot water

These "quick lix" methods,
according to llawn, have resulted
in substantial reductions in the
production or heat here. neat
production, measured by pounds or
steam produced, has dropped from
75,000,0th in 197243 to 58,000,000
pounds last year.
