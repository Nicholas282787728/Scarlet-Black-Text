day, The tesolutions addtessed
dissatisfaction with the tecent ad-
ministtative decision not to tenew
two student Attaits positions that
will be vacated at the end or the
ﬁscal yeat.

“it appeats elcat that the pte—
vious public administtative tee
sponses to the student complaints
about the changes in student 3f»

ability on the patt orthe admin—
isttation," said Klaetsch as he
handed the tesolutions to Presi—
dent Osgood. “While we note that
the administtation has given tea—
sons rot theit budgetaty decisions,

I believe it is sate to say that the
teasons tot the ptevious decisions
do adequately addtess

you take ownetship otthe budgctt

which adequately addtesses the

the student voice."

osgood, who had not yet seen
the tesolutions, ptomised to tead
them and ofﬁcially tespond at a
latet date.

The ritst tesolution, which was
