TODAY FOR the ﬁrst time since
the S. U. I.—Grinnell football game
last tall, a team representing the
State University meets us on our
own grounds. Whatever the out-
come of the game may be we are
sure that both teams will be ac-
tuated to do their best not simply
by a desire to win but with that
gentlemanly spirit which has come
to be a tradition in the games be-
tween the two institutions. While
the winning or losing of game will
in no way attect our chance of res
taining the silver bat, for the honor
of the school we sincerely hope
that the team will put up as pluck'y
a game as they did last Saturday.

The COLLEGE and town at Grine
nell owe it to Prof. Rossetter G.
Cole to aid him in every possible
way to make the subscription
concert series of next year as sucr
cessful as this year’s series has
been. Hehas during the past week
addressed a circular letter to the
subscribers of the concert series
giving the announcement as far
as he is able of the concerts for
the coming season, Only two can
be announced now, Mr. Clarence
Eddy, organist. who will appear
sometime late in October and the
Spiering String Quartet which met
so hearty a reception at their re-
cent appearance in this city, on
December Io, 1898. of the third
concert Prof. Cole says, “The
choice of the soloist or soloists
will depend on the number of the
subscribers to the series; and
herein lies the advantage of the
subscription system. By know-
ing betore hand how much money
can be available for the series, all
above actual local expenses can
be put into the securing of artists

 

ofrecogn ed ability and reputa-Q
tion, tor the giving of the series
is in no sense a ﬁnancial venture
The greater the number ot subs
scribers, the ﬁner the artists for
the series. a a The series will
not be given unless the standard
of the series just ended can be
maintained." It is a matter or
duty tor everyone connected with
the college or in any degree in
terestcd in securing the best edu»
cational advantages to our insti»
tution to co-opel‘ate with Prof.
Cole in making this series a per-
manent thing.

Telegrams irom Chicago
nouneing the results of the various
events in the Western Intel-col-
legiate meet are being received
constantly at this oIﬁce. Up to
time of going to press the follmw
ing are the results:

Maybury won the ﬁrst heat or
the IOO-yard‘ dash in 10 reg secs.
Rush sccond. The fact that the
track is reported soft and that this
is simply a preliminary race may
account for the slow time.

In the Mile Walk, Minnesota
won ﬁrst place in 7:26; Illinois,
second; and Michigan third.

In the High Jump, Wisconsin
won ﬁrst and third places; Michi-
gan, second.

In the Shot-Put, Wisconsin, De
