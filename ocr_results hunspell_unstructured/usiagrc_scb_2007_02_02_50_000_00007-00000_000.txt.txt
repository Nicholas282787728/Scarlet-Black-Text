Nestled behind tinted windows, stepping Stones Christian
Bookstore and More seems like a natural addition to downtown
Grinnell: a store that provides religious inspiration and spiritual
guidance in a community with twelve Christian churches.

Even for non»Christian patrons, the store is welcoming and
comfortable. It's unobtrusive on a street that sees constant traf-
ﬁc to Saint's Rest and Wells Fargo. The shelves are lined with
religious and secular products alike. Bible covers and Christian
artwork share space with graduation announcements and sticks
ers.

“We give inspiration when necessary," says owner Mindy

Uitermarkt started Stepping Stones four and a half years
ago, hoping to fill a "void in the [Grinnell] community"
Though most of her customers are women, Uitermarkt says
that the store draws people of all ages With its wide range of
products, “Our bestrselling items are books and gift items,"she
says, “but we also sell a lot of music and greeting cards."

Though few would describe the Grinnell college campus
as fervently religious, Uitcrmarkt says that community’s m,
sponse to Stepping Stones has been overwhelmingly positive.
“People are always saying that they're so glad we’re here,“ she
says. “They’re glad they don’t have to go out of town to find in-
spirational products."Uitermarkt also owns a smaller branch of
Stepping Stones in New Sharon, where she rents out the front
ofher mother's business to house her products,

Uitermarkt encourages Grinnellians to stop by and visit

the store, whatever their religious affiliations. “We love it when
Grinnell College students come in,” she says. She is enthusias-
tic about assisting both customers and community members in
their personal spiritual journeys, and describes her own church
—Grinnell United Methodisrias “very welcoming."

For now, the bookstore employs seven adults and high
school smdentsﬂ group that Uitermarkt hopes will soon in—
clude more students.

““It is helpful if our employees have a Christian faith," she
says. “But we’re looking for employees who find fulﬁllment in
helping people,"

Uitetmarkt hopes to continue to meet and acknowledge the
diversity otthc Grinnell community’s needs. “We try to have
something for everyone," she says. “We’re about Christian faith,
but we’re also about inspirational, feel-good things."

Building inclusion at Grinnell

The Forum was inaccessible to the disabled, how does the JRC compare?

Bv BEN WEVL

Grinnell likes to see itselfas an inclusive institution, a place
where people orevery color, and creed are welcome. But one
type of student is noticeably absent from campus: students
in wheelchairs. And in the last 25 years there have only been
two. Grinnell likely lacks handicapped students for multiple
reasons, but one of the simple facts about this campus is that it
is not very handicapraccessible. The new campus center is an

improvement, but it is hardly perfect.
, According to Ralph savarcse, English and co-chair of the

Ad I-loc Committee on Issues ofDisabilitics at Grinnell, the

JRC is much more ltaudieappcdracccr
sible than the Forum, which had one nar
row ramp and no automatic doors. “The
Forum was teiribly inaccessible. I love the
Foiuin, but the building was really not
meant for anyone with physical disabilis
tics, We now have a campus center that is
actually accessible."

But savarcse said the building could
have been even more accessible. “There is
a big difference between ADA [Amerir
cans with Disabilities Act]rcompliant and
ADArgenerous,” he said. “Even though
they might satisfy the letter of the law,
they are not really as accessible or accom-
modating as they might be,"

While there are two ramps on either side of the building.
Savarese expressed disappointment that there was no iamp gar
ing into the front entrance of the building, not an automatic
door at the front. “Why, at the main entrance, where you would
enter for dining, where you would enter for the elevators, is
there no entrance)" he asked.

According to Tom Crady, Vice President for Student Sets
vices, that issue was raised during the deliberations with the
architect but the choice was to have the two ramps closer to the
parking lots on either side oftlic building.

Wheelchairs are also unable to pass over the railroad tracks
on the paved walkway leading from East Campus (the only
completely halidicnppedraccessible dorm) to the JRC. Brianne
Benncss '08, who temporarily used a wheelchair Lifter foot stirs
gery, called crossing the tracks “impossible" in an email. “Be»
cause of the railroad tracks, I either had to get out of my chair
and hop over the tiacks (which I was lucky to be able to do) or
have somebody push really hard at different angles which didn't
always work anyway."

savarese said the asphalt needs to be paved more evenly.
According to Crady, however, there is not much
the college can’ do about it since the railroad
company owns that property "We've tried to
deal with that," he said, “We can raise those is-
sues with them but they are the folks who actu-
ally have to make the corrections to it."

Despite his criticisms, Savarese praised the
administration’s receptiveness. “We do have an
administration that is inclined to work with
us,” he said. “We’re very fortunate to have ad-
ministrators who are genuinely sensitive to this
thing."

Crady, who has an artiﬁcial hip and has used
a canein the past, said the college should make
it easier for people with disabilities to attend
Grinnell and that the JRC‘s new features were
a step in the right direction. He said that the net that only two
students in wheelchairs have attended Grinnell in the last 25
years is “a concern."

savarcse agreed.“lfwe want to think ofourselves as a really
inclusive, progressive, socially committed place, we have to ask
ourselves: what are we doing to include this other segment of
the population?" he said."1t‘s a long haul. I think we're a little _
bit behind, but I think we can get thcrc.1wouldn’t be here ifl
didn't think we could.”
