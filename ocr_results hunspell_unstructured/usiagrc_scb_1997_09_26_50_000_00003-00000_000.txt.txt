0111i Callison, lite celebrity Dr'-
recior of Housing, mired last year
and is currently living in town,
spending her little vacationing and
willi lie: grandchildren [recently
interviewed her over lunch at JD '5,

5&1}: How did you get started at
Grinncll?

Oda: I started as a secretary. I
really wanted to Work at the college
since I had four kids, not much
money, and needed the educational
assistance Ireally liked it You don't
have to be a student here to get an
education from Gi-inncll. I started
III the Office Ol'Development, Wthi’l
I didn‘t like, because I was Isolated
from contact with students, A job
eventually opened up in the Dean of
Men’s office, and Igot it.

5&3: How long ago was that?

Odn: Oh, gcez 30 years.

5&3: The 60’s, then. What was
the college like back then?

Oda: Those were super high
blood pressure daysl With Vietnam
and all the changes in the college, the
co-ed issue, the beginning ofthc drug
issuc,,,vel’y different times. I was a
very Conservative Iowan farm girl. In
part that’s why Ileft. I felt the pen-
dulum swinging back these last few
years. not that it’s a conservative
school, by ally means. The new
drinking rules are a good example. I
found myselfchallenging people in
the administration I wasn’t per
ceived as authoritarian enough. I
perceived them as not seeing things
in the long term.

5&1}: You mentioned that you
saw the beginning of the drug debate.
That hasn't ended yet, has it?

Oda: Not really. I remember
when a couple of the deans entered
the dorms and found some students
smoking pot. They were suspended
and it was a huge issue. Those were
different times. Men could live off—
cuinpus and women couldn’t. Once,
a guy found out his giilfriend was
living ol’tlciimpus with other men,
and he told the administration. The
girl was suspended, even though,

ueekmglsaek, ilrwas-jtustmamsea o£ mas—i-fLwas holding a popularity con:

simplejealousy,

In the ‘70s. the drug problem
was horrendous. It was a revolving
door policy, run by students. People
were having very bad trips and load
ing in the hospital. but the hospital
didn’t know how to deal with It since
no one knew much about it, so stu»
dents volunteered to help bring those
people down. We couldn't kick ev-
eryone out, because there wouldn’t
have been a school left. Iremember
a student who said it was wrong to
penalize people for drugs. He
thought people were watching him
and cats across the street were in fact
FBI agents or something. He was
seeing things that weren‘t there. I
told him he was paranoid.

I still believe myjob was not to
be apolicernan. Myjob was to work
wtth studean and help students work
their own problems out, I was sup
posed to report things I heard, but I
considered things students would tell
me to be gossip, and I refused to re-
peat gossip. I would only report ifI
had the facts. Ifstudents had a prob-
lem, I would get them to talk about
it. I listened,

S&B: Iheard a mrnor that the coir
lege Wouldn't ban smoking in the Po
rum until you left, and that seems to
be what they did.

Orin: You‘re klddingl Iwas ﬁght-
ing it before I left. Students needed
help on some issues. Smoking was
one of them. I got tired, A Commit
tee of students voted to ban smok-
ing, and I said no. I told them I‘d
vote yes when they discussed a place
smokers could go. I was voted down
and it went to Joint Board. I told
some students to show up and show
they cared, and many of them did.
We succeeded in delaying the issue.
It‘s too bad I can't smoke in North
Lounge and talk with students any-
more,

58:13: What in your career are you
most proud of?

Oda: One thing I was proud
of.,.when I started my job as Direc-
tor of Housing I had great difﬁculty
with the administration, especially
Facilities Management. I was per»
ceived as wanting to please students,

test. Iwanied the respect of the stu-
dents, so I respected them During
my years as oircctei or Hous _
vandalism dropped signiﬁcantly. It
was much lower than the aver to

ings, and when we’re not. wt: react

[The discussion shifts to drink-
mg]

Students get to know you by your
ofﬁce. When I was secretary to the
Dean of Men and would visit the
dorms, everybody thought I was
there to catch somebody. Why would
I care? I had to shut down lciityS
once, They had promised to stop
servmg beer at a certain point, and
the Dean of Students, who had guests
over at his house, called and as \d
me to shut thetn down. My Il-yeat'r
old wanted to go with me, but when
I pulled up to Darby, there wcie so
many drunks that she got scared and
stayed in the ear with the doors
locked. I ended up with beer all over
me, but I got it done

This probably isn‘t a good topic
while eating. but I remember when
someone peed all over the Younker
computer lab. Terriﬁc damage, a bad
smell, disgusting Ofcourse, we had
the dorm pay for it, and they threw
up such a fight. Someone started a
rumor that it would cost considerably
more than it actually
