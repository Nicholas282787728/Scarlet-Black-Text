Monmoul'l'i Game;
Splll Agains‘l Knox

By Garland DeNelsky

The Grinncll haseball squad
was downed by Monmouth Fri-
day, and then went on to split
a doubleheader with Knox.
Monmouth defeated the Pioneers
6-0. Knox handled the Pioneers
quite adequately in the ﬁrst
game. 16-4, but was swamped in
the second game 10.0 by Grim
nell’s baseball representatives.

Lee Moses, Grinneli hurler,
pitched. good ball against Mom
mouth, allowing only nine
hits. Grinncii batters collect-
ed eight hits against aee hurl»
er Dolilnger, but the differ-
ence was that the Pioneers
could not group their hits
while Monmouth did. Phil
Spelt led Grinnell's hitting
with two hits for three times
at the plate. Johnson led Mon.
month‘s attack with three for
four including a home run.
in the first game of the dou~
biehcader against Knox the Pro»
neers could do little. Twenty
Knox hits combined with nine
Grinnell errors prevented the
Pioneers f r o in accomplishing
anything in the seven-inning
contest. The playing field was
soaked with rain however, which
may have been in part respons-
ible for the wide open contest.
Armin Scharfe led Pioneer hit.
ting wlth three for four includ-
ing two doubles, while Lappa~
gard led Knox hitting with four
hits.

The picture was reversed
completelyinthe second game,
Dwight Nisscn limited Knox
to seven hits while Nissan’s
teammates collected 13. In ad.
dition'the Pioneers played er-
rorlcss hail, while Knox com-
mitted four miscues. Leading
Pioneer hitters were Gary
Pattsohuil with four for four,
Spelt with three for three.
