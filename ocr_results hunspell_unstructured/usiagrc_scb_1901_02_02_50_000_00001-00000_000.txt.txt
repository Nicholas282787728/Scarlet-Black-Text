Curios in Our Library.

Through the inﬂuence otvarious
agents. Iowa College has come inc
to possession otsome very old and
valuable articles, Valuable be
cause of their age and scarceness,
and in many cases, because otrlre'
memory of those who gave tllem
to the college.

One ot the most interestingcure
iosities is the Rand collection of
old books, about twenty-Five in
number. These were collected by
Elbridge D. Rand and upon his
death were given to the college
by Mrs. E. D. Rand. The oldest
of these is a book at two volumes
printed at Venice. Tile ﬁrstvol~
time, The Quintilian Declama-
tions, was printed in l480; the sec-
ond volume was printed in l4g3.
There is an edition of Cicero
printed in 1483, St. Augustine's
Epistles, 1493. and a translation
from the Greek into Latin by Eur
sebius in r493. Tlle edition at St.
Augustine’s epistlcs has handwork
initials, a feature of the printing of
that age.

There are two Geneva bibles,
one having been given to the cola
lege by Dr. Warren. This book
was given to him on condition that
upon his death he should give it
to some library tor careful preser»
vation. He gave it to Iowa Cola
lege because it had conierred on
him the degree of D, D. Tile
other Geneva bible belongs to the
Rand collection.

Among other interesting vol-
umes is a commentaly on the four
gospelsby Thomas Aquinas, print.
ed in Venice in r493. The covers
are board and it has a leather back.

 

There are also six volumes of
the works ot Luigi Canina on
“The Ediﬁces of Ancient Rome.”
These are said to have cost a hunl
di'ed dollars each, and are the gift
of Wendell Phlllips. The News
Lazar ot Nov, rr, lS‘o‘z. saysot this
gift, ”It will be one of the trca'-
tires of our restored library. It is
a work of greatest cost and rarity.‘
of which no other institution in
this part of the country is likely
to possess a copy,"

Among the various autographs
are those at the late Queen Victo-
ria, Garibaldi, U. S. Grant, Lincoln
and others. One is rather unique;
it was signed to a petition in ia-
vor oi the completion of Washing-
ton’s monument and reads tlius:
-Geo. G.Fogg, Independent Dem-
ocrat. ln favor of Washington!
but not the monument.”

There are many other curiosities
which space will not permit us to
mention. These curios tire of
great interest and their interest
will increase with time. It is ins
deed worth our while to give them
some attention.

Date Fixed for Home Concert.

March eighth has been decided
upon as the date [or the Home
Concert. The people of Grinnell
have come to expect great things
of the Glee Club and Orchestra,
and their highest expectations
have always been realized in the
annual appearance oi the two or-
ganizations. From present indi-
cations lhc concert this year will
be even better in some respects
than upon former occasions; both
organizations are doing iaithtul
and consistent work.

Interest in this event is, howev-
er, by no means entirely local.
There is always to be tound in the
audience a goodly number ot out-
of-town alumni and friends, and
it is for their beneﬁt particularly
that the announcement is made
at this time.

Pledges Must: be Made tor the
May Festival.

There is astrnngc apathy on
the part of the students in general
concerning the May Festival.
They do not seem to realize that

the scale proposed, they must

fortunately, tlre ﬁnancial side oilmv .s

such a venture must ﬁrst receive
consideration. The expense oi
such a testiial is too great to be
entrusted to the caprice oi the
public at the time of its produc-
tion, and whether or not the res
ceipts will cover the expenditures
must now be determined. Prof.
Cole does- not ask that the entire
amount be guaranteed by pledges
but only desires that a sufﬁcient
part is assured so that he rpay
ieel sate in completing the'ar-
rangements. Other schools have
these testivals and it would cer
tainly not appear well tor Grin-
nell to deprive herselt at such a
musical entertainment through
the indifference ot the students.
Not a student has been heard to
say he or she would not attend
the concerts were they to be given
now; but when the advisability of
their pledging for tickets for
future dates is mentioned, most of
them reply that they will wait till
time of the festival. This will
not do, Such an attitude will
result in the cancellation of the
dates.

Srudents’ Guide to the Men‘s
Gymnasium.

The above is the title of a book-
let just gotten out by Prof. Davis
tor the use and assistance of melt
students, desiring to better their
physical condition.

In brief, the book does this:
states the weak parts ot the hotly
(each individual being examined
by the director), prescribes pro
per exercises to overcome that
weakness. and, to, assist the slur
dent to get a clear perspective ot
his real condition, contains a
chart upon which his measures
merits may be plotted otit accord-
ing to the system of percentages.
By this chart. undeveloped musv
cles can be instantly located.
The remainder oilhc book sets
torth general rules ot hygiene.

The thoughtfulness of Prof.
Davis in getting oiit this bo
affords melcly another of the ex-
ccllcnt opportlllllties offered [or
physical improvement. Surely
tile ambitious student will avail
himself of it.
