should be made clear, however,

the collegc community of its own

the-input irom students, and to
project realistic alternatives which
aim at achieving these ends. At

 

such a time that any of these
recommendations might be put
into effect, an architectural iirm
would have to be called in to do the

actual design work.
In an interview. Mr. Ullberg

made it clear that each analysis is
“custom-tailored" to the in-
stitution being studied, The

Grinnell study has been divided
into eight basic phases, the first
tour oi which are underway this
week.

Tile ﬁrst of these points is a
physical plant inventory. being
carried out by B&G according to
guidelines established by Dober
and Associates, This consists of a
description of the physical con
dition and characteristics oi the
residential rooms in each hall.

Phase two is the presentation oi

Phase three is the above men-
tioned "cnvironmcnlal audit "
This includcs a detailed inventory
by a Dober licld learn of all the
“public" areas oi the dorms.
