graphy, 1761 e 1807 shouldbeavail-
able in bookstores withinatewdays.
The work is the iirst biography oi
Preble Written since 1847.

McKee told the StitB that active re-
search and writing ior the book
took place between 1960 and 1968.
His interest in the Massachussets-
born naval iigure beganwheri,work.
ing as a graduate student, McKee
discovered that despite the wealth
oi manuscript material available on
Prehle, no biography oI the man had
been Written in I25 years.

McKee’S main researchiorthe new
book took place in the Library or
Congress in Washington, but healso
traveled from Maine to South Cares
lina gathering material to round out
his work

During his work onthemanuscript,
McKee published an article in the
American Neptune, a iournal oi
maritime history, containing some
of the material which was later in-
cluded in his hook.

in studying Prcbie, McKee dis-
covered d great deal about the
overall naval history 01 lhe period.
"Studying the lite oi Prehle gave
me a good chance to study the naval
strategy oi the ,Jeiiolson presis
dency" . an area which McKee says
has been all but neglected by some

NUMBER Il

Four Put On
Probation

by an 5w siatt w rtter

Steven Snider, Clay Williams,
George Ebert, and Charles Erich-
iord were placed on conduct probas
tion by President Glenn Leggett
Wednesday, iollowing their convic—
tions last week by the All Campus
Judicial Council oi causing exceSA
sive noise during a campus distur-
bance last month. In addition, Leg-
gett iined Snider, Ebert, and Wills
iams $10.00 apiece ior thelrillegal
use of tire extinguishers. TtiePl-es-
ident’s action followed substantially
the Judicial Council’s recommenda-
tions, with the exception that he
placed the four on conductprobation
‘ ‘untii further notice," rather than
merely for the remainder of the
semester. as the Judicial Council
had recommended. 7

The length of the Probation may
vary, Leggett told the SdiB WedneSe
day, depending upon subsequent be
havior of the oiienders. “It may be
either longer or shorter than the
duration of the semester," he said.
Leggett has asked Dean oi Student
Aiiairs Conney Kimbo to observe
subsequent behavior at the tour and
to make periodic reports to him or
their actions.

In letters to each of the convicted
students Leggett also noted that any
further such incidents on the part OI
any of the tour would be grounds
{or their dismissal from the Cole
lege.

Snider, Williams, Ebert, and
Brichtord were not personally
involved, it appears, in the Clark
Hall incident of last week in which
a ﬁre alarm in the hall was pulled
during the night and red paint was
splattered on the doors at resi-
dents who had testiﬁed at the Judi-
cial Council hearing, although
residents do believe that an ele-
ment at retaliation was involved.
