is an invaluable record of early
innovations in color photography,
as well as a document of the
diversity and texture of pre-
revolutionary Russian society and
culture.

Prokudin-Gorsky. after his at-
tendance at the St. Petersburg
Technological institute in the late
1800s, worked in Berlin and Paris
to pioneer developments in color
photochemistry. There he devised
the unprecedented method of pho-
tographing a SubjL‘Ll three separate
times through color fillers corre-

Students Improvise with
Black Box Break Today

By Sarali Quimby

The Black Box Break concerts

in ignorance. the word “concert" is
perhaps misleading; Black Box
breaks are actually a form of cofr
fcchousc. an informal mix of per-
formances in an informal setting.
They have also been compared to
an open forum, where anyone can
perform without pressure,

Black Box breaks are so named
because they take place in a black
box theater, This is basically a
darkened rooin with minimal scene
cry, with the people and their pcrr
formtmces becoming the focus of
attention rather than elaborate sets

The organization mid style of

the Black Box mirrors this sparse,
informal “ethic” by keeping the
Show largely impropmtu. One
need not set up a time to perform,
or contact anyone for permission;
the show lasts as long as there are
people Willing togoon stage. In the
past, people have performed skits,
played instruments and even have
read children's books. Talent is not
required.

Originally the Black Box breaks
were run by the theater Educa-
tional Policy Committee. However,
due to the committee‘s current lack
ofinierest the Black Boxesare now
being run by other students this
year. The nextonc is today aims
in the Arena Theater, and it Should
provide a relaxing study break.

Zeppelin’s
Music Lives
in Boxed
Compilation

America will never escape Led
Zeppelin‘s shadow. People still
listen to their music. Most of
Grinnell's students were at least lo
or 11 when Jimmy Page. Robert
Plant and John Paul Jones had the
grace to ground the Zeppeiin after
John Bonham's death. But once
again the Zeppelin lumbers aloft,
launching another hard rock assault
onAmei-iea,thistimewithitsnewest
release, a retrospective.

“White Summer" is Page's
Indian-tuned guitar masterpiece
from his Yardbirds days and was
broadcast live on the BBC in 1969.
Zcppelin's version of Robert
Johnson’s blues, “Travelling
Riverside Blues," was also
broadcast live over tthBCin 1970.

As Plantput it, “Led Zeppelin's
music is timeless, and it's time for
a million mile checkup.“

Ten years ago this month, Led
Zeppelin displaced the almighty
Beatles in aMelodyMakerreaders’
poll of their favorite bands. From
that time until today, Plant’s sirenr
waits and Page‘s thousand-note
llurrics have fallen down like hail
on America. The new box set is so
clear that you can hear what Jones
is rnurmuring in the studio before
“Black Country Woman."

“Kashmir,” the consummate
Led Zeppelin song. sounds clearer
than ever. and one can easily
imagine the journey through
Morocco on that one lone road.

PageandPlantgrewuplistening
to Johnson, the most influential
bluesman oIthe 19205. Peoplesaid
that Johnson must have waited by
the moonlight on a Mississippi
crossroad for Satan to tune his
guitar. and the same was often said
of the Zep. But it is now evident
that Led Zeppelin is not devil's
music, it has withstood the test of

both in terms of music and
pcrtorinancc.

The core or Zeppelin
masterpieces contained on this set
establishes Led Zeppelin as a band
for all times. Kurt Loder put it
aptly. Many groups gnaw at the
body of Zcppclin's sound and
attitude. and they occasionally bite
offa tasty piece. But the heart, the
essence of Led Zeppelin. escapes
them utterly.

The set also comes with a
booklet, containing eight pages of
photos, and essays by Cameron
Crowe, Loder and Palmer. For the
approximately 340-560 cost or the
album, it is a Zen fan's must, as
good as any bootleg you will find,
As Plant sings on “Ten Years
Gone:"“Changesﬁllmytime,baby
that’sallrightwrthme/Indiemidst
