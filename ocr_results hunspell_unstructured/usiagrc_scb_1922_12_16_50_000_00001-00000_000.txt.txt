bring about a settlement of the Car-

A discussion of plans of procedure

Situation Delicate.

The extreme delicacy of the sltua<
ition is apparaht when one re'mennhers
that some 1,200 troups are still quar-
Itered in the Rhine district. Should
hostilities break out between France
and Germany and the American troops
on the Rhine should be attacked, the
United States would be compelled to
reinforce them or swallow the at-
front, and in that manner would be
likely to be drawn into the conflict
(in the other hand these troops are
there at the specific request of Car.

Germany.

maneuvering to bring the United
