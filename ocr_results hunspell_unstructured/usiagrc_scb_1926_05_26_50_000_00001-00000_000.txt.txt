ncers won every set of the dual.

Captain Nicolai, playing number one
position. decisively downed nierctt oi
the Bulldogs in straight sets, n-z', 673.
Though the Pioneer net inan iron
handily, the liidtch w s not devoid of
thrills and some sparkling tennis was
displayed by both men. ett did
not appear to be in his best form and
lost many points by frequent netting,

Sunble Wills Easily

struhle. ranking nninber two, easily
defeated Herriott of Drake in straight
sets. Struble was not forced to extend
himself against the Drake man and his
powerful back court drives and excel-
lent placements kept his opponent
balfle‘d.

Stotts and Patrick, were on almost
equal terms, their match going three
sets before stotts emerged winner. In
the first set Patrick was apparently
of: his game for he netted frequently
and the Pioneer not star won handily,
6-1. The second set found both men
,battling on even terms and only
through some clever tennis was Pat-
rick able to pull through with a 977
victory, in the final set Stotts clearly
outplayed the Blue and White man
and won 7.5.

Hurley Battles Lovejoy

Lovejoy, Grinnell's fourth man, had
a drawn out battle with Harley of
Drake. In the first set, Lovejoy took
the lead and through superior playing
came through with a 6-3 win. Iirthe
second set Harley began to open up
and forced the match to a 12-10 de-
cision.

In the doubles matches Nicolet and
Struble outclassed Everett and Her-
riirtt, winning 775, 63 while Smiley
paired with Stotts downed Patrick and
and Harley 7-5. 3-3. Yesterday's mat.
ches increased the Grinnell racket—
men’s list of victories (dual meets) to
eighteen consecutive wins.

Grinnell's only other entries were

Laird in the javelin, and Woodruff in
the two mile. Laird won third Place
in the javeliu toss with a mark of 178
ft. 10 inches, and the relay team fin-
ished fifth, running a good race all
the way, being clocked in 1: 1. Wood—
l'uff placed fourth in the two mile run.

Nebraska romped off with the meet,
scoring 50 1-10 points. a safe margin
over Missouri who came next with 35
1-10 points. Locke, Nebraska's speed
demon, smashed another world's rec-
ord, when he galloped the furious in
:20.7 seconds. This is the secondtime
that Locke has broken this record, but
his previous record was not allowed by
the records committee of the A. A. A.
In the century Locke also equaled the
world mark for the event iunning the
distance in :9.6 sec. The crowning
achievement of the Husker speed boy
was the great race he ran as anchor
man on the Nebraska half mile relay
team. In this race the third Husker
relay man gave Locke a bad handicap,
but the new “fastest human" was
twenty yards to the good when he cut
the tape.

Conger of Ames won the one mile
and half mile runs in very good time.
The two mile went to Rutherford of
Oklahoma. In this race Woodrnif was
in the running (or first place all the

and had to accept fourth.

One of the best races of the day was
in the high hurdles when Simpson at
Drake ran neck and neck with Weir
for the full flight, with the Husker
star crowding the Drake runner out
at the tape. In the low hurdles, Taiy-
lor, an unknown Oklahoma man, up—
