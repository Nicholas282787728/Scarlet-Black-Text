The Giinnell College men’s bas-
kctball team used the thi'ee»bal.l, their
usual pressure defense and inspired play
this past week to push their record to
571(270 MWC).

After an early non-conference game . ,
against an over-matched Mount Mercy
team, the conference season opened for
the Pioneers on Dec. 2.

The men’s basketball team faced
offagainst two tough conference rivals,
Beloit and Ripon, last Friday and Sat
iirday at the Darby gym.

Grinnell suﬁ’ered losses to both of
these teams a year ago, so the Pioneers
picking up this pair of wins reﬂects the
importance of changes on the couit this
season.

“it’s still too early to make det
finitive statements, but the best thing.
about our group right now is the team
chemistry" said Head Coach Dave Arr
seneault. “Our captains are much more
laid back than last year's trio and the .
underlings have responded to this type
ofieadershipThcrc really aren't any big
egos on the team and,for the most part,
the guys just seem more relaxed. This,
plus playing at home, has auowed us to
shoot the ball better than we did a year
ago.”

Grinnell hit 28 three-pointers
against Mount Mercy last Tuesday en
route to a 1407120 victory. After com-
piling a double-digit first-half lead, the
Pioneers continued their onslaught, ext
hausting the Mount Mercy defenders.

John Grotberg ’09 led all scorers
with 31 points and Trek Laugenhan '07
had 26 points and was 8712 shooting
from behind the arc. After the victory,
the team had just a few days to prepare
for their first conference action of the
year

The Pioneers Came out firing
against the Buccaneers, posting 61
points in the first half. and taking a 13*
point lead into halftime.

Their play only improved as they
pushed and pressured the ball for the
remainder of the game.

Grotberg led the scoring once again
with 26 points and David Arseneault
’09 had 15 points to go with nine assists
en the way to a 133405 victory. ‘

The Ripon contest was a bit more
competitive and the lead see-sawed for
much of the game. In the end, it was a
1343 run in the last 2:36 minutes that

On Dec, 2 and 3, the swimming
and diving teams competed against D11
schools as well as Bill schools at the
Mutual nmeaha Invite.

Despite the extremely tough com,
petition, Nate Witnam ’09 was confi-
dent waiting on the blocks for his race
to begin, “You have to give yourselfthe
option [of winningl," he said. “If you
visualize failure, you’ll Come to it."

Witnam followed his own advice,
beating the competition and winning
the 200 fly by a narrow margin with a
time of2:00.88 minutes.

The race was one of many that took
place last weekend at the Mutual Ins
vitational hosted by the University of
NebraskasOmahn.

Grinnell more than stepped up to
the challenging competition, giving
a strong performance that left Coach
Erin Hurley confident in the teams’
ability to maintain stamina and speed
over future two day meets.

“When we can race with [Division

2 and 3 schools] and that’s pretty excitr
ing,"she said.

The Mutual omeaha Invite repre-
scritcd the best competition the teams
have seen thus far, and Hurley believes
it will be the best the Grinnell diving
teams will see until Nationals.

A total of 10 women's teams and
eight men’s teams
competed against
Grinnell. The DH
schools participating
in the meet relieved
some of the pressure
on Grinnell to come
in first place.

Because the
teams did not or
peet to win, Hurley found it easier to
focus on individual performances, like

Among the men, co-caprain Dan
Shryock '06 won the onesmetcr dive
both days of competition and comp
tain Pete Biown '06 came in third in
the 100 freestyle.

These performances led to a sixth

place finish for both
the men’s and wom—
en‘s teams.

"The goal for the
meet was to swim
the fastest we've
swam this season,”
said Hurley. And
indeed, with 49 seat
son best times for the men and 59 seat
son best times for the women, the team
achieved its goals.

Hurley was further encouraged by
the team‘s inipioved endurance demr
onstrated over the course of two days.
“There were a lot [of swimmers] who
eould've kept going," she said.

But according to COsCitptain Sarah
Stayer 'oo, Witnam’s victory in the 200
ﬂy was the most exciting race of the
meet.

“I knew he was fast before, but not
that fast," said Staycr.

Although Witnam’s strategy of
sprinting through all 200 meters made
for an exciting race, it left Hurley sees
ing areas for improvement.

Hurley sees this sprint as evidence
that the team is still early in its season,
compared to many of its competitors
from other conferences, who have been
in training foi up to four weeks longer.

“I can't say I'm happy with how he
did it," said Hurley “Once he makes
adjustments, he'll swim even faster.”

The racc demonstratcd the tcani’s
strengths as well as their weaknesses,

Despite the risky strategy ofsprintt
ing through the entire race, Witnam
felt that the cheers from the team gave
him the energy to continue,

“Once you get that support, your
endurance just increases so much.”
