As cm expression, as a sport

by Margo Calvctti

This year the Grinnell swim
teams, the most successful sports
teams so far, are sending members

to National competition. Out of the
six women and eight men, two are

divers, Norm Zimmerman and
Renee Reichart.

The diving competition is an
integral part of the swimming
competition. in an interview with
both Norm ,and Renee, we
discussed diving not only as a
sport, but as Renee said, ”An
expression of our ability.” In
asking Norm, “Why diving?” he
replied. “Why anything? It in-
trigues me to be able to develop a
part of myself that I think is there
and don't Want to waste."

Diving is a mental discipline, As
Norm said. “It is a sport of
precision and accuracy Every
little movement is noticed. As a
result it can get tedious." During
practice Renee said, “It is a lonely
thing to do." They both agreed
that in competition positive
reinforcement can come from the
reaction of the spectators. Norm
said. “It gives me a personal
satisfaction to express myseli and

‘. have someone there to receive it.”

on the subject of competition,
both Norm and Renee feel that
their major concern is not whether
they win or lose. in a separate
interview with Norm. he said, “l'm

not out to beat my opponent. i
enjoy the competition with myself,
therefore I don’t fear it. oftentimes
people compete for the wrong
reasons.” He feels that confidence
comes from feeling like you are
worth something, not only ‘ to
others, but to yourself as well. He
commented that a false sense of
confidence can develop when a
diver beats his- her opponent and
loses sight of his her own self
improvement

Norm is a good diver and he
knows it. Last weekend at the
Men’s Conference meet he took two
first places. “But," he said. (‘1
didn't do well. I did mediocre. lfl
am going to do well at Nationals, i
will have to do better." For Norm
it is the process, not the place,
which will determine the outcome.

Right now the women are at the
Nationals in Clarion. Pa. Renee
isn‘tsurehowshew' favoramong
the others, but is excited about the
chance to compete with national
competition. For Norm, Nationals
on March 14. in Oberlin, Ohio, is
"just another meet.” He is op-
timistic about the competition,
because he is (In unknown and the
iudges are less likely to be biased. ’
He said. ”Because Grinnell

 

competes in division Ill, not
everyone takes being “Top Dog” as
seriously time were in Division 1.”
