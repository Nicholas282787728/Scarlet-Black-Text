cess, including a 1996 league title
and national playoff berth. On the
way the cagers grabbed four
NCAA scoring and threerpoint
shooting titles.

“Our system has not changed
a great deal, but each year it
seems like we're using more and
more players in our shift rota»
tion." noted Atseneault. The

choose his three groups of five
from this season.

solid in an invitational and big meet
like the ones we have later in the sear
son,”

“Since we have so many
people contributing to our success
it is hard for me to note them all.
The great thing about our team
this season is balance. We have

head coach to facilitate recruiting
and complete his 50’” year of ser-
vice to the college.

“Of course we are saddened by
John's announcement. but he feels
it is time to step aside to let some-
one elsc guide the program. Coach
Pfitsch did an outstanding job of
building our soccer program and

I'm sure Grinnell soccer has a
bright future and for that we thank
John Pfitsch." concluded Fairchild.

The Grinnell College men’s and
women’s cross country teams con-
cluded their seasons at the NCAA
Division III regional meet hosted by
St. Olaf in Northfield, Minnesota
last Saturday. The women ran well:
however the men‘s team ended on a
disappointing note.

The women trekkers placed 15"I
out of 25 teams, “Our conference
showing was a big disappointment,
but we ended on a positive note With
everyone competing well at
regionals,” said Coach Evelyn Free—
man. ‘

Snow and freezing temperatures
were a factor. but the Pioneers pre-
pared themselves mentally fer the
weather during last week‘s prac-
tices.

Nebraska Wesleyan won the meet
with just 71 points and St. Olaf
nipped College of St. Benedict for
second. 103-102. St, Thomas,
which was ranked first in the coun-
try, failed to make it out of the re-
gion as it lost the battle for fourth
to Loras. 110-112.

Senior Becca Webel’, the team
leader throughout the season, placed
55'" with a time of 20:55 Chava
Goldstein (21:50) edged Geny
Riester (21:51) for the 105‘" spot.
and senior Sarah Liegl (21:53) fin»
ishcdjust behind for the 109‘” place.
“It was a large field, and everyone
ran competitively, but Chava ran her
best race of the season." commented
Freeman.

“We had a very large group of .
women who participated this past
season, but we were a young team.
This bodes well for the future," con-
cluded Freemanr -'

The men placed 11‘“ in the 23-
team field at the NCAA Division III
regional meet. St. Johns won the
meet with 72 points. while Nebraska
Wesleyan and St. Thomas tied with
77 points. L'oras was next with 99.

“The whole meet flabbergasts me
because I reit we were physically
and mentally prepared to race. The
top three teams should do well at
regionals. which would increase the
representation from our region to
four," exclaimed Coach Will Free-
man.
iAlthough Grinnell failed to
qualify for nationals, there is hope
for the future since there were no
seniors in the scoring five. Fresh-
men John Aerni (27:44)'and Rob
Park (27:57) led the way as they
placed 37‘h and 51“ while sopho-
mores Dan Madigan (28:01) and
Casey Miller (28:46) captured the
55-h and 84‘" spots.

“We thought we had a shot at fin-
ishing in the top six, The weather
could have been a factor. but we
are a young team with runners who
will only improve," commented
Freeman.
