The Walker proposal to alter the
faculty evaluation process has met
with a number of changes since im

uations, instead of establishing an

Executive Council inte rviewing team
which would compile a critique of
professors every third and sixth
year.

Immediately after receiving acopy
of the proposal, the SGA cabinet,
acting on their own initiative and
in an advisory capacity, met with
Walker. At that time they recom-
mended that students from the de—
partmental SEPC’S work together
with faculty members of the EX»
ecutive Council interviewing te-
ams; the amundment which was ac-
ceptcd.

In response to student dissatislac-
tion with the original proposal, Wal-
ker released another memo May 15.
In it, he stressed that compmhen»

. sive evaluations could be requested
at any time, including the first
contract period. “If any one of these
four agencies (SEPC, department,
division chairman, or dean) reques-
ted a thorough evaluation, that pro-
cedure would be put into effect.”

Student Coordinator Lynne Nuber
emphasized that, “It’s indicative of

C the minimal student role in the de-
cision-making process at Grinnell
when a proposal like this can con-

fe rs, will be attending Grinnell next
year.

Applications to Grinnell we re down
33% in January, and liberalproject-
ions are for fewer students in the
coming year. Ryandeclaresthat“we
are now in good shape," and attri-
butes the lower number of new stu-
dents to a trend in slower applica-
tions on behalf of prospectives.

Downward Trend

Dean of the College Waldo Walker
presents six general reasons for this
downward trend. First, the energy
crisis may make a school which is
closer to one’s home more desire-
able. Second, the substantial cost
of a private college ’5 tuition, room,
and board is prohibitive for many
students ineligible for financial aid.

A stabilizing birth rate across the
nation may create a smaller pool of
college age individuals. Fourth, the
abolishment of a compulsory draft
allows those men, who might nor—
mally attend college in order to
avoid the dralt, to work if they so
choose. Another reason is an ap-
parent nationwide disenchantment
With ‘the concept of a liberal arts
education.

Finally, the number of applications
has decreased in lvy League and
other prestigious institutions, con-
seque ntly reducing the available pool
of students who would normally apply
to Grinnell.

The school’s academic standards
remain the same, but the sheer
volume of applicants has decreased
In respect to Grinnell’s academic
standards, there has been no signi-
ficant change in the raw board sc-
ores of students who have paid de-

ceivably be implemented withoutthe
Student body ever being advised."
Walker also stressed that he did
not want to take advantage of the
end of the semester to “muscle
this proposal through.” If time runs
short this semester, consideration
could be extended until Oct. 1. Wal-
ker hopes to have the proposal
approved by the faculty this spring
to eliminate any barriers for dis—
cussion by the new curriculum com-
mittee next fall.

posits tor the fall term.
Paid Deposits

As of May 6, the number of paid
deposits received by Grinnell put the
college in third place on the roster
of ACM schools. Although this per-
centage is 7% lower than it was at
this time last year, the situation
has radically improved since Jan-
uary.

One positive consequence ofthe re-
duction in ove rall studentenrollme nt
will be an increase in the faculty/
student ratio. Presently, Grinnell’s
ratio of 11.711 is the lowest of all
ACM colleges, The predicted ratio
for the 1974-75 academic year is
11. 1.

Bolt Zups Campus
lights, Trees

by Kyle Schaub

Violent May skies released a tree
mendous display of electrical pow-
er last Sunday nightduringthe state-
wide storm which produced heavy
hail and four tornados in the Cen-
tral Iowa region. Although no torn-
ados were sighted in Grinnell, sev-
eral bolts struck trees and other
tall structures.

\According to Dale Hawn, Direc-
tor of the Physical Plant, the cam-
pus electricity was wiped out for
half an hour when lightening struck
the main transformer switch on Ten-
th Avenue, blowing several high vol~
tage fuses.

Blackout
Hawn explained that the actual
rep ir work on the transformer
swi on was not difficult, but that
the Iowa Southern Utility had a
temporary manpower shortage to
the complete town blackout. He ad-
ded, "ISU responded as soonas thev
could get to us, and changed over to
our alternate source ofsupply,"The
time required for the repair took
an estimated 10-20 minutes.
Study Break

Students took the opportunity to
indulge in unscheduled study hr-
eaks, while daring rescues were
carried out in the dark at the sw-
imming pool and other campus lo-
cations. Dn the lighter side sev-
eral library fans dodged the bolts
and the raindrops to celebrate the
blackout down in the candle-lit pub
over a few beers.

SGA Buns,

by Laura Miller

In a meeting characterized by a
noticeable lack of heated argument
and a general atmosphere of resig~
nation to the situation confronting
SGA, Joint Boards voted in a close
decision to ban all dogs from cam-
pus for the 1974-75 school year.
Cats will be allowed to remain, ob-
stensibly because they constitute
less of a problem.

Debate opened with the possibili-
ties and problems involved in en-
forcement of the present leash law,
which Dean of Student Alfairs Jim
Tederman explained "is incredibly
expensive." The newly elected hall
representatives reached a concen-
sus that either stricter guidelines
or some ultimate recourse was ne~

Misplaced Steaks Complicate

A broken window in the Quad dining
hall door started the whole incident
last Saturday night. Two people,
David Chalkley and Carol Godsch-
all, spotted the obvious gap and tel»
cphoned BirG. '

While they waited for the watch-
man to arrive, anotherstudent, Dave
TenEyck, arrivedandallthree began
discussing the possibility ota break-
in, While TenEyck and Chalkley
went outside to check for any in-
side activity, Godschall telephoned
the campus operator to contact the
police.

The operator told her thatGodsch-
all would have to call herself. God-
schall then telephoned Saga Food
Director Jerry Ramaker and the
police according to school policy.

Ramaker then telephoned Saga ma-
nager’ Dave McConnell and later

Ralph Pomerenk, Director of Col-
lege Services, who then called Jim
Tederman. Dean of Student Affairs.
in the meantime, Tenliyck and Ch-
alkley, returned, and reported that
they had seen MarkNissenandMark
Hipp leaving Quad with a crowbar
in hand.

After Ramaker and the police ar-
rlved at Quad, the kitchen was hur-
ridly inspected for theft and dam
age. rehEyck, the Saga worker in
charge of storingtlle surplussteaks,
noticed that they were not where he
had put them earlier in the evening.
It was then decided that 60 steaks
had been stolen from Quad, and the
police set out to find Nissen and
Hipp.

Nissen and Hipp were arrested at
a Cowles Dcrtv and taken downtown

ce'ssary to deal with the numerous
complaints received against dogs.
However, lengthy discussion failed
to provide a workable solution.

"Pressure on the college from
both the campus and local commun»
ity is building in terms of demands
to do something to control dogs
on campus,” stated Dean Waldo
Walker. following a student motion
to ban dogs. Complaints of lawns
torn up, preschoolers harrassed,
and garbage trashed were citedas
law rationale for this move. Th—
ough institution of the leash law
temporarily reduced the number of l
complaints, this was not viewed as
a long-run answer because of the
restricted existence dogs wouldbe ,
forced to live.

Few pet owners attended theSunday
meeting of Joint Boards in South
Lounge despite substantial advance
publicity from the Scarlet and El-
ack, KDIC, and the Student Coor-
dinator’s Offioe. SGA President .Io-
hn Hansen summarized the situation
when he stated, "the problem K
see with the whole issue is that
we’ve moved into an area where
students are set against students
and the campus is divided."

The vote to ban dogs, and conse-
quently to disregard the results of
a student referendum taken earlier,
was defended by Vice ~President P6-
to Reiner. ”It’s anirresponsible act
to say that students want pets, so
let’s have them and fuck everyone
else," he declared.

Ice Theft

for questionino. The two suspects
denied stealing the steaks orbreak-
ing the window. but did admit to
entering Quad by raisinganunlocked l
window with a crowbar to steal ice
for the Cowles party. Detective Ah-
rens then released the two, and did
not press charges,

The missing steaks were found
the next morning in an adjacent
freezer, although no one knows who
broke the window.

Tederman said that Nissen and
Hlpp suggested paying fines rattler
than undergo judicial council pro-
ceedings and possible felony char-
ges. As a result, Nissen is on con—
duct probation {or one year, and
Hipp will pay the College $50 in
fines, since he is leaving for Col-
umbia University next fall.
