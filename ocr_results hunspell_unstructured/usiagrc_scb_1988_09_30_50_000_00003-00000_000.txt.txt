ISO party aims to dissolve
xenophobia among students

by John Newmark

It was 10:15 Saturday night
and I was in Gardner Lounge
dancing to some music. Nothing
very unusal about that. A person
dancing nearby asked me very
politely, "I don't want to sound
rude. but may I pop your bal-
loon?" That is not a question one
would expect to hear at the usual
Grinnell party. However, since
there was a yellow balloon at-
tached to my left leg. the ques-
tion made perfect sense. Why
was I wearing a yellow balloon?
I'll answer that later, first let me
give you a little background.

This was the International
Student Organization (ISO) zin-
nual allrcampus party. It is de-
signed to combat xenophobia, the
fear of foreign cultures, by
exposing students to a variety of
such cultures. It was held Satur—
day, September 24, from 9:30
pm. to I aim. As I entered
Gardner at 9:30, I had some idea
about what to expect. I had been
told that the refreshments would
be international, as would the
music. I had also been told to
expect to see ISO members
wearing traditional clothes from
their native countries. Finally, I
had been told that we would be
taught some new dances. While I
was intrigued by the idea, I feared
there would be a low \umout, es—
pecially when I discovered ISO
had decided not to serve alcohol.
I am glad to say that I was
proven wrong.

At 9:30 Gardner wasn't
crowded. and I thought my fears
were being confirmed. but by 10
pmr the room was full. The
refreshments were good, but a
fruit punch they served was
excellent. I ended up coming
back for seconds, and thirds, and
fourths. But while the refresh-
ments were great, I couldn't re-
main there, because the music
was pulling me towards the dance
floor. I danced until about 10:15
when the music stopped and an
announcement was made. We
were to play a game where
everybody would blow up a bal-
loon and attach it to one of their
ankles with a rubberband. Then
the music would start, and we
would dance, until there was a
sudden stop in the music. Then
we were supposed to pop as
many balloons as we could before
the music started again. This is
whereI was approached and asked
by someone if they could “pop
my balloon." I naturally re-
sponded, "You can try" The
game was fun, and was a good
start to the evening's activities.

The music continued after all
the balloons were popped and for
about 45 minutes everybody
conversed, danced, or a combina-
tion of both After the 45 min-
utes were over another an—
nouncement was made. Everyone
who wanted to learn a Central
American dance called the Salsa
was supposed to form a circle.
We were given a basic

demonstration of what the Salsa
was supposed to look like, and

party which was held last Saturday night,

we all tried to imitate it. with
differing amounts of success.
Only one more event was
scheduled for that night. but it
was a case of the best being saved
for last. Around 11:30 I saw a
congo line go by me, so I
quickly joined in. The room was
so crowded it was hard to see ev-
erything that was going on, so 1
was surprised to find out what
was at the end of the conga line.
At one end of the room, two
people were holding up a long
wooden bar while dancers were
bending over backwards trying to
go underneath. The dance, while
it originated outside the United
States, has found its way here and
has become quite wellrknown. It
is called the limbo, and it is a lot
harder than it looks. The bar was
lowered once everybody had gone
through once, and I, along with a
lot of other people, backed off to
the sidelines to watch in awe
some students who I swear must
have backs made out of cartilage.
The limbo bar was taken out

one more time during the night,
and I decided to stand on the side—
lines the full time and figure out
how it was done. I think I did
discover the secret. It is not that
some people have backs made out
of canilage, but that some people
are born with more than one joint
in the legs. I, unfortunately, was
born with just my knees, so it is
impossible for me to do as well
as everyone else That made me
feel a lot better.

The party was a big success;
apparently more people showed
up this year than did last year.
As I was helping to clean up after
the party was over, I saw people
removing from the south wall a
huge sign that read,
"Xenophobia." The symbolism
contained in the removal of the
sign was obvious. People from a
variety of cultures and national
backgrounds were there-- Bangali,
Chinese, Indians, Costa Ricans,
Germans, Australians. and

Americans. While xenophobia
and other prejudices might be
deeply bred into many of us, that
party succeeded in removing a
little bit of it in the people who
attended. Nothing big, peace
didn't break out all over the globe
at the end of the party, but every
little bit helps.

A cure for brain fatigue

"FOOD IS WORKING"
flashes across the computer
screen of the person next to you
in your dorm teriminal room.
"What kind of paper is he
writing?“ you ask yourself. Your
neighbor isn't writing a paper.
they're using the computer
'Quoteboards‘, which have
become a popular study break for
Grinnell students The menu
allows you to choose whether
you want to read the

idea, joke, Monty Python Quote.
poem, pun, Professor Quote,
thought, word or menu of the day
or participate in one of two
ongoing discussions.

Each board is controlled by a
separate student. Anyone who
knows the program can use the
boards. most of which were set
up last spring. The system is
run entirely by the students.
Chen, who runs the Idea of the
Day, as well as a program that
serves as a ”nexus" to all the rest,
says he started it because, "I
think it‘s neat. It’s pretty
interesting and meaningful and
entertaining. Sometimes people
have nothing else to do."

The discussion topics range
from Christianity and social
treatment of homosexuals to
movies, politics and comic
strips. Users don't have to use
their real names, either. “Most
people use pseudonymsand

continue to use the same
pseudonym," said frequent
participant Eva-Lise Carlstrom.

Nadia Abdel-Wahab first got
the idea to start the Professor
Quote of the Day last spring in
Mr. Hawthorne's Political
Science class. Professor
Hawthorne said something so
funny (Nadia can't remember
what it was any more) that she
began collecting quotes from all
her professors. "It was originally
intended as a Fact of the Day but
I decided to start Prof, Quote of
the Day instead." Students from
around campus heard of her idea
and sent in quotes even before the
board was fully operational.
Does Nadia have a favorite quote?
Mr. Hielala, history professor.
once said, "Chances are, if your
parents didn't have kids, you
won't either," "Every time I read
[the quotes] they're new to me,"
Nadia said "They all show the
sense of humor our profs have."
Nadia stressed that, I‘Thc board is
not meant to poke‘ fun at the
profs but to Show that they
have a sense of humor."

So next time you experience
brain fatigue when you're
entering a paper into the
computer, why not take a break
and look at the Quotcboards‘.7
