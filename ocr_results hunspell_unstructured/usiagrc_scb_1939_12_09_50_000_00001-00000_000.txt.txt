Norton Reviews
Background of

Finnish War

Robert H. Norton, instructor in
history, Wednesday evening dis-
cussed the causes leading up to
the Russian innish conflict be-
fore a meeting of the Congrega—
tional Men’s club.

Describing the background of
the war, Norton pointed to the
centuries of subservience or the
Finns, first to Sweden and later
to Russia.

In 1917, taking advantage of
the Russian r volution, the gap
idly rising spi t of Finnish na-
tionalism culm ated in s proclar
mation of independence, later hec-
ognizcd by Russia.

The Finnish republic, then Cree
eted, was dominated by the
“whites," who, after hitter civil
strife, defeated and massacred
the “red" faction.

Dwelling on the more immedi
ate causes of the present conflict,
Norton pointed to both the appre~
heusion felt by the Sovl legime
at the distance of only 22 miles
separating their capital, Lenin-
grad, and the Finish border, and
to the desire of Russia to gain
control of the Gulf of Finland
and the northern Baltic through
seizure of the strategic, Finnish-
owned, Aaland islands.

C. A. Smith, Harvard Business School Dean, Advises

Students to Take 0

“Be sure to get as much of a lib-
eral education as possible in your
undergraduate years," was the
advice of George A‘. Smith, as-
sistant dean of the School of
Business Administration at Har-
vard University in a talk before
the vocations meeting yesterday.

Smith advised undergraduate
students who plan taking grad-
uate work to go directly from colr
lege into graduate study, pointing
out that once the student leaves
his studies it is not only prob—
able that he will never rcturn to
them, but also that in the event
that he does, his studying techs
nique will have become iusty.

Explaining the difference be—
tween study in college and grad—
uate school, Smith declared that
in the latter case the student has
to learn to draw out his own in—
formation, while in the former the

 

professors more or less thrust the

information upon the student.

In deciding Whether to take
graduate work, Smith advised the
student to gather his facts con-
cerning his own characteristics,
interests, and financial, position;
thoroughly analyze the field he

plans to outer; and then make his-

is desirable. "This choice," said
Smith, "is one that no other per-
son can make for you.”

Smith cautioned against decid-
ing upon a particular field with-
out thorough study of its charac-
teristics. In many fields, the De»
cessary personality characteristics

students not to overlook the non
white-collar positions in industry
today. The individual must de-
cide whether he wishes to work
with his hands or his head or both.
1n doing this, one must not attach
a “phoney” dignity to the white
collar job.

“Many people have the illusion
that there are only two possibili—
tics in white collar work, a job
asabig executive at the very top,
or a complete failure. They seem
to lose sight of the fact that it
is between these two extremes
that most positions are likely to

“Judgment, decisivcncss, and
willingness to shoulder responsibil-

do not have these qualifications,
and would, therefore, be happier
and more successful at routine
work."

Thel'a Sigma
To Conﬁnue

Coed Journalists
Obtain Alumnae Aid
In Financing Chapter

Theta sigma Phi, women‘s nat-
ional honorary and professional
journalistic society, will continue
to have a chapter on the Grinnell
campus in spite of financial and
membership difficulties, according
to Elizabeth Van Wagenen, presi—
dent of the organization. -

The decision was reached, Miss
Van Wagenen said, after a cam
vass of the alumnae of the group
was made asking for permission
either to di hand the chapter or
for finencal assistance for the
coming year.

The Gl‘inuell chapter of the na—
tional society is the smallest on
any campus in the country and is
faced with a continued small
membership because only second
semester Juniors and seniors are
eligible to join the group, Miss
Van Wogencn pointed out.

The alumnae have plcdged fi-
nancial support for the chapter
this year, and the chapter, with
the help of the Press club, will
raise the remainder of the funds.
