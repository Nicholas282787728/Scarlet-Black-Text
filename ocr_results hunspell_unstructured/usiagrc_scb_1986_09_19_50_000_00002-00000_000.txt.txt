S. African Freshmen

Speak

by Kristina Scott

For three Grinnell freshmen, living in a
racially mixed environment comes as a
refreshing novelty. George Leburu,
Patrick Masobe, and a third student who
prefers to remain anonymous have just
recently come-to the United States irom
South Airica. All three are soft-spoken.
Yet the tones of their voices do not deprive
their words of impact, for the stories they
have to tell are oi censorship, arbitrary
police power. and state propaganda

“What you read in American
newspapers is just the tip of the iceberg oi
what is happening in South Africa," ex-
plains Lehuru.

Since the imposition of the latest state of
emergency on June it oi this year have
been severe restrictions imposed there
upon foreign journalists They cannot
report on statements deemed
“subversive" or “endangering the public
safety,” nor are they to be within Sight of
an arrest, a restricted gathering, or a
police action‘,

The police have been granted unlimited
power and legal immunity Any statement
or conduct a policeman deems as “subver-
Sive” is grounds for arrest, "Subversive"
can include anything irom wearing an “inn
appropriate” Tshirt insignia to taking plea
tures at a township festival

“And they never arrest you without
beating you up first," notes the student
who prefers not to be identified.

“The state oi emergency has not changr
ed anything, it has only legalized the brute
force of the police," remarks Mosabe.
Even before mass funerals had been bann-
ed under the state of emergency, police
fired tear gas into a peaceful crowd of
several thousand at such a gathering.
When the mourners would not disperse,
the police opened iirc, killing a young stu-
dent,

' The black educational system is
characterized by inferior quality and tern

says the South African government sub»

are spent on a black child. Children caught

Whereas the South African Ambassador
to the United States, Herbert Beukes, told
the Christian Science Monitor on
September 5, that “huge majorities of
blacks don't want sanctions,” all three
students interviewed disagreed.

“The vast majority of balck South
Africans are for economic sanctions
against the apartheid regime,” states
Leburu. “Any statement to the contrarv is

either propaganda or a lie."

Some uneducated blacks, however,

ing that iithey support sanctions, they Will
lose their jobs, do fear the imposition oi
sanctions “Someone needs to tell them
what the main idea behind sanctions is,"
insists the third student interviewed
Others, while in lavor of sanctions. will not
voice their opinion Supporting sanctions is
subversive and is punishable.

“In South Africa, the U.S.
is looked upon as one of
the guardians of apartheid”

“In South Africa, the United States,
Great Britain, and West Germany are
looked upon by blacks as the guardians of
apartheid,” states Leburu. “If all oouii»
tries would apply economic sanctions in
concert, they would be eiiective."

Leburu is quick to counter the argument
that blacks in South Africa are betterroff
economically than elsewhere in Alrica and
thus are not to be pitied, “The issue is not
how well-off we are compared to other
black Airicans, but rather to have our iair

by Bruce Eniond
s l was born in South Africa, as were my
father and paternal grandparents, but i do
not profess to be an expert on the country
or its political tribulations. However,
because oi my experiences, i believe im-
plementation of all active economic
measures, be they divesment, economic
and trade sanctions, is necessary to bring
South Africa into the twentieth century
and eradicate apartheid. .

i remember South Africa, where I lived
until the age oi eight when my tamily
subsequently moved to my mother‘s
British homeland, as an affluent society of
huge modern houses, swimming pools,
country clubs, and multistoried departs
meiit stores, Pristine and secure under the
year-round sun. South Africa is truly the
European Colonialist’s paradise, com-
parable perhaps to the society which Ms
isted in the American South during the
slavery era.

i remember, too, but more vaguely, our
black servants, the cook, our nanny, the
maid, and the male black servants who livV
ed at the end oi the yard in dank, musty
huts. I Wondered once why our cook would
leave for Several days every month or so.
but my parents dismissed my questions
with simple explanations tlial she was
returning to her home and children, and
that her husband was dead and she had to
work in Durban to support the iamily

Despite the developments ol the past
eighteen months, which, ior the most part,
have been confined to the black
"townships," the areas arbitrarily
designated by the South African govern»
ment as blacks’ rightful areas. the South
Africa of my Childhood has remained
relatively unaffected by the movement for
freedom. of course, White South Africans
are aware of the black quest ior equality;

they read about it in their newspapers and .

magazines, but it is safely distant irom
thier immediate world.

If sanctions are not imposed, the white
subjugation of the South Airican black will
remain and be perpetuated, in my opinion,
because South African whites, like their
racist counterparts oi the old South, will
never accede to demands for freedom
without their first feeling international
condemnation as a consequence oi their
system. The Airikaner, the descendant of
the original Dutch White settlers. (Prime

to receive parity. ,

My father, who grew up in a mixed
Afrikaner-English home, but has a more
objective View of the South African Situa-
tion atter living abroad ior many years,
says that the Airikaner mind set is
reﬂected in their language, In Afrikaans,
the language has connotations such that
Whites are the primary race and all others
are discounted as, unimportant to the
Afrikaner society,

'5They were ﬂipptmt about

the plight of the blades.”

My father lived until
adolescence in the small Afrikaner
railroad town oi Volksrust in the
Transvaal, and he remembers having
black playmates in his early childhood.
During the 1940:, there were no mandatory
education laws and few schools for blacks,
and he notes that around the school ages oi
six and seven, he suddenly became distant
and segregated irom his black peers, as
though they were beginning to adhere to
their designated roles within South African
society, If he was walking on the paves
ment, blacks would step into the street to
allow him to pass, in the 19505, my father
remembers how segregated public
iacilities like toilcts, stairways, and
restaurants began appearing in the town.
oiiicially affirming the Apartheid laws,
This ingrained racism, now part oi South
Africa's societal enculturatlon process,
and the Afrikaners' love for a land they
iought for in the bitter Boer War with the
British, makes it impossible that
Afrikaners will willingly relent to the ver-

his late

' hzl pleas of Western diplomats.

Americans should not target the great

South Airica is palgued with malnutri~
tion and unemployment as are other
African nations. And South Africa is the
only African country to still practice torcn

without water or sewage facilities.

The rent increases in the townships have
confronted many blacks with a difficult
choice, Black activists insist that rents be

other hand, has already started to evict

this year, ior example, a black gangster
killed several black schoolchildren in a
rampage that lasted several days, The onr

investigated." As soon as he went into a
town and killed a white traffic cop and a
garageman he was chased by police and
shot.

The government is quick to highlight
black-on-black violence in order to pro
mote the image of a divided black South
