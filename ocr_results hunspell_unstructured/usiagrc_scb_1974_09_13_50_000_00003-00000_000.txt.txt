Leach against ‘big money’

by Matt Cohen

Congreggional candidate James
Leach was on campus this week.
Leach, a Republican, is running in

the first district against incumbent
Democrat Ed Mezvinsky. He has
been active in the government both
in the Foreign Service and Working
ior Terry Lenzner at 0E0.

Along with manning a “Leach
for Congress” peanut stand, Leach
spent time talking to students
around the campus and in the Pub
and Forum grill.

In addi 'on to these around
campus activities, Leach spoke to
a gathering of students in south
lounge Tuesday atternoon.

Leach opened the meeting with a
brief statement outlining What he
saw as the major ioci or his
campaign He spoke initially of the
need for a new approach to politics.
He called for a reduction in
campaign rhetoric and promised
not to accept big money donations.

At the same time, he accused
Mezvinsky oi running a big money
campaign, accepting money trom
special interest groups, and oi
failing to report the sources of
$35,000 in campaign contributions.
While Mezvinsky acted within the

‘ law, Leach suggested that this was

inconsistent with Mezvinsky’s
support of campaign hnance
reform.

He called for a balancing of the

federal budget alid an end to deficit
spending. i-ie accused Mezvinsky
of inconsistency on this issue as
well, suggesting that Mezvinsky
was talking of reductions in the
budget but had tavored massive
increases in federal spending.
When asked which specific issues
he differed with Mezvinsky, he
stated that he wasn't familiar with
Mezvinsky’s voting record, He also
supported cuts in the deiense
budget, entorcement ol antitrust
legislation, and corporate tax
reform.

Leach said he generally would
put priority on housing tor the
elderly, health care and education.
He suggested that generally he
would vote as a moderate
Republican, rather than as a
liberal like Mezvinsky. He stated
that Congressman Mezvinsky has
a 96 per cent ADA rating to support
the contrast.

Leach spoke to turther issues at
the meeting, and in an S 8: E inc
terview after it. The interview, as
well as one with Congressman
Mezvinsky, will be presented next
week. Students should be aware
that Congressman Mezvinsky will

’strike drags on ,

Last Monday and Tuesday's
meetings with the federal mediator
failed to settle the Elrdayold union
strike by Building and Grounds
employees. Further meetings
between the two sides are being
scheduled by Joe Esselmaii, the
Des Moines federal mediator
participating in contract
negotiations,

The college upped Its first. year
wage increase to 23 cents, an in
Crease of 2 cents since the last olfer
made to the union Aug. 22. The
second year increase was
correspondingly raised to the 26
cent level, but the college offer for
one additional holiday remained
the same.

Union voters rejected the Sept, 5
offer by a vote oiddelo, The union is
reportedly asking tor a 35 cent
raise in the first year plus a costofs
living clause. aiid three additional
holidays.

Progress

Progress is being made, but the
two basic issues, wage increases
and cost-of-livlng clauses, continue
to stymie settlement plans.

The college calculated the latest
offer to be an 8 6 per cent raise in
current 1381C Salaries. President
Glenn Leggett stated that what the
union is demanding would “break
the college’s back” in terms of
balancing the budget, since any
higher wage increases would have
to be reﬂected in faculty salaries

next year. Hollis Sisco, union
steward, had no comment to make
about the college's statement.

Leggett said that he still has
hopes that the eight~\veek-old
strike can he settled by federal
mediation, rather than by binding
arbitration He expressed con-
fidence in Esselman’s professional
status as a mediator skilled in
settling contract disputes.

Pinkerton

Four weeks ago, the college
hired four Pinkerton watchmen to
guard potential trouble areas on
campus. Two guards are rovers,
while the remaining two men
watch at Quad and the physical
plant. So tar, no trouble has been
reported

Problems still plague campus
services, particularly those
dependent on deliveries, The Dorm
Care crisis oi cmpty lockers was
resolved by Ralph Fomerenk,
director of student services, who
organized the managerial labor
force that stuffed fresh linens and
towels in over zoo lockers by 9 a.m
last Monday, Sept. 9.

Vending machines, however, will
remain empty of cigarettes, cakes,
and candy bars until the strike is
over, as union truck drivers con-
tinue to honor picket lines,

additional headaches other than
tracking down deliveries and
