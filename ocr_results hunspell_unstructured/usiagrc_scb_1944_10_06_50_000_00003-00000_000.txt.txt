All S+uden+s Vo+e
In Favor of Honor
Sys’rem a+ Mee’ring

All women students voted to ac—
cept the honor system in exam-
inations at a mass assembly, in
ARH auditorium, Thursday morn—
ing. Since the men students
unanimously approved it in a
house mceting at Pine Tree Place
Monday night, the honor system
now has full student support [or
the year.

No violations were reported at-
ter the adoption of the honor sys
tem last spring, announced Gerry
Ross, student council president,
in proposing that the plan be
continued. She said the only
criticism which the faculty made
of its operation last spring was
that the nonconvel‘satlun rule
should have been enforced.

An honor court appointed to
judge violations of the honor sys-
tem was suggested by Miss Ross,
who said that the idea would be
discussed rurthcr belore being
presented to the students for ap-
pi-ovsl ncxt semester. She cine
phasizcd the prestige which, she
felt, should accompany member-
ship in the court.

The Illinois institute oi Tech-
nology in its campus newspaper
called Griniiell's plan ”a really
workable honor system,” accord-
ing to Miss Ross. The student
council Wll.l ask the studcnt body
to rcaitirm support or the honor
system each year until it has her
comc an established part or
Grinnell,

iod for those who are not
dents in the art department.

Presentation of student exhib»
its. as well as professional work.
will be one of the activities of
.me club. Meetings of the art
club will include lecture pro-
grams.

Music Soo’rhes - -

 

By Curtis iiamaclt ‘

In spite of what you might think
oi music otter hearing the male
preps' rendition of college songs,

'Grinnell does have a.“ Excellent

music department, complete with
a large sheet music and recording
library. and. of course, the best
in the line of instructors (and
I’m not getting paid [or saying
this, either.)

If, in your ”wanderings on
through campus ways" you fall
to hear the melodic tinkling of
a number or pianos (that is, us—
ually melodic) or quavering voi-
ces
you are either dear or unobserv-
ing. In either case, you are miss—
ing a big part of Grinnell college,

Should you really become our-
ious, however, you might trace
the origin of the delightful tones
(I am making the assumption)
and the search would lead you
to some or the practice rooms of
the music hall, or across the way
to Magcun Hall. Or perhaps, you
might hunt in one of the several
sweltering practice rooms (szev
tionately called “cubby-holes”
above the heating plant.

At any of these places you
would tind some musicians out
