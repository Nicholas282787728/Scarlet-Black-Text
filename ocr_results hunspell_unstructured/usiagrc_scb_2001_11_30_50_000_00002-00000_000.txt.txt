by David Chenault
Staff Writer

Monday afternoon, Sociology department
candidate Rabat-forms presented a talk entitled
“A: wove Always Done It: Negotiating Global.
iaition and Asserting Identity in Northern Spain."

The talk was a part otthc department's qumt
to create a new position; the process will continue
through the week or Friday, Dec. 2 This new
position within the department is intended to
expand rho number and breadth ofcourso 05ch

Torres is currently a PhD candidate in Dcch»
opmont sociologyat Cornell University, He uii.
dcrtook the research which formed the back-
ground for his locturo while in spam on a
Fulbright grant. He began his presentation by
discussing the relevancy he sees m inherent in food
as a subrect ofSociological study,

”Food transcend: boundaries food Func-
tions nar nniy 3 nutrition, but as CuiKurc,"TOfl’CS
said.

“Food [today] is doyoid of tradition," Torres
said “M have an intimato relation with food,
yet little knowledge or its origins."

Torres examined this question by discussing
the rise orProtectcd Designation ofongin (PDQ)
in three regions in Northern spaiii» Cataiuna,
Cantabiia and Galacia, He studied, respectively,
olive oil, blue choose and white wine production
in these areas. A PDo |.\ implemented by the
European Union and is a lsbol placed on food
which distinguishes its region or origin. Torres
said that a PM “legally guarantors food is pmr
duced in a certain piacc and manner,” in the case
ofTorros' case study in cataliinya, tiio siiirana
PDo designates the olivo oil produced in one
small town. and distinguishes its unique flavor
from that ofothcr towns in the same area, People
in spam identify so strongly with the subtltios or
havor.Torros said. that people rrom Barcelona will
drive two and a halfhours to buy olive oil from
the villagos in which they grow up.

Torres socs this strong rogional tinnity, winch

orton runs counter to the mass produced food
products available in grocory stores, as a way
orkccping in touch with the past. “ThePDo
is a mechanism oficsistanco," he said, and “an
assertion of identity People in a me see
themselves as maintainers ora cultural ttadie
lion."

Hc quoted one of tho cheese makers in
cantabriii as stating that “we do things as we’vc
always done it rhc PDQ just recognizes the
liei-itago "

“My impression otwhat he was doing was
that it was inctirodologiraliy and subsrantiyely
inttiosting rcscarcli this issue oragriculrural
sociology scents quite relevant to the college
givon iLs location," said McClelland.

After reviewing all the andidatcs, the dc»

How Egypt influenced Athens

Martin Bernal explains the importance ofAfrica in the shaping of ancient Grecian culture

by Marko Mircetic
News Editor

Twice at crinnell collcgo, once at the forum South lounge and once
again at Herrick chapel, visiting professor Martin Bernal, professor emetic
tus of govcrnment at Cornell University. challenged rhc Westcrn world
for maintaining a xenophobic, racist conception ofancient Greek, Egypt
train and Jewish history,

Betnal is the author oftwo volumes ofthc controversial Bbc/r Art/mm
series titled T/Je Fabrication o/Crccrc, and 771: Ar-c/acroiogienlnm/Door
mommy Ewe/cote and 777: Linguistic Euldzna‘. The Black Athena series
was begun in 1987 and Bernal': individual metircll began in 1975, The
serics has continued to expand since then,

Bernal was invited to spoak at Council College by joint sponsorship
of tho Noun program and Arricana studios concentration

In his talk, Bernal referred to two models of viewing ancient Greek
history, an "ancient" model and an “Aryan" model. berual contended that
the entirety ortho modern western world has adopted the Aryan model,
and that it is incorrect.

This Aryan model, perpetuatod by “right wing scholars who used Greece
to promote a European dominance," according to Bornsl, involves a se—
cluded image otancirnt Greecc unaffected by surrounding cultures, at-
ccpting European cultures.

in response to this view, actual afﬁrmed that, “Egypt was central to
the formation ofGtcecc and therefore ltwis ofthc highest level ofcivilizar
tion, and it Was black,"

Bernai willfully admits that the majoriry ofhis argument is {mod on
linguistic data and similarities between the Egyptian language and that of
the Giocks. There is a gap in tho knowledgo accrued through direct on
chaeological evidence, and Bornai hopes that future researchers will be
able to fill that gap. in Ecrml's words on nichncological evidence. “I think
that my critics are right; that is the weakest area or my work,"

Bernal also :lFﬂtmcd rirur his theories aro primarily based upon simple
models, rather than air analysis of the entirety of Greek culturo. This
primary point ofctiticisrn was justiﬁed in his convocation talk.

“I don’t believe facts do speak for themselves. 1 think you need simplie
fications. lfyou look at all ofthe completities and shifting angles, you
become paralyzed intellectually," said hornal,

Also, Bcrml believed that a great deal ofcrccian culture and language

tic interpretation,

“You could say i was leaving China, but I was really being attractod to

Therefore, according to Bernal, tlie maiority oihis research has bocn

Bernal has also published other works on rolated topics and intends to
