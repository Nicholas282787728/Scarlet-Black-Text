Professor Walker makes computer science fun with new book

MR MATH: Math pmtesw Henry Walker has published a hook on
problem- solving with computers that has received national attention.

 

By DANYA LEEBAW
Staff Writer
ENRY Walker, 3 mathemat-
H ics and computer science
professor. wanted to explore
some of tlte limitations of computers.
He accomplishes this task and many
more in his book, The Limits of
Computing, published by James &
Bartleu.

What is the history behind this
book? About four years ago, Walker
was pondering ideas for freshman tur
torial topics. Says Walker, “On the
one hand, I wanted to provide perspec-

tive and all those other tutorialrtype

For over thirty years, we've been exporting
America's most valuable resource.

ideas, but I also wanted it to relate to
computer science."

However. Walker wanted his stu-
dents to bear in mind the practical and
theoretiml limitationsofotxnputas. Says
Walker, “Certain problems simply can
not be solved Well, yes. somecan be
solved, butthe solution takes too long."

Hence,theidea forWalker'sbook
was born. Throughout the book.
Walker focuses on the difﬁculties that
arise in computing. A primary focus
of the book is the speciﬁc difﬁculty
thatarises when trying to solveaprob-
lem with a computer: for a successful
solution. one needs to identify all the
factors needingresponse. Walkersays,
"the likelihood of missing something
is very high."

Walker compares this problem
with riding a bicycle. Cenain factors
obviously must be considered, such as
pedaling and steering. Howeverpther
things cannot alwaysbeawounted for
before the actual bicycle trip. Walker
believes that this concept applies to
computers as well; it is impossible to
anticipateall thesituationsacomputer
may encounter.

Walker supports his contentions
with various examplﬂ, similar to the
bicyclingconcept, throughoutTheLim-

iii of Computing. He included many
examples, in an effort to make the
subject “real" for a large range of
people.

Publishing the book, Walker be-
lievcs,wasapo§tiveexperienceinmany
ways This is Walker‘s sixth book and
theﬁtstonetoreceive national attention.
The book has been umd all ova the
country in colleges, high schools and
even business schools. In addition,
Walker has been intervied on various
radio shows and in newspapers. The
book, mending to Walker, “put ittto
perspeaive the role of computing."

The acuial writing of the book
was also enjoyable for Walker. He
cites the Grinnell environment, in con-
trast to a research institution, as a fac-
torinthis. “AtGrinnell,”saysWalker,
“there isabroaderview of scholarship
and a much healthier View of scholar
ship.“

“There is always a question.”
states Walker, “about how much time
faculty shouldspend teachingandhow
much time time they should spend on
scholarship. Thenicepartofthiswork
is that both of these came together."

Walker attained his B.A., magna
cum laude.withhighesthonotsinmath-
ematics, at Williams College. He re-
ceived hisPhD. in Mathematics from
M.I.T. He received his MS. in Com-
puter Science from the University of
Iowa. Walker has been a professor of
mathematics at Grinnell since 1974
