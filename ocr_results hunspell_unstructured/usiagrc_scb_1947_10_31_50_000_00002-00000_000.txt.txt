Homecoming

If you live in a hall whose Homecoming
decorations brought back a cup last Satur-
day, you probably think we had a pretty
good Homecoming; or if you saw the Sc ‘
let and Black colne through with the \
.t'ory over Cornell, no doubt you're sure we
had a pretty good Homecoming. But if
you’re the fellow on the football team play-
ing in a makeshift uniform because some»
one burned yours last Saturday in a “spon-
taneous burst of Grinnell spirit”, you prob-
ably have your doubts!and justifiably s .

It's not a universal axiom that, when—
ever there is a celebration, there must be
destruction and violence to go with it; judg-
ing from what has happened, some students
seem to think so. The term Victory Day
doesn’t imply that there must be browbeat-
ing of the faculty with unreasonable des
mantis merely to get a day on nhich to
sleep late. Those who so forcibly demanded
this Thursday night by higll school vandal-
ism chose to forget the incident when a
genuine Victory Day showed the weakness
of their demands.

Not satisfied with this display of brav-
ado, others completed the program of de-
struction by burning the men‘s Homecom-
ing decorations, including irreplaceable foot-
ball equipment, in the final burst of this
distinct type of Grinllell spirit Saturday
night.

There was the other side of Homecoms
ing, of course. Fortunately, this was the
type of Homecoming which most of Grin-
nell presented to the alumns. This more
representative and genuine variety includ-
ed decorations in spite of the rain, an upset
which edged the USC game out of the head-
lines, and a Victory Day which no one dis-
puted.

That was Grinnell’s Homecoming—very
good for the most part, but not quite pelt
fact because of the deleterious contribution
of a small minority.

thankful amazement the improved Condi—
tions ill two areas of campus lile, namely
food and wages. The (lining rooms are just
short of becoming the places to eat, when
the dieticians let the students in. The food
has improved, although some 20 men were
locked olit of the dining room and went
hungry Thursday night. The reasons for
the lockout are not yet explained.

The student pay raise, though long in

coming, is nevertheless genuinely welcome
and indicates a definite cooperation on the
part of the administration in heeding the
needs of the students.

With the cooperation of the student
body, the Scarlet and Black feels that fu-
ture issues can be presented to the admin»
istration with equally valuable results. Univ
lateral action is not the solution for the

problems of any group.
