Lee Hawkeshaw Soesbe, the detec-
tive, has at last discovered why the
girls are always more prompt in ar-
riving at classes than the men. Lee
hid in the quadrangle clock, and
claims that each night about 8:37,
after every date is under way, the
clock is turned ahead ten minutes,
and left that way until the following
morning. Of course a few of the
girls receive some extra minutes, but
then that can be sacriﬁced in the in-
terests of promptness, don’t you
think? We don’t.

The theme song ran this picture is
"Looking At the World Through
Rose Colored classes," The scene
shown is Rosie, the hero, sitting on
top of the captain of the Washington
Bears. The scenario is a story at old
frontier days, when the brave
Pioneers went out and killed all the
wild Bears, and brought home a lot
of side meat. The children ate a lot
of the side meat, and grew up to be
fat and healthy so they could play
iootball for Grinnell college. The
premier showing of this photoplay
will be at Ward held Saturday, at 2
p. m.

Joe McKee, '29, is a homecoming
visitor in Grinnell. He is in the
School of Journalism at the Univer-
sity of Iowa.

Question: Do you think it is fair
that only men can play tennis in

Arthur de Persia—There is no
sense in being puritanical When we
have only one day of recreation it
should be devoted to healthy sports.

Mary Ellen Snavely—Of course I
think the women, should be allowed
to play on Sunday. There isn't any
good reason why they shouldn’t.

Vivian Finisher—I think the W0-
men should be allowed to use their
courts, Sunday is the one day ev-
erybody wants to play tennis,

Carleton HumphreyﬁI don’t see
any reason why the women shouldn't
play if the men do.

Blanche Hulsebus—As long as it
doesn’t disturb anyone, the ones who
want to play should have the pri-
vilege. ‘
