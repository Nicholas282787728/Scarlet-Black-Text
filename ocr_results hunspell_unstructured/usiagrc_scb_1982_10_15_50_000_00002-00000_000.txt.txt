J.B. fakes stand on buffer days, unruly
audiences, and sarcastic minutes

by Nancy Rademacher

Discussion at Wednesday's Joint Board
meeting centered on'a proposal presented
by the ad hoc buffer day committee, The
proposal, presented by committee
member Dan Nissenbaum and printed in
this Week’s 5&3, cxpounds recommenda
tions made in informational notices posted
by the committee in dorms and the dining
halls advocating the addition of one buffer
day each semester to the 1983134 acatic. ,2:
calendar.

The additional buiier day will require
extending the iinal exam period one day
and shifting graduation irom Monday to
Tuesday, Nissenbaum pointed out that,
once aware oi the need for a buffer day,
parents would accept the inconvenience oi
a Tuesday graduation. Joint Board voted
unanimously to support the proposal which
will be sent to the Committee on Academic
Standing in time ior the Friday, Oct 15,
deadline.

Last week's discussion of the format of
this year’s minutes continued with the
reading oi a letter written by absent
Younker Hall Presxdent Joe Neri. Read
ting to this week's sarcastically solemn
minutes, written by SGA Administrative
Assistant Marilyn zielinski, a response to
a student's prior request for more serious
minutes, Neri wrote, “Not only did you
choose to ignore his Comments on making
the minutes serious, but you mocked the
idea sarcastically " He added, “If you lnr
tend to treat iuture input irom any student
on this campus in this manner in the
future, I would like to ask for your resigna»
tion."

zielinski, replied that remarks in this
week's minutes were not intended to mock
this student or his recommendation. She
added that she would be, “more than hapr
py to do what the majority wants ,, Earlier

in the meeting, Zielinski herself had asked ,

JB members to “refrain irom negatively
criticizing each other."

Loose i-iall Co-President Katherine
Altemus added that Joint Board members
themselves were unresponsive to the stu-
dent's comments in stating, “I was embar-

rassed to be a member oi Joint Board. . . to
totally lambast someone like that at the
meeting is inexcusable.”

Debate on both issues was cut short by
SGA Vice-President Mark Bradshaw who
commented that, “If SGA is viewed as a
joke on campus, it's because of the more
dinate amount oi time we spend on smaller
issues."

Bradshaw then presented a letter to be
addressed to the campus- community
regarding behavior oi iilm audiences
Joint Board accepted the letter over~
whelmingly. Bradshaw added that in the
future, projectionists will turn off the iilms
when behavior becomes too unruly in
order to avoid serious incidents which
could result in personal injuries, a ban oi
alcohol in ARH or censorship oi the types
oi iilms that will be allowed to be shown in
ARH. Cowles president Steve Lisco ex»
pressed his concern over the ambiguity of
the term “unruly behavior," while JB
members agreed that the term implies
behavior which endangers the saiety oi
others, it was decided that iurther
clariiication may prove necessary

in other business, Bradshaw reported
that the Curriculum Committee had ap-
proved the revision oi the German major
He further informed Joint Board that, pens
ding trustee approval and funding, the
committee had approved a two-credit Rus-
sian study tour to take place in the Soviet
Union during winter breaks, The course is
a pass/fail addition to an already existing
eightrcrcdlt Russian course Finally, he
reported that Polish was being considered
for the critical languages program.

Bradshaw then informed Joint Board
that discussion of the nearly completed
SGA iniormation guide will be postponed
because the guide was not yet ready for
presentation. Answering questions about
the delay, Bradshaw explained that the
editor, Tracy Miller '82, did not finish the
work on schedule. and that Bradshaw's
own busy schedule prevented him from
assuming her duties.

SGA Treasurer Vern Juel then reported
that the general budget had received $1,500
less in student activities iees than was an
ticipated. He proposed that the SGA
Reserve Fund be used to replenish the
budget shortage.

in his report, initiative Fund Chairman
Eric Secoy reported that two allocations
were made this week: see to the Theater
EPC for this semester's Black Box Breaks
and $24 30 tor the Committee on Buffer
Days.

in new business author or last weeks
approved bylaw change Matt Golden pro
posed an amendment to the bylaw which
would reouiie the inclusion oi the text oi
proposals and letters to be discussed at
meetings with the agenda. l-ie iurther pro-
posed the purchase oi two SGA bulletin
boards to be placed outside Quad and
Cowles. Because oi the bylaw change,
discussion oi these topics was postponed
until the next Joint Board meeting.

Telethon organizers to accompany
winning team to Vail

by Kim MacDonald

once a casual fundraiser held in the sot.
ing, the Annual Fund Telethon has suddenr
ly mushroomed into a highly organized
and competitive money generator com
plete with grand prize vacations, senior
class challenges, and Pub Clubrspoiisorcd
orientation meetings

The highlight oi this year‘s fund drive is
the grand prize oi a weeklong vacation in
Vail. Colo., for the student team which
garners the most points The tclethon is
run by the Development (mice and three
student organizers, Chris Mui-ner, Scott
Ross and Amy Wolff One of the fringe
benefits of their involvement with the
telethon is that the three and Ross' wife
will accompany the winning team on the
week vacation in Vail. "We volunteered
before it was certain there would be at Vail
trip,” Murner explained, noting that,
“We'll be calling, but we're not eligible to
be a team." It was not known the
organizers were going to Vail until recent-

Relevance of tutorial still uncertain

by Cara Stein

For the past 13 years, the freshman
tutorial has been one of the few academic
requirements at Grinnell. The idea for the
program originated when faculty
members of the college began to notice a
steady decline in the reading and writing
skills of incoming freshmen.

The office of Academic Advising based
the design oi the program on other
freshmen orientation programs
throughout the country. According to the
Director of Academic Advising Ray Ober—
miller, Grinnell's program serves a dual
purpose: to provide a lower—pressure
course concentrating on reading and
writing skills applicable in any given
discipline, and to provide “a vehicle for
improving the advising system" between
students and faculty,

For the most part, professors volunteer
to teach tutorials and create,their own
topic and format, ‘Each tutorial proposed
is subject to the dean oi faculty's approval.
The topics range from nuclear energy to
autobiographical writing. The program
gives professors an opportunity to work
withtopics in which they have special in
terest or expertise and which tend to
deviate from the smndard curriculum
course offerings.

Administrative policy stipulates that no
first or second year professors can teach
tutorials. The administration believes that
new proiessors are not prepared to take on
the dual role oi professor and advisoi. The
advising aspect of the job can be extreme-
ly important to ireshmen who are oiten un-
sure oi their academic goals Generally,
students stay with their tutorial adviser
for a year and a half or until they have
chosen a major, 0ne oi the goals oi the pro-

kgram is for proiessors to know the student

well enough to know where his or her in-
terests lie and, at the same time, en-
courage the student to carry a diverse
course load.

Another unique aspect of the tutorial
program is the pass/fail grading system.
This was added to prevent freshmen from
being overly grade conscious and to help
them develop an attitude of “learning for
the sake of learning.” At the request of
professors who wanted a method of
recognizing outstanding performances,
”distinction" was added as an evaluation
mark. The Academic Advising Committee
is still not completely comfortable with the
distinction grade because they feel it has a
tendency w create a more competitive at-
mosphere during class discussion.

After speaking to a wide variety of
students, -ranging from freshmen to
seniors, it appears that the tutorial pro»
gram has received mixed reviews.
Freshman Sheryl Ziegler is presently tak-

_ing “Storytelling: Oral and Written

Forms" taught by French Professor Jan
Berkowiu. She describes her tutorial as
“interesting and a lot of fun with a
moderate amount of work.” Looking back
at her freshman tutorial, Ira Strauber's
“Rationality in Politics," senior Tracey
Wold thinks that class was “very difficult
at the time, yet in retrospect very
valuable.” A sophomore who has taken
Sheila McCarthy’s tutorial “Social
Upheaval in Literature: U.S.A, and
U.S.S,R." had this to say about the class:
“It was 10 times more difficult man any of
my other courses.” A junior who asked
that her tutorial remain nameless said, “It
was the biggest blow-off, I used to fall
asleep during discussion.”

Many students felt that the class turned

out completely diiterent from what they
had expected from the description sheet
they received during the summer before
their freshman year. As far as improving
reading and writing skills/most students
felt that since they were required to do so
much oi it, they were almost iorced to ime
prove.

when asked what improvements should
be made in the present program, Ober-
m'iller suggested “a greater emphasis on
oral presentations, since oral skills are
often neglected during the first couple
years at Grinnell, while later students are
saddled with senior project presentations
and job interviews." In the March 1982
issue of the Gr iieii Magazine, History
Professor Philip Kintner suggested some
ways of improving the program:
“Glamorize the tutorial and demote it at
the same time.” His suggestions for
upgrading tutorials include “alloting bet»
ter teaching hours. . rewarding suc-
cessful instructors, . . teaching them more
pedagogy and. . . separating tutorials
from departments both financially and
curricularly." Kintner believes that the

tutorial program tries to accomplish too,

much. He thinks that departments should
“supplement” the tutorials by oiiering
remedial courses. These remedial courses
would help students attain the skills
necessary to handle regular courses while
taking less intensive courses such as
tutorial,

Besides being an interesting academic
device, the tutorial often helps ease the
social tension during New student Days. it
is inevitable that you spend your hrst cour
pie meals with your tutorial classmates
discussing “The Ideal of the University”
or your hometown.

ly, but Murner claims that all the teams
are now aware of that feel

Because or rules they established, the
three cannot torm a team, but according to
Murner, "We've worked beiore and got
good results and put in lots of hours," Ross
added that the has "worked every tclethon
since the spring or 1930,"

Ross' wife will accompany the group as
an official college chaperone New regula
tions Concerning the use of college vehicles
require that a member of the college staff,
such as Deb Ross who works in the Office
or Development. accompany the trip win-
ners.

The Vail vacation is not the only new ad
dition; due in part to increased organiza-
tion, the committee will hold tclethon
orientation workshops on Thursday, Nov
4, and Saturday, Nov, 6, at 7 pm. in The
Pub Free beer, soda and chips will be pro
vided by The Pub for the two meetings.
Pub Manager Paul Cohen explained that
his generosity stems irom a desire "to
show that The Pub is ,1 student organiza-
tion that‘s helping out." Murner feels that
the orientation meeting will ”increase effi-
ciency" oi student callers. The purpose of
the meeting, Murner said, is to explain the
calling process and to provide free
refreshments at The Pub as “an
incentive" for Student teams to attend
During the meeting, the group will also
show a short Vail promotional film.

in another display ol generosity, Murner
and Ross are themselves contributing a
maximum of $300 to the Student Activities
Endowment Fund as a Challenge to the
senior class. Murner and Ross hope that
they can get the seniors to contribute
$1,000 to the SGA fund which is intended to
benefit future classes at Grinnell. In addir
tion, the two are attempting to secure a
three year pledge irom the seniors to
reach a goal of $10,000 by 1986. Under a
type oi installment plan, they hope that'
each senior will agree to contribute ap-
proximately 330 over the next three years,

The purpose oi their challenge is, accor-
ding to Ross, “to help stimulate the seniors
to give this year." Murner believes that
there are “a lot of reluctance and
misconceptions about giving to the
tclethon," When questioned about the
motivation behind such generosity,
Murner explained, “It s justsomething we
want to do” .we re using a resource and
we want to replenish it" Ross added,
“Students have to realize that Grinnell is a
private school and the only reason that the
college has money now is because of
previous alumni donations."

This is the first year that an alumnus has
donated a prize to the telethon, and
Murner and Ross hope that this will "start
a chain reaction.” “Everyone wants to be
a part. . . “ according to the organizers
who noted that 80 percent of the team slots
were filled on the first day of registration
