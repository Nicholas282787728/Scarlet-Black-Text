Conference Lending Oklahomans
in Kol'mllll Tonight.

Tonight the Pioneers quintet will
meet the Oklahoma U, Soonel‘s nt
Nnrnlall. 'Al. present the soutllel‘ners
are on top in the Championship 1' Ce
with a perfect record and from all
indications they will lic hard to beat
out of valley honors. They hold vies
tories over Kansas, li'ashiilgton,G i-
nell, Anles and have walloped Drake
twice, none of the victims being able
to hold the Sooners to a very close
Score.

The Oklahoma attack is fast and
uses all five men on the offense,
thereby making guarding difficult.
The men are rangy and quick, and
show up well against a smaller team,
as they can use an air passing system
The two guards are liig and are hard
men to score against.

In Captain McBride and Hones: Ok-
lahoma has two of the best forwards
in the conference, the latter being in
fifth place among the leading scorers.
Price and Niblick are two stellar cent-
ers. Each can lead the attack and is
practically sure of the till-offs, Nih-

umn, while Price is not unicb further
down the list. Holt is another reliable
man who has been used at the pivot
position.

At guards, hfnorc nod Holler have
been the most effective throughout the
season. They are big men and work
the ball out of the Oklahoma territory
in quick order. Neither shoots much
as the ball is fed to one of thc dnwnv
court men. lcCront has seen some
senior, and on the town invasion
succeeded in getting eighteen points.
Dunlap is another mrd .who has
showcd up well in Valley ginncs

siib forwards includc “'cst and
Stephens, both of whom seem to be
able to hit the hoop quite regularly.

A victory over this outfit would
boost Gr ncll greatly in the confers
ence latilig', and with a win chalked
up last night over the Oklahoma Age
sles, the Pioneers should have
enough confidence to give the Sooucrs
a real battle.
