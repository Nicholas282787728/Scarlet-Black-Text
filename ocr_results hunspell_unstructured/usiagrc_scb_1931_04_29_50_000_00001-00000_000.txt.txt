Despite the fact that the sopho-
mores were leading at the end of the
ﬁrst day's competition. the senior-s
still remain topheavy favorites to win
the annual Grinnell home meet, be-
cause of their superiority in the new
events which are being held today.
The sophomores held a two-point
margin over the seniors Tuesday,
while the juniors and freshmen were
next in order.

Dick Murphy, dependable Pioneer
middle-distance runner, shattered the
only record of the day when he travel-
ed the half mile in 2:021, one-tenth
of a second faster than the old record,
He ﬁnished far ahead of the ﬁeld and
might have run faster if pressed: '

Sophomores Start Fast

The sophomores started out 'aus-
piciously, Alexander and Pojman
winning ﬁrst and second in both the
100 and 220 yard dashes. They pulled
far to the front with Pilbrow‘s vlc~
tory over McIlrath in the mile. The
seniors closed the gap steadily, how-
ever. aided by Hensley, Murray, and
Douglas. who ﬁnished one, two. three
in the 120 yard high hurdles. Hensley
also won the low hurdles.

Pferffer gave the freshmen their
only ﬁrst place when he outdistanced
Seccr to win the two-mile run in
10:14. Thomas came through with a
victory in the quarter-mile, barely
nosing out H. Edwards. Murphy, sav-
ing himself for the half mile. loafed
through to take fourth place,

Loyrrachcn Frosh Hope

The seniors were expected to score
heavily in the ﬁeld events today, be-
ing virtually certain of ﬁrsts in the
shot, discus, and polevault, The soph-
omores should hold their margin over
the juniors. barring upsets, while
Loynachan should pull the freshmen,
who had only nine points at the end
of the ﬁrst day, back into the run-
ning.

Riniker, Murray at National
Meet Find Grinnell
Well Advanced

“We came away feeling that Grin-
nell rs well advanced in the solving
of campus problems,” said Leta Rini-
ker, president of the women's self
government league, ~when she return-
ed Monday from Ann Arbor. Miss
Riniker accompanied by Georgia
Murray, president-elect, attended the
ﬁfth biennial session of women stu-
dents, April 22 to 26, at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.

The theme of the meeting was the
social adjustment of the college girl
to the campus. In development of this
idea. Grinnell delegates were 'iin-
pressed by the addresses by Miss
Nellie Lee Holt on “The purpose of
the women’s solf government assoc-
iations," Mrs. Frederick B. Fisher.
“International Relations," and Miss
Ethel McCormick, “Orientation
Week."

All States Represented

The 125 delegates who represented
every state. participated in discus-
sions according to the size of the
School, ‘41 was interested in getting
the viewpoints of both large and
small schools,” remarked Miss Mur-
ray, “but I was still further impress-
ed by the fact that the lack of soror-
ities and fraternities decreases the
number of social problems.”

Senior delegates were appointed to
serve on various committees as part
of the convention program. Miss
Riniker acted on the committee deal-
ing with the resolutions and hy-laws
of the national association,

See Musical Comedy

Among the entertainments for the
delegates was a musical comedy,
“Came the Dawn.” The music, words,
costumes, scenery, and acting were
handled by the junior women of the
university.

The conventions alternate between
national and sectional meetings, Next
year a sectional assembly will be held
at the University of South Dakota in
Vermillion. Cornell university, Ithaca,
N. Y, has been selected for the na-
tional convention the following year.

Horseback riding is not the only
sport responsible for the limping:
about the campus. If your professorl
comes to class with a battered eye,‘
you may rest assured that it was un-
doubtedly received in one of the vol-
leyhall games in which the men ofl
the faculty are participating every
Wednesday night at the men's gym-
nasium,

The moving spirit of the crusade
to avoid that coming shadow and to
provide wholesome recreation for the
professors is Milton Whittier, assist-
ant professor of education, who prod‘sl
on any lagging enthusiasts. J. M.‘
Bridgham, professor of Latin, stars
in the game, as does “Cannonball"
Craig, so called because of his deadly
serve. It is rumored that Professor
Charlton’s greatest ambition is to
surpass all other stars, in spite of his
acknowledged superiority, at the net,
for any morning he may be seen do-
ing his mile to keep in training.

Harper. Russell Smith, Mitchell
Dreese, Ralph J. Moore, Herschel M.
Colbert, and Harold Sowerby Wilson.
In addition, a few favored local ci i-
zens mingle with the champions.
An average of ﬁve games are play-
ed each evening. Last Wednesday
night when Professor Wittler's team
forged ahead of Professor Wood's out-
ﬁt to win by the score of 3 to 2, it
was charged that the victory was un-
fairly won, hecausc of the one-sided
rooting.

Too Much R00 rg

Mr. Wittler's fox terrier, tied to the
bleachers, gave his canine encourage-
ment whenever his master made a
“coup de maltre.” Mitchell Drcese
threatens to overcome the opposition
by tying his dog to the opposite
bleachers.

The climax to the efforts of the
faculty athletes is the annual ladies
night, to which the wives and friends
of the participants are invited. Pro-
fessor Wittler is the head of the com-
mittee in charge but the deﬁnite date
has not been set.
