 

A change in your social life
Brad Vander Linden

In the current session of the Iowa
Legislature, a bill under Consideration to
raise the current drinking age from 19 to 21
years of age would radically alter the
social life of the campus before concerted
student opposition could be mounted to
defeat the measure. Only a few groups on
campus such as the Pub Board, SGA and
the Grinnell College Democrats have been
discussing the proposed law and its poten-
tial effect on the Grinnell campus. None
have yet devised a unified lobbying
strategy to push for its defeat. Student
reaction to the proposed law has been a
combination of ignorance and indif-
ference.

The rationale behind the bill is that it
would reduce drunk driving accidents in
the 19 to 25-year-old category; the only
category that has not fallen substantially
since stricter laws were imposed to deal
with problem drunk drivers on the state's
roads. All current statistics show a mark-
ed overall decrease, except for this
category, in traffic deaths due to drunk
driving since the midrsos when cars were
heavier and faster. stricter penalties im»
posed by the legislature in the last ses-
sion, including automatic license suspen~
sion for refusing to take the blood-alchohol
test after being stopped by a law enforcer
ment officer, are largely responsible for
the decrease.

Yet those wellemeaning legislators who
View increasing the drinking age to 21 as
the way to control drunk driving among
the iozoycarold group may only com-
pound the problem. More than likely, we
will see a proliferation of fake I.D,s, with
19-zoyear—old moving from the bars to
cruising and drinking while driving on the

state's streets and highways, making
themselves an even bigger menace to all
drivers.

Given this possible effect on the already
declining rates of accidents due to drunken
driving, the bill to raise the drinking age
would be a setback for college students
around the state, eroding their privileges
as adults and radically altering the social
life on Iowa's campuses. On the Grinnell
campus, as on all other campuses in the
state, a profound change in students’
lifestyles would result.

All-campus parties and dances would be
dry, and ﬁle change in the drinking law
would quickly kill the Pub. The law would
not be retroactive, so those already 19 and
20 could still drink legally in the Pub and
the bars in town. But due fresh crop of
io~2oyear-olds that the Pub would depend
upon to stay in business would be cut off.
The Pub would begin to die a slow deaU’i
from lack of new ieyearolds, and in only
two semesters it would fade into memory
as Grinnell tradition. Already some facul-
ty members are thinking about converting
the Pub into a faculty club it the bill asses
in this session of the legislature.

A more mundane social life without
alcohol at parties and no Pub would in
evitably result from raising lowa's drink-
ing age to 21. Any hope of the college ad-
ministration looking the other way when it
comes to enforcing the law at parties is
wishful thinking, for it would be expected
of the college to set policies that are in
keeping with the new law.

’Students at Grinnell, because they voted
in such heavy numbers in the last election.
more so percentage wise than any other in
stitution of higher learning in the suite,
have the most potential inﬂuence to suc-

cessfully lobby for the bill’s defeat in the
fowa State House. State Rep. Janet Carl
(Dem.-Grinnelll,former Associate Dean of
Students at Grinnell, knows bettter than
any other legislator the devastating effects
the law would have on college social life at
Grinnell and around the state if the drinks
ing age were raised to 21. Students gave
her the slim 49 vote margin that reelected
her» to another term in the Iowa
Legislature. State Senator Joe Brown
(Dem-Montezuma) benefited too, though
to a lesser extent, from the heavy voting
by Grinnell Students. Both are possibly the
best advocates Grinnell students have in
the state, and they should be persuaded to
take up active opposition to passage of the
increased drinking age,

if Grinnell students want to see that
their interests and the interests of all col-
lege students around the state are address-
ed they must mke the initiative in asking
Representative Carl to organize active op-
position to the bill on the house floor and
for State Senator Joe Brown, should the
bill pass the house, to work for its defeat in
the State Senate before it gets to the
Governor who will likely sign it into law.
The students who voted in the last stave-
wide election should call on me leaders of
the Campus Democrats, their hall presir
dent, Joint Board and the Pub Board to
begin formulating a unified, campusewide
strategy to gain their representatives ac»
tive opposition to raising the drinking age.
The best recourse of all is for individual
students to write Carl and Brwon, enr
couraging them to take up active opposi-
tion to the bill. A few hundred letters to
your representative is the best means to
ensure action and see that your interests
as students are protected.

 

 

 

 

Fade to Black

A Call to Enlightenment

This month marks Grinnell College's
first formal recognition of Black History
Month. Nationwide, February is the month
aimed at promoting consciousness of the
integral functions which black Americans
have performed and continue to perform,
in the construction of our society. It is a
time of year when proud, spirited blacks,
along with many enlightened cohorts, at
tempt to endow others with insight. If you
find yourself asking “What kind of
insight?," then chances are you haven't
truly realized the overwhelming impor
tance of blacks in this country. Or, it is
possible that you prefer to ignore the
realization. In any case, Black History
Month is an especially appropriate time to
commit one’s self to the development and
contemplation of this insight. It is a time
when enlightenment is designed to spawn
enlightenment. However, this month is not
the only time to develop fresh perspectives
on the undeniable importance of the fuch
tions performed by black Americans
within the society. Throughout the whole
year, there are opportunities to gain this
insight, and Grinnell’s “liberal“ at-
mosphere would seem conducive to this
process.

Black Americans are unequivocably
becoming an overt force in the upper
economic, political and social strata of the
United States, It would appear logical that
those of greater consciousness and
foresight would become informed about
the black culture. It is certainly possible
that this may be to your benefit.

Think, for example, oi one who prepares
himself for voyage to a foreign land, Ace
quaintance with some fundamental tools is
essential in order to understand and to
coexist with the culture, such as basic
language, history and contemporary
issues of the place to be visited. Or, con-
sider the line of thought that one follows
when planning to give a presentation of
some length and depth. of course, itseems

only sensible that one become versed in
certain facets of the Subject to be discuss-
ed, such as current developments and
historical trends relevant to that subject.
In both cases, acquaintance with the sub-
ject in question emerges as a wise and
beneficial indulgence. To a great degree,
knowledge of the subject can become a
valuable asset.

However, In a “liberal" institution of
Grinnell's caliber, very few people
demonstrate interest in developing insight
into the black American culture. That is,
unless there's a dance sponsoring a
“funky" band. That's fine, but there's
more to appreClate than that, And even
though many believe that they have
become familiar with black culture, that
belief is still qualified with certain
ramifications. Recently, at a panel discus-
510“ on the appreciation of diversity in
Grinnell, one student remarked that ample
acquaintance with black American culture
is provided by the media. That’s really too
bad. Fortunately for people with this
frame of mind there is another depiction of
the unique black American culture with
which to become acquainted; one free of
the negative implications and attitudes
frequently employed in the media,

This month, as well as any other time
when events are generated in the interest
of black culture. enlightenment is really
the aim of the efforts. Of course, there are
the devoted few who attend various funce
tions such as lectures and panel discus
sions. That’s nice to see. Contrary to the
popularly held view, most functions given
at Grinnell in the interest of black Culture
are not exclusively directed at blacks ~ or
there would be no need for notes in Memos,
calendars and posters, inviting "all” to
events.

it was interesting to note the attendance
of so many people at the lectures given
recently by Lawrence Wylie, who spoke on
subjects such as French body language.
Well, certainly many there had majors

Natalie Ward

other man French, sociology or an
thropology. Why didn’t uiey get the imr
pression that Professor Wylie's lectures,
elaborating on a culture much more dis
tant to many of them than that of black
America, was only directed at French,
sociology and anthropology majors? The
attendance of students in other majors
points to another salient feature of the ac-
tual lack of interest in black culture. Atten-
dance at such events as Wylie’s lectures
are imually encouraged, and sometimes
required, by professors. It is hard to
believe that many of the functions given in
the interest of black culture cannot be
found complimentary to certain
disciplines. Perhaps more of the faculty
can help to inspire interest in functions,
since it's very possible that a certain lec~
ture or movie may enhance materials be-
ing taught in class, When this
is done effectively, much interest can be
stirred among students who may be inclin-
ed to "turn other students on," And this
suggestion is mainly directed to faculty
members outside areas Such as Afro-
American history or literature. Again, the
appreciable aspects of the culture do not
stop here.

So, it seems that ”A Call to Enlighten-
ment" is in order at Grinnell. Consider
black American Culture, because it's def-
ninltely here and can't be avoided. There's
much to the culture - don't cheat yourself
by relying on the media to provide the
basis for that realization. Or even one
black friend won’t provide the proper in
sight — but maybe the proper impetus
The benefits to come from that insight can
be rewarding, similar to those gained by
going to that dreamedoi foreign land or
the success enjoyed after u welleglven
presentation. it all lies in the preparation.
and efforts such as Black History Month at
Grinnell College should be appreciated as
opportune tunes to get the preparation A
little enlightenment has never hurt
anyone.

to
eating alone

Steve
Burnett

The title is sort of misleading, because
actually it’s a guide on how to avoid eating
alone,

But first, I think it behooves me to list a
few reasons why you should not eat alone.
Really there's only one reason — what
other people will think oi you — but this
should be examined in greater detail.

(1) They will never in their lives believe
that you have a friend in the world.

(2) They will believe that there's
something wrong with you.

(37 They will share at you.

(4) They will discuss nothing else during
dinner.

<5) They will never forget. Long after
the incident, you will see them pointing at
you and whispering to their friends. You
can't hear them, but you know what
they're saying. “I saw him (or her) eating
alone once."

Remember the last time you saw so-
meone eating alone? What did you think
about that person? Huh? Come on now, am
lriglitl

Well. here are the ways to avoid eating
alone,

(17 Don't eat.

(2) Skind at the salad bar for 20 minutes
or as long as it takes before people you
know come in, and wait until they're ready
to sit down. This can be accomplished by
pretending to make a salad.

(3) Act like you‘re going to eat in a
PDR, and then take your tray back to your
room, If you don't live in Cowles, this is
somewhat tricky to pull off,

I don't recommend using the first
method mo often.

ovtoo-onevtot-ox:ooovvvtonotoxox-oovtox-o

I've got a message for the people who
run IM’s. How dare you! I‘ve never been
so insulted in my life! To hire students to
officiate games. Such insenstivity. Don't
you realize that these games are impor-
tant? They will have a lasting effect on not
only the college but the entire state of
Iowa. Nay, the entire country, The out
come of each game is more important than
anything i can think of.

And then you have the gall to make a
rule that players can't swear at refs or the
other team. That‘s like tying one hand
behind the back. How‘can you expect
anyone to be able to put in anything
resembling a hallway decent performance
if he/she can't complain about the calls?
And besides, they deserve it. They’re prete
ty sneaky. They’re out there trying to
make everyone lose.

At the very least you should let us hurl
epithets at the opposition. They're the
enemy! My God, they want you to lose:

For those of you with long memories,
this might look familiar. Last year I wrote
something much on the same lines as this.

i don't really feel people have been ob-
noxious lately. For the most part. But then
there are cases that just burn me. Like this
one: His team was up 20 points, Less than
two minutes. He was fouled. He called the
guy who fouled him a “loser," since
because of the foul he missed a shot.

“You loser," That’s what he said. He
was Winning, [or cripes sake
