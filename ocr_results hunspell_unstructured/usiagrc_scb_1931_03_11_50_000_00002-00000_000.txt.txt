INDIA GAINING GROUND

The recent dgrccllicrtt between Lord Irwin,
Viceroy of India. and Mahatma Gandhi was reached
after three works of doubt mid di 'cty throughout
India and Great Britain. Civil disobedience. lllc
weapon whose use Gandhi has most effectively
maintained, must now be cost aside. Does this mean
that the ZlChiOVelllClli for which India has been
struggling, that of complete independence from
England, has been pushed farther bocli on the horie
zon? Some judgment of the present situation may
he formed from a consideration of lhc gains made
in both quarters by the scitlcmcnt.

Along with Gandhi‘s discontinuance of the pro-
gram of civil disobedience, which amounts to il
pledge of peace, goes Britain’s promise to free
political prisoners not guilty of violence; there are
twenty thousand of them. Although a tax iipon
salt will Still be lavied, salt manufacture by the
poor for their own consumption will be permitted.
Great Britain. yet a hit wary will release thet
prisoners but slowly, silica she \ ishcs to make cer-
tain that Gandhi’s order of truce is genuincll' efr
foctivc. Statutes against those who have practiced
civil disobedience will be repudiated; ordinancen
promulgated during the movcmem are being grad-
ually withdrawn,

The release of the Indian prisoners is zi dis
tinct victory for Gandhi, for even while Britain
refuses to allow civil disobedience, she has by her
own act, tacitly admitted the justice of it. Gandhi
himself does not regard the suit concession us of
ﬁnancial importance to his nation, hut he do - do-
clnre that it is it marked indication of the shifting
cconomic lllld politi ol status of India. Thnt or lili-
ances enforced during civil disobedience arc being
Repealed is also of importance. It looks as though
the odds were deﬁnitely placed with tllc Indian
liberator.

Since Gandhi has agreed to participate in
another roulldtahlc conference, intcrcst in the full
session of the congress party, due to meet tit Karin
chiol’l March 26', hits been revived. Even while
Great Britain i. relieved (it Lord Irwin’s lost stroke,
she cannot quitc forget that at throo former coir
vcntions of congress party delegates. the repre-
sentatives hovc uudllimou y odoptcd rosolutious
favoring complete independence for India. If
Gandhi is ohcycd, llldifl should rapidly become
more amicable toward a discussion of a constitution
for India, but the terms of the agreement go far
beyond the more calling of a truce to quell disordc .
It is too soon to estimate \Vlitii cffcct lhc ilpein.
tioll of the congrcss party will have, but it is core
tain that the Indians, having gained so luucl
ground, will he unsoti. led with less than mag/nonl-
mous concessions on the port of England. The
future complete independence of India is rapidly
becoming a realityJIiiida Wendell

CUTTING CLASSES

To cut or not to cut find why?

Now that the casualty list of total cuts and

system at Grilllicll would not be out of ul'lll‘l‘ for-
the freshmen and others who wonder wlllit it is

The regulations in the student directory read:

“Eighteen full weight abscn cs intiuitd in
any semester shall reduce the total credit lowm'd

absences are given half weight.”

But here is the paragraph which is oitcu lliis-
understood:

“Onc half the number of absences incurred

SENSATIONAL COLLEGE NEWS
('From the Balolt Round Table)

Daily newspapers are still dragging Michigan's un-
fortunate fraternity house padlocking into the papers.
They are including the Duke house at Madison in the
Wickersham report. They are digging up a political
scandal about Iowa to broadcast to the publi . They
place before the general reading public a picture of
college life that indarnes the ideas of many who already
believe that students only carouse around and dissipate.

The accusation alone of drinking places a stigma
on the accused in the eyes of many of the “liberals"
of today. Pointing a ﬁnger at the fraternity house will
cause those who read the report to believe the story
true for all the groups and members of that fraternity.
Innocent men, and it is improbable that every occupant
of the five houses at Michigan is guilty, will be con—
sidered immoral by their conservative families and fam-
ily friends. The papers have gone so far as to print
the names of many of the men involved.

Beloit‘s Daily News published a report oxonernting
the accused house at Wisconsin. This has no news value
to larger dailies, however, because only the sensational
news or the fall of modern youth will be of interest to
the public. In fairness to educational institutions and
to the worthy men and women attcnding them, the press
would do well to publish more than the sorry side of
college life, regardless of its news value.

was received recently from a sup-
erintendent of schools:

Dear Si

Missi is doing good work
for her ﬁrst experience. She has
made several mistakes, but I feel
is improving.

The fact that Grinnell women
are allowed to smoke has hurt her
reputation, and some of our board
members think Miss uses
tobacco. For this reason it may be
difficult for her to be re—elected.
Personally I feel that she is 0. K..
but everyone does not feel that
way.

I've sure got a fine collection of

of Chinese lopping off heads of their

tives understand what you're trying

only get about $130 per day, but
they‘re not worth even that,

As a side line down here I've got-
ten into the little theater work. About
the time that I a‘trived.the new club
house was completed. It had a pretty
fair stage, and the only use they had
developed for it was to put on a
couple of lousy amateur plays. Find-
ing a group of people that were ins
tereated, I went to work with them
to put the stage into first class con-
dition, and get the best plays that
were suited for this place. We're getr
ting along in the best of shape.

I've got experienced stage hands,
a very smart play reading committee,
and some assistants that have been
in the heart of New York theatrical
work. Things are breaking favorable

tion of 5300 made to its treasury as
a result of the Grinnell-Drako char-
ity football game.

for this splendid piece of work, and
the substantial litt thus given, to
Grinnell college, to the coach, to the
players, and to all who had any part
in making the plan a success.

This addition to our funds is all
the more appreciated because of the
present unemployment, which is
greatly increasing the calls for aid.
