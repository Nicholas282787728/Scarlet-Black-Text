I' want my MPP

As I'm sure many oirny peers will remember, we used
ro have menu irern oprions in me dining hall known as
“Qricken PnrryParnresan” and “Meatless Parry Pdrrnesun."
They eonsisred of a parry (chicken or soy), wirh cheese
mdred on rop, served alongside poem and marinarusauoe.
They were one ofrhc more popular menu irems provided
by Dining Services. 1 would eren go so far as ro say drey

Gonnellians). This year 1 have wirnessed rhe gradual dis—
