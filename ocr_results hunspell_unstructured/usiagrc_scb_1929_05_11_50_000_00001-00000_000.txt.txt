Locals Invade
Creighton for

Track Contest

Scribe Gives Team Chance

to Win Without Miner,
Taylor, Risser.

Miner Biggest Loss

McKee Will Run Dashes; Condi-

tion Keeps Hurdler Out; Wen.
ger Replaces sick Miler.

A crippled Grinnell college track
team left Grlnnell Friday night to do
or die against Creighton at Omaha. to»
day and as matters stand, it should
n‘t do so badly even chi-ugh some of
the stars are missing.

\Varrler Taylor. hurdler and sprint
star delux, is peaceably going about

his varied pastimes here. owing to a .

current condition which a local ’rul-
ing requires he made up a week be
fore competition. Kisser. lanky mil—
er. has been sick and Coach Duke
announced that W'enger would prob-
ably be entered in the mile instead
of the half mile. Miner. the snappy
Sophomore Speedster. is still out with
is pulled endon and Duke believes
that his loss is one of the greatest to
the squad.
Hensley To Hurdle

\Vith Miner out, Duke is compelled
to Mull McKee from llis regular race.
the 440. and run him in the 100 and
22!). Hensley has been pushing Tay-
lor hard in some of the hurdle races
and he Will probably show the
Creighton youth some speed. Macy
will Tnke Taylor's place in the mile
relay team. The [act that Taylor is
out may force the rest of the mem-
bers of he unit to push things 5. bit.
but Duke is confident that his quartet
will cop first.

Field Events Count.

As was expected in the Carleton
meet, the running events will be more
or less evenly divided and it will de-
pend upon the field events for the
winner. Grinnell, although its team
has made no spectacular marks in
the field. should be able to take its
Share a! points there just as against
Carleton and. such being the case will
come out somewhere near the top.

Thieves Break Into Office
of Local Lumber Company

The office of the Richardson and
Phelps Lumber Company was broken
into “lednesday night by thieves. The
loss was small. a navy blue sweater-
coat and a grey chamois jacket be-
lug the only things stolen. Twenty
dollars in cash was overlooked in the
money drawer.

Entrance was gained through a
window by breaking a. pane of glass
and than unlocking the catch.

This is the second robbery in Grin-
nell during the past few weeks. and
there have been numerous other
Smaller lurcenies of auto robes. chickv
ens and spare tires. according to re-
ports from the police department.

meetings.

Senior exercises have entirely dis-

Dulcimers Sun Publishes
Mission Article by Card

A “revolutionary change in the aims
and methods of Christian activity in
the Orient" is described by Prof.
Wayne Gard of Grinnell in the Sun-
dny magazine section of the Baltimore
Sun for May 5. In an article entitled
“The Missionary Changes his Tac-
tics,“ Mr. Gard discusses the recent
efforts of missionaries to disengage
themselves from political entangler
ments, to seculax-ize their educational
institutions. and to adapt themselves
in various ways to a wary and skep-
tical East. .

Mr. Gard, who recently spent three
years in India as a press correspond-
ent. points out that the evangelistic
aspect of mssionary Work is being
emphasized less than formerly, and
that the work of preaching is being
pastors, in the belief that they can
do u. more effectively than the [or-
left more and more to indigenous
eigners.
