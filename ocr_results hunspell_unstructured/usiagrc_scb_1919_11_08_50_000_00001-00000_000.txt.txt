PROGRESSIVE GRIN

NELL NEEDS

THREE AND ONE-HALF MILLIONS

Archibald Cattell Associ

ates College and Labor

Problems—Drive For Endowment Fund
Opens With Alumni Banquet.

(By Staff Representative).

DES MOINES, Nov. 7, 1919 'Is it
more important to mind the train or to
train the mind?” was the challenge
hurled at the Grinneli alumni at their
annual banquet at the Savery tonight.
This was the substance of a speech
by Archibald Cattell, '91, of Chicago,
one of the speakers at the inaugunr
tion of the three and a half million
dollar endowment cmapaigu, which
was formally announced at the ban»
ouet. He was speaking of the differ—
ence of Wages that the railroad train-
men get and those paid to college pro—
tensors.

Several hundred grads attended the
affair, the number being greater than
usual because of the many Grinnel-
lians attending the teachers’ conven-
tion held here this week. The ban—
quet served as the ﬁrst formal an—v
nouncemeut of the coming drive for
the new endowment.

Main First Speaker.

President J. H. T. Main was the ﬁrst
speaker. In a short talk he told of
the great need for the new endowment
saying that now is the time that Grinr
nell needs the support and loyalty oi
every alumnus more than ever beiore.
He,p0intcd out that Gl‘inneil,‘.0f all
colleges deserves the money, as a
standard and leading college of the
middle west, because it Was the ﬁrst
college West of the Mississippi, be—
cause it has been a leader in educa
tional development, and because its
'ivork has been recognized to such an
extent that Griuneli people can sit
with people of any institution in the
country on an equal basis.

“The history of Griunell has been
a glorious one, one of which every per-
son connected with the college has had
a part, and has a right to be proud.
Grinnell is pioneer. We are now go—
ing to be the pioneer in going after an
endowment on such a scale."

Expllllns Use of Money.

Mr. Main then went on with the ex.
planation oi the various uses the
money would be put to. A million
or more is to he used to establish al
balance tund of the resources today
caused by the drop in the purchasing
power of the existing resources. A
million is to be used to keep “1) the
educational standards created in the
past, for salaries of professors and
general equipment.

The building program, which Mr.
Main characterized as most important
0! all, would mire the remaining mil-,
lion. Under this program a new men's
union would be one of the ﬁrst im—
movements: as B memorial m Grinnell
men tollen in the war. One of the
ideals expressed by'Mr. Main was the
hope that Crlnnell could expand the
'men's college to about 300 men and
have about ﬁve or six hundred Women
in the Quadrangle, Fifteen hundred
was the number set for Grinneli to
strive for.

New Gym PlunneiL

In addition to the men's union would
be a new gymnasium, new science
buildings. and a new ﬁne arts build-
ing, All these have been planned for
with special places on the campus re—v
served for them. ‘

In closing, Mr. Main emphasized the‘
desperate need oi crinnell for funds.
He picturcd Grinnell as on the turning
point, ready to meet the new demands,
but without funds. His appeal was
for cooperation, and best eflorts of
the alumni to aid the campaign as di-
rected from tho Griunell ofiices.

The next speaker on the program
was J. F. Dccms, candidate for the
Republican nomination for governor
of Iowa, and newly elected trustee of
the college. Mr. Deems praised the
cause of education and praised Presi-
dent Main as a worker, not a talker.
Too much talking in America, and too
little hard work was his explanation
of the slowness of operation of some
parts of the government. He cone
gratulated Grinncll on having one at
her head who is on the job. ,

lngirrrm Makes Appeal.

Harvey Ingham, editor of the Des
Molncs Register, was then introduced.
and upheld Mr. Deems‘ statements
that the corner stone of civilization is

the public school. He appealed to
every friend of the college to take a
stand squarely behind the drive and
see it through. He was followed by
Mr. Cattell, who began by telling some
Personal experiences of many of his
friends of the class of '51 who hap-
pened to be present at the banquet.
These remarks were followed by it
hot speech calling for the support of

to be undertaken. In explaining the
dire necessisty for funds, he went so
far as to say that unless the campaign
proved successful, it was very prob-
able that the alma mater may be lost
to those present.

The cmpalgn is to start immediately.
Withlhead offices in Grinnell, and with
Mr. Main, as president of the college
at the active head. All work is to be
done by the college people, with a
special publicity staff to take care of
that end of the program. It is prob
able that speakers of national note
may be brought to Iowa in connection
with the campaign. Special funds,
not to be taken from the endowment
have been allotted for the carrying on
at the campaign,

' the endowment fund.

iﬂRD DUNSANY WILL
[ERTURE HERE SUUN

Noted Irish Author- Playwright
To Give Address Here on
November 17.

Lord Dunsany, famous Irish play—
wright and author of “Tales Of War,”
a collection of thil‘tyrtwo sketches of
llife in the trenches, has been secured
by the lecture course committee to
give an address in Grinneli Novem-
ber 17. 1

As not only a dramatic critic and a
student of internah‘onai reputation. but
also as a soldier who fought and Was
wounded in the Great War. Imrd Dun-
sany has already aroused much inter-—
est. Critics say that Dnnsany excels
as a writer of prose :cntasies and as
the interpreter of the “romance of the
Vague orient.”

"Lord Dunsany is the only worthy
successor to Yeats in the history of
the Irish theater up to the present,
for he alone has broken with the tra—
dition of peasant drama and has Writ»
ten plays where poetry is not con—
cealed by the fact that his medium is
prose." This is the tribute given him
by the critic of the New York World
recently.

Lord Dunsany began his tour with a
maximum‘ot ﬁfteen engagements, but
on account of his wide popularity was
forced to extend his program so that
his appearance in Grinnell will ho his
sixteenth in this country.

His best known work,
War” has been placed. on the reserve
shelf of the college library. Prof.
Geo. R. Coffman will give a lecture
on Dunsany and his works Friday, No-
vember 14.

Lord Dunsany will be especially re—
membered as the author of "Gods Of
The Mountain", the one—act play which
was given here by the Poltmanteau
players two years ago.

Conard for Reforms
In Classiﬁcation

structors, Professor H. S. Conard pub»

Professor Collard believes that the
discrepancies in the present system
are sufficient to Warrant a. better and
more cfficient classiﬁcation.

HEBUTTAL WINS mi
FORUM m MERRILL

Affirmative Wins Argument Over
Question of Conduct of Pa—
litical Parties,

WINNERS DEFEND STAND l
OF DEMOCRATS 0N TREATY,

Forum's affirmative debate team
won the Merrill debate prize or $120
Wednesday from Institutes negative
team by a decision or three to two.
Tile uuestion was “Resolved: that the
conduct or the Democratic party with
respect to the Treaty of Peace is
more commendable than that of the
Republican party. "

Define Conduct.

John Bartlett opened the argument
for the affirmative with a dehnition
of the term conduct and led the argu-
ment to a discussion of the League
of Nations. Mason Ladd followed for
the negative with a clear and well
constructed speech. He outlined the
opposition of the Republicans to the
League and pointed out that the Re-
publicans were acting for. the good of
the country.

Charles Minty gave the second
speech for the affirmative. His
thought was clear and strong, but he
plainly showed the lock or time spent
on the speech.

llarwoll Herriott answer-ed him with
,a iurther discussion of the motives
’oi the Republican leaders in stand—
ing for amendments to the League.

Kelly Uses Humor.

Joe Kelly, the third speaker for
Forum, trade the most influential talk
of the evening. He opened his con-
strllctive speech with a short rebuttal
revealing inconsistencies in the nega-
tive argument His talk varied from
the usual dry debate speech, by sllowr
ing bits of humor and several times
drew laughter from the audience.

Linn Smith ﬁnished the construct—
ive argument for the negative with a
decisive ararig'nment of the policy
shown by President Wilson in trying
to force the league upon this country.

Rebuttals Strong.

In the rebuttal arguments. the
ispeeches of smith and Kelley were
lespecially strong, although the other
speakers made telling hits. In gen~
oral, institutes team showed more
careful preparation and thought upon
the ‘question, while Forum's strength
lay in their skill in ﬁnding weak
points in the negative argument. The
constructive part of the debate was
easily won by Institute, although For-
um made a brilliant showing in Keir
'ly’s speech. But in the rchutian, the
negative team seemed unable to get
under way.

The judges were Prof. H. w. Norris.
Prof. H. s. Conard, Prof. D. F. Grass,
Prof. J. P. Stoops and Prof. E. D.
Strong. Prof. J. P. Ryan acted as
chairman.

Next year's Merrill rebate will be
between Forum and Chrestcmathia.

BﬂXlNG MATRHES ARE
FEATURE 0F RARNIVAL

Chinese Shuttle-cock And Miri-
strels Add to Entertainment—
Higley Wrestles With Clark.

Boxing. wrestling. vaudeville and
Deb combined to give the men of Grin-
ncll the thrills of the season Friday
night in the auditorium of alumni reci-
tation hall. Very nearly ever-y man
jack was on hand.

Outside of the pep which permeated
the program from beginning to end
the three boxing bouts which were
staged were the hit oi the occasion.
Forbes—Lumen, Smith—lierr-iot, sun!
mons—Wassenar were the hstic enter--
tainers.

In the ﬁrst battle staged between
Forbes and Lumen, Forbes took the
ﬁrst round but was forced to divide
the honors or a draw with his lighterl
opponent in the second.

Smith and Herriott displayed more
art than action. They split the two
rounds between them.

Split blood seemed imminent when
heavyweights Simmons and Wassenar
started on the two-round trip. Whether
by luck or good judgment both man»

other and taught both rounds to a
draw.

Tile wrestling match between Hig-
lcy and Lorraine Clair was probably
the best event of the evening from al
technical standpoint. It took Clark
ten minutes of fast work to throw his
lighter opponent.

A novel exhibition of the ancient
sport of shuttlercock was given by
P. s, Kao. This game consists of
keeping a feathered weight in the air
