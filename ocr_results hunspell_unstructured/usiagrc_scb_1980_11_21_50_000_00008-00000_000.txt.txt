High schoolers don’t know C0116.

by Richard ieichmger

For Grinnell High School kids the fact
is plain and simple: they don’t really
know a lot about what goes on at the cola
lege and they don’t really want to know.

It is generally felt that tension exisLs
between the college and high school
students, but it appears to be based on
misconceptions held by both parties
concerned. So we at the 5&3 decided to
sit down and talk to some Grinnell High
School studens to ﬁnd out what their
real ieelings were towards the college
and its students. ‘

Grinnell High School (GHS) is
located about a mile west oi the college
campus on 8th Avenue. it is a school
made up of sophomores, juniors, and
seniors and has an enrollment of just
over 500 students. The students We talk-
ed to were picked at random out at a
Friday aiternoon study hall. We talked
to two boys, sophomore Scott Lebeck
and junior Rod Schneider, and two
girls, junior Kayla Hovenden and
senior Mary Boyd.

All four .Of the students stated that the
contact that they had with any college
students was limited. Some, like
Lebeck, had played in pick-up basket-
ball games with college students at the
PEC, and some like Hovenden and
Boyd had met college students through
church. All mentioned that at one lime
or another they had come over to the
campus to watch a ioothall game, But,
as Hovenden explained, hecause of the
age diiierence there isn't much oppors
[unity for them to meet college students
on any kind oi social level. especially
because the college kids are oi legal
drinking age and die GHS kids are not.

After talking with the students it
became eVident that their general im-
pressions oi "the college" and the
students were quite varied and mostly
not positive. What were their general
impressions oi Grinllell College
Students?

Schneider explained that he always
sees college students walking and "can
rying lots or books." Boyd explained
that she felt that “they seem really in-
telligent, but have no common sense."
Lebeck said that he felt that college
students "gel. away with a lot that we
don‘t." The general consensus was that
they felt that the college students do not
“respect" them and were always "acs
ting high and mighty." -

Four Grinnell High School students talk about lhei/ impressmns of col
ore Rod Schneider, Scott iebeck, Kayla Hovenden, and Mary Boyd.

It was interesting to note what the
GHS students thought the college
students thought of them, Most
everyone agreed with Hovenden when
she said, "I know that they think we‘re
bad."

Another interesting response came
when they were questioned about the
acts of vandalism and abuse on the col-
lege campus that the high school
students are credited With committing.
They explained that they considered
pranks such as throwing eggs and
tomatoes at students, setting oil iii-e exs
tinguishers, and verbal abuse iroin
passing cars as not being very serious.
But they did admit that "when you try
to run one down," as one oi them called
the practice oi a driver faking like he is
trying to hit somebody walking across
the street. "that's more serious.“

They went on to say that they lelt that
very little major vandalism lbreaking

windows and lightpoles, etc» was causs
ed by GHS students. and that it it was. ll
was done by the same small group at
people over and over again.

The students also stressed that all 01
the abuse was not just given out. but
also received. Boyd explained that GHS
students very otten have to deal with
"smart remarks" irom college
students when they are passing by in a
car or walking downtown,

Another point that came out during
the interview was that (His students
feel that the college students are mere-
1y visitors in their town. "We have to
live here all year round and take care oi
our town, why should they lcollege
studenisi be able to do whatever they
wanl‘." Hovenden slated “They may
be old, but they can't tell us what to
do." Then. aiter reflecting ior a mo-
ment she continued, "ln a sense it's
really both oi ours. We should be able to
