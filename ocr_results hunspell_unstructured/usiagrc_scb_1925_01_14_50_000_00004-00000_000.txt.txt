Once again uc feel we are living in
the same world with you but it has
been two wcclf‘s stnce. we hate heard
from any place farther than

Tsinan (no mile southl. put. at th

ling and this morning's mail brought
papers trout Tiellt. n. it has been
an interesting hut not at all exciting
experience. with the exception of para
haps two days when th ~were (ll, ing
trenches o miles north oi here and
we ~nected to turn the compound in
to a place of refuge for the women and
children of Techow and the hospital
into the “first base hospital" for some
generals wounded soldiers. We even
rode down to the trenches by moon-
light because we expected thorn to he
used the following day in a bloody en-
counter between the Shantung troops
“ho were guarding the arsenal here
and the deserters from the north or
Wu Pei Tu himseli. This uncertain-
ty shows just how little true news we
were able to get.

nut the re-establishmeut of coin-
munieation by telegraph and rail with
Tientsin (250 miles north or us) will
bring us mail, papers and foreign food
so we feel quite at rest again. Trains
are not running on the pre war sche-
dule t, nor are they running through
to honking and Shanghai. We are
thanktul, however, for small favors.

awa y

heiore going on with present events
l heleve 1 will tell you t st or the
annual Provincial Track meet at Tsin—
anfu. October 10, in which WE entered
a basketball team and a track team
and around the preparations for
which most all my energy was ex-
pended during my first five weeks
here. Perhaps i didn't mention her
fore (I’m a bit hashiul about it) hut
I’m athletic director here for the 174
boys. Right away 1 want to add that
our track team got third place with
just onerhalt' point less than the team
that set second place and our basket
hall team got second with nine teams
competing. Don't blame me for the
success.

The affair was the culmination of
weeks and weeks of practice on the
part of the boys for they had worked
at it last spring too. We started in
at once this fall and worked six nights
a week. I got one of the other teachers
to help with the basketball two nights
a week while I took the regular athe
letic work. Then I divided my time

l tool: it inert to enter in the two
parts of the mom. Twenty-mine others
went along to root [or the. team and
when i got this last news ] asked for
another teacher to assist or the re
ponsihilitr, especially since my Clue
nose was even more “llillil” then than
now.

Our train was to lea , at 4:30 F.
We dismissed school e. so as to
hate a pen meeting and to allow the
boys to take the teams to the gate of
the compound We had y , ls and the
Porter song in parting much as we
used to do in Grinuell.

But that is about as far as the sim-
ilarity can he carried!

One big question was food. Of
course we traveled third with such a
motley crew as that. All the boys
had to carry their bed rolls. as is the
custom in china, for they were to
sleep in the University buildings at
Tsinanftt. Then i had two coolics
carry the track stnrf for me 1 my-
sclf carried the money hut if on \till
remember that everything he e is done
with silver dollars or coppcrs toy—
change was 240 copper-s to the dollar-
the day we started and 245 while we
were there and 251 when we returned»
you may know that I had no small
weight.

Although we had order
Tientsin for special rates it took 52:4
ruinntes to attempt to explain this to
the ticket agent sufiiciently to make
him understand that we wanted round
trip tickets at a reduced rate. I must
say he was polite, however, for while
the boys haggled with the vendors on
the platform I sat in a cushioned chair-
in the railway agent's private office
and drank tea while the Chinese teach-
er struggled with the ticket agent.
The train was in before it was settled.
As a special favor to us they were so-
ing to try to get a car for us to have
to ourselves (we could almost fill it).
it turned out that the car was a box
car sort of afrair with no seats, four
windows, no lights and NO SPRINGS.
After a mad struggle i got all the boys
in and the two goats we were trans-
porting for one of the teachers, all the
bed rolls. athletic equipment, and
some food we were carrying. The
Food included four dozen raw eggs

boys parked in the Physics huildin:
where they were to sleep. Sleeping on
the floor doesn't sound just the best
sort of thing for track men but you
must remember that the Chinese sleep
on a prick floor or on a hard wooden
had made of a few boards stretched
over two horses. They insisted that
they must have more food, even at
