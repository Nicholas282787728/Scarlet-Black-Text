The new ecpnprnenr is expected to bring

“The big issue is alcohol, wherher
or nor co serve it," said Lisa Marys,
Direcror ofssudcnsAcriviries, who as.
rended rhe CSL messing. she said rhar
the Harris cc’ntér ’was built partly to
get srudcnr parries our of all rhc
lounges, legally and rormally. How-
ever, Gardner Loungc sriil appeals so
ssudcnrs for smaller bands shar arsracs
a smaller venue.

For rhc frrss Gardner coneerr since
rhe updarc, rhis weekend, glass and
cans won’t be allowed, and share will
be no keg. “This is nor so say rhas
rhere will never be any alcohol,” said
Petzr I<laersch ‘99 SGA presidcnr.

Rarhcr, he described, SGAwiII see
how is goes and make insure changes
as needed. cups from Bob’s and orher
places will be allowed. SGA All Cam.
pus Events (ACE) securisy will also be
presenr,

The CSL also decided ro have
muting: every other Monday at noon,
which are meerings open for srudenrs
to arrend. The CSL is one of several
commirrees shac reporrs to rhe SGA
joint board.

The members of she CSL include
Klaersch, rwa SGA senarors, ﬁve seu.
denrs or large, a couple fac'ulry mem.
bers, and four adminlscrarive ofﬁcers.

The CSL handles a wide vasicsy of
issues so do wirh srudenr life as
Grinnell. Past issues include smoking
on campus and discussions abour she
adequacy or she Mcncal Healrh scr.
vices available so scudenrs.

Marys added that ousdoor con.
eerrs, vandalism issues, haskeeball
games, and barhrooms are all issues
rhar have come under rhe ascension of
she CSL. "CSL looks ar diiferens sides
or she issue and rhen makes a recum—
