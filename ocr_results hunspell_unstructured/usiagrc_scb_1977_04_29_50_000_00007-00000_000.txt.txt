of class

Maurice Hunt’s boyhood dream
‘gdidn’t differ much from that of
' many young boys. “I've always
had a dream since I first put on a
uniform in the eighth grade,"
commented Hunt while taking a
drag on a cigarette. “First, to play
pro football . . . and second. to be a
head coach.”

That dream has been realized as
Hunt leaves today to assume duties
as head football coach at Central
State University of Ohio. Located
in Wilberforce, the predominantly
black school of 2,500 students
competes as an independent in

‘QDivision ll (Grinnell is in Division
III).

In explaining his reasons for

leaving Hunt stated, “It was a

' realization on my part that this is

’ as far as I can go . . after eight

years I wasn’t movu-ig anywhere

. . . Professionally, I’m ambitious

enough thatl felt that I should have

been higher in professorial
status."

”To be honest. it‘s not that the
town was bad Michael (Maurice
and Mary Hunt’s threeryear-old
son) was growing up without any
black friends . . it was a false
world for him . My relationship
with people in town has been
fantastic andl've enjoyed it. . . It’s
been an education for me and for
hem. I have no regrets about
staying in Grinnell for eight
years."

Though best known for coaching
the wrestling and track teams,
Hunt has also served in the ad»
missions department and as an
administrative assistant. If he has
a sore point about his relationship
with the college it has been his
fluctuating status. About the
college's commitment to athletics

ye commented, “If an interest is
taken by the college to help the
athletic program, both ﬁnancially
and in getting athletes, Grinnell
‘ ‘ollege could become very

 

competitive within the conference
and not lose the primary goal of
education. We must come to grips
with the fact that we have student
interest in athletics and should
provide for that interest.”

Mo knew that he would be
leaving the college early this year
and “I have kind of divorced
myself from the political stuff . . .
Grinnell College. under new ad-
ministration is finding its way . . .

Hunt credits his parents for
guiding him in the right direction.
Both were athletes themselves and
“I didn‘t see sports as a way out of
the ghetto . maybe it was a false
world, but I didn't think we lived in
a ghetto. ” He does note that sports
did keep him from becoming in-
volved in East Chicago, Indiana
gang activity.

After leaving Kentucky State
University, Hunt was contacted by
the Kansas City Chiefs and San
Diego Chargers football teams.
Because he weighed only 163 at the
time this frame now handles 200
lbs. quite well) he decided against
pro ball and turned to coaching.

“Grinnell has given me a good
education, I came here as a 25 year
old . . . inexperienced and inept to
deal with the Grinnell philosophy
. . . I‘ve grown considerably,”
reflected the 33»yearrold Hunt.
”I’m happiest on the field, in the
wrestling room or at the track;
that's my bag, I know that . . I
play no role of super sophisticate.
I'm M0 Hunt and that‘s me," he
added.

Hunt is also a black man and
“central Iowa is not the most at-
tractive place for blacks to come.
People in town are now more
receptive than when I first came
. . . Unlike some black facultyI was
married when I came. With a
single black in a predominantly
white community you keep them
for a While but not for long."

For Hunt his relationship with
his son is most important and the
environment in Wilberforce will be
more amenable for a growing
black child. ”We're extremely
close, closer than you would expect
with a child of three."

About his future Hunt stated.
“I’m going up. Competition never
frightens me. I stay loose and do
the best I can . I‘m going to do
my job . . be rewarded for doing
my job. Listen, you take the bitter
with the sweet. I tell my athletes,
you get knocked down. get right
back up."

Mo Hunt is one of the most ar-
ticulate and straightforward
coaches around. Grinnell will
suffer from his absence. In
dealings with both athletes and
non-athletes one word describes
his manner: class.

Improvemen .
but no victory

by Minje Martinez
and Cathy Gillis

in the last few weeks Grinnell’s
women‘s softball team has shown
great improvement in both their
hitting and fielding. In last
Saturday’s game at Cedar Rapids.
the Grinnell women played their
finest game against a superior
team from Mt, Mercy College.
Coach Cindy Winkler was pleased
with their overall team per»
formance and complimented them
on their spirit.

Last Tuesday the women faced
Cornell in a doubleheader at
Merrill Park and were edged out
11-9 and 13-15. Although the Women
seem to be caught up in the current
Grinnell losing syndrome, they
have made great progress since
their opening game and are
exhibiting much more
aggressiveness in their playing
techniques. They hope to return
victorious next week when they
play their final doubleheader May
6 against Upper Iowa.

Pioneers
split

by Peter Lch

Last Saturday, the Pioneer
baseball team split a
doubleheader, M; and 2-1. A large
crowd watched as Grinnell played

its first two home games of the
season.

After losing the lead early in the
first game, Grinnell struck back,
but with too little, too late. Ins
spirationai hits like Jeff Line
dholm’s, which drove in Kurt
Kohlman. were just not enough due
to me voluminous amount of
Pioneer errors in the field. As Don
Petrich’s pitches were sprayed all
over the field, Coach John Pfitsch
relieved him with Chris Sodoma.
Sodoma managed to strike out
some of his adversaries, but
despite his effectiveness Cornell
scored a few more runs and won
the game 8-4.

The Pioneers recovered their
poise for the second game and
skillfully defeated Cornell 271. Tom
Richmond pitched masterfully for
his second win, allowing four hits
and striking out fourteen. Un»
fortunately one of the hits allowed
by Richmond landed over the left
field fence, The lucky opponent
confided that he felt as though the
ball had hit his bat rather than the
hat hitting the ball. Paul Crane
played well in both games. stop-
ping many stray pitches. The in-
field and outfield play improved ill
the second game.

Cornell scored first on the home
run, but Grinnell promptly struck
back. Richmond got a walk and
Paul DeLaney followed with a two-
run homer to win the game, The
Pioneers’ next game is today on
North Diamond against Simpson.

Tennis team or
chorus lme?

by Jim Strickler

They may have finished second
on the courts, but the Grinnell
College ”No Balls at All" chorus
clearly dominated the en-
tertainment competition at the
Wartburg Tennis Invitational, held
last Friday and Saturday.

Last Tuesday, the team played
Cornell on the Grinnell courts.
Against a slightly different lineup
than faced them at Wartburg,
Grinnell won 6-3.

Dan Edwards led ﬂ’le team on the
tennis court last Friday and
Saturday, winning all five of his
singles and teaming with Carter
Newton to win all five of their
doubles matches. Coe won the
meet with 37 points, followed
closely by Grinnell with 32 points,
with Central (17), Cornell (l7),
Luther (15). and Wartburg (10)
trailing. Coach Art Peterson ex»
pressed guarded pleasure at the

team's performance. “We did
almost as well as we hoped to do. I
think some of the players are
smrting to relax better on the
court, and are starting to play
closer to their potential."

But at Friday evenings banquet,
where each team was to provide
ten minutes of entertainment, the
team unveiled abilities that even
Coach Peterson probably had not
dreamed that it had. After an in-
troduction by Joe Topper, and a
dedication of the performance to
all the other teams that refused to
perform, Grinnell’s hottest new
musical group sang a rousing
rendition of “N0 Balls at All." with
a solo by Kent Christian,

This weekend, the team travels
to Illinois. to play Knox and
Monmouth. and to sing another
rendition of “No Balls at All" for
the unwary opponents.

Women’s track
pushes on

by Sue Henken

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
women's track team participated
in the Drake Invitational along
with eight other teams. Although
they tried their best, the Grin-
nellians' performances did not
match the calibre of their op-
ponents.

One bright spot was Kim
Krutilla’s record-breaking long
jump at ls'mvi”. Though not far
enough to place, it was her best
jump ever. in the 220 yd. dash,
Krutilla also had a respectable
time and a commendable per
formance although she again did
not place.

Janice Tave also ran a personal
best in the 880 yd. run. Her time of
2:31.13 was not fast enough to get
Grinnell some points, but was
highly respectable.

The second meet, held on Skip

Day Wednesday, was the Central
Invitational. Up against seven
teams and tough competition, the
women again went scoreless. This
meet consisted of meter~
measured events. Anne Six did
extremely well, running the 1500
meter (approximately 1 mile) in
5:50.B. Two other long distancers,
Adrienne Von Glatz and Helen
Randall. ran the 3000 meter events
in 12:34.3 and 12:46.7 respectively.
Their times were not fast enough to
help Grinnell score but deserve
recognition.

There are two meets left in the
women’s track season, the state
meet on May 3 and the Graceland
Invitational on May 7. Although the
team's morale has been lowered by
these two depressing losses. the
women are hoping to wind up the
season with some success.

Golf team travels to
two more tourneys

by Bob Meyer

This past Saturday the Grinnell
golf team piled into the school vans
for yet another tournament. This
time, they traveled to the lowa
State “B” team’s course in Ames,
Iowa.

Narrow fairways, wooded areas
and other obstacles troubled
Pioneer golfers. Grinnell finished
third in the four-team tournament.
Iowa State was the victor and
Simpson edged Grinnell by nine
strokes. Central College’s “B,"
team finished far behind everyone.

Grinnell‘s best score was a
disappointing 12 over par on the
par 71 course. Only the top four
rounds in the team score were
totaled Grinnell’s totals read:
Dave Vanderpool, 83; Mike

Hopkins, 84; Steve Mayer, 85; Phil
Gutman, 83; Kevin Rackstraw, Ell;
Larry Callison, 95; and David
Harmon, 95.

This Wednesday Grinnell began
competition in the Drake Relays
Tournament. Grinnell and Mon-
mouth were the only small colleges
competing. Many state univer-
sities compete in this annual event.

This three-day tournament at
tracts some of the linast Midr
western amateur golfers. Fine
gifts, such as free watches to the
ten lowest scoring golfers, entice
golfers from all states bordering
Iowa. Grinnell, who finished a
distant last place last year, is not
expected to finish among the
leaders.
