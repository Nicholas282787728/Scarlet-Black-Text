it's a different story, and Bradley is
trying to offer Democratic voters an
alternative to Gore,

"It's a tremendous exhilaration to
think about leading this country at

dley said. “We’re in the midst oftrer
mendous change,"

Someone once asked him what hc

like that, glvclr the fact that Bradley‘s

about it. he said, and did come up with
some answers.

“And that means we‘re going to have

phenomenon ofchrldrcn having chili

“And it also means that we're going
to have to face up to the need for racial
understanding in America,"

Getting to know America

Bradley said his 18 years in the
Senate and his carcerin business have

getting “to know the country, have a
root for the country." And it’s also

One ofthc ﬁrst qtrestions asked of
Bradley Saturday had to do with the
current crisis in Kosovo ~a question
posed by a college faculty member
who said she is a Serbian-American
who feels reporting on the crisis has
been onosidcd and ignores the hiss
torreal context ofthc conflict.

Bradley was critical of what he
called “a number of things that have
already happened that, in my view,
shouldn‘t have happened.”

"I think it‘s importanttlrat we sepa»

said. “But my personal vrew rs the

Recognition of Croatia

The Bush Administration erred
Bradley said, when it backed Ger
many‘s decision to recognize Croatl
as an independent nation.

“That was the beginning ofthe un
raveling of what had been Yu
goslavia,” he said.

But the Clinton policy also has beer
flawed, Bradley added.

“When wedeployedforceto Bosui
in 1996, the president said they'd b
there three or four months and they‘r
be out,” he said, “Three years late
we‘re still there.”

And the objectives of current pol
icy aren’t clear, Bradley remarked.

“Whatare ourob]ecttves7"he asket
“To prevent ethnic cleansing? Well
