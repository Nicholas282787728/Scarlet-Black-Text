Opera Workshop 'Deliglttful’

by William Conner

Last weekend the Opera Workshop

perlormed a charming colage oi
opera scenes directed by James
Fudge with David Montgomery as
musical director, in addition, six
dancers perlormed Lanner's Doro-
bacherl'ander directed by Babe
Voertman,

The program opened with Gian-
Carlo Menotti’s “The Telephone.”
Susan Cavanaugh and Gary Koch
played the two roles in the one act
opera. The story oi the irustrating
attempts of a young suitor to pro-
pose to his beloved was well done
by both performers,

Miss Cavanaugh sang quite well and
her handling of the scenes with the
telephone was excellent. Her ex-
pressions and gestures were de-
lightiul. Koch had a particularly
difficult role in that he needed to
occupy himsell during Miss Cava-
naugh’s lengthy arias. iiis actions
and gestures were very appropriate.
Koch's singing was good, and he
played his role or the lrustrated
lover well. The pair complemented
each other in a delightlul perr
iormance or a run opera.

Fan Tutti

An aria and duet from Mozart's
”Cosi Fan Tutti" followed “The
Telephone.” The story oi a maid
enticing her engaged mistresses
into a bit of fun was welldoneby the
three perlormers. Nada Mangialetti
played the maid, Julie Layer and
Christine iiumy played the young
high-born ladies. Miss Mangialetti‘s
suggestive aria was well done, and

Pakistan Needs
SAGA Fast Funds

To the Editors:

One of the worst disasters of his-
tory is being played out in East
Pakistan and Northern India today.
Up to 8.5 million Bengla Desh retu-
gees have deluged the Calcutta area,
neeing lirst a tidal wave, then a
brutal religious and civil war, and
now lamina. But famine and disease
have followed them to India. From
3040,000 more reiugees are now
ﬂeeing to India daily.

You, the Grinnell College commun—
ity, will have a chance to help these
Pakistan relugees, A lund raising
campaign will begin this week, with
two basic thrusts:

1.) donations for aid to the refugees
will be taken this week, Tuesday
through Saturday, in the lunch
lines. You can also leave your
donations in containers placedin
the post ultice, book store, li-
brary and forum.

2.) on Wednesday, December 8,
during dinner, a fast will be held,
Saga will donate 51C tor every
Student who agrees to skip din—
ner in the dining hall by signing
up (with name and number) with
his S.A. ahead of time. The pros
ceeds irom the last will also go
to Pakistani relugee work.

To supplement this, the initiative
Fund will contribute an amount equal
to 1/2 the total amount collected
through contributions and the last.

Please realize that there isagreat
need among Pakistani refugees, and
what you give can save their lives.
please participate in the drive and
last.

representing concerned students

the silent responses at her em-
ployers was equally as good. Miss
Layer played the outwardly prudish
lady who really wanted to indulge,
and Miss l-iumy played the ilirty
sister who obviously could not wait.
The scene ended in the charming
duet where the ladies planned their
little escapade. The periormance
was good, but minor problems oi
coordination existed.

Splendid Job

Bizet's Quintet from "Carmen”
concluded the first hall of the pro-
gram. Nada Mangialetti played Car-
men, the gypsy girlawaitlng her new
lover, and Christine Middieiort,
Jaye Hamilton, Jerome Collins, and
Kerry Middleton played the roles of
tour gypsy lriends, The group dis-
played the spirit or the piece well,
and did a splendid i The severe
tempo caused some al dillicul-
ties in precision, but they were soon
overcome,

The Dornbacherlander danse
opened the second part at the pres
gram. The three couples, consisting
oi Greg Dickey, Libbie Dietrich,
Terry Layman, Robert Pegram, star
cy Silverstein, and Suzanne Weller
did a good job executing theirdance.
They tailed, however, to Show the
spirit or the piece by seeming too
concerned with their footwork and
not appearing to enioy themselves,
The accompaniement by David Mont-
gomery and Scott Mason was very
good.

Mozart’s one act opera “Bastien
and Bastienne” concluded the evena
ing’s periormance. Diane Deever
and Peter Van Den Honert played

Population

by Bill Knecht
One or the least-mentioned aspects

of the‘pollution crisis in this coun-
try is what someal‘lectionately term
the Population Bomb. That is, the
more people you have, the more
pollution they directly and indirect-
ly cause. '

This ought to be looked at as an in-
disputable tact: more people con—
sume more products and turn out
more garbage in the process. This
takes two lorms: garbage produced
as waste irom direct personal con-
sumption and garbage produced by
factories in the manulactureolconr
snmer goods.

Given a stable standard of living
lor every member of the population,
this has to be the case, and indeed
seems to be what is happening inthis
country, But what does this mean to
us, as members or the population?

Until now, childbearing was an es-
tablished ethic in this country. Eus-
iness thrived by having large, grow—
ing numbers oi consumers. Governv
meat felt secure in knowing that
large populations allow the mains
tenance at large armies to protect
the national security. And there was
plenty or space tor newborn Amerir
cans to move into out West. Thus,
many political, economic and geo-
graphic lactors conspired to sup-
port the idea oi large lamilies as
an ideal.

cc rowtn Now

These days, we realize that our
population cannot continue to grow
indefinitely. When we think of the
environmental problems we have
now, we ought to seriously consider
halting our population growth NOW,
helore we run out 0! space and re-
sources to maintain our already
tenuous balance with the rest of the
environment

The implication this has (or Grins
nell students is that we should set
the example {or others in consider
ing the numbers or children we would
like to breed, and, hopelully, to come
to the sound mathematical conclur
sion that "two is company, three is
a crowd,"

The Motherhood Myth that says
bearing children is the ultimategoal
of womanhood should be rejected by
all thinking women as a male chau-
vinistic, capitalistic plot by persons
whose interest it is to exploit women

the two young lovers, and James
Fudge, Terry Layman, and Greg
Dickey played Colas and his two
attendants. The story oi a ]ealous
girl trying to get herloverback with
the help oi Colas the magician, was a
delightlul periormance

Miss Deever portrayed her solo
opening very well Fudge’s comic
entrance and whole periormance
nearly stole the show. As one any
mirer stated: “He‘s either a great
actor or he has been practicing tor
a long time." Van Den l-lonert
entered last, and he too did a splenr
did job. The lovers' quarrel and
linal reconciliation was dramatia
cally good, and where all three
characters were on stage, the per—
iormance was very exciting. Each
periormer played his character
well. The antics ol the spirits (Co-
las' attendants) added considerably
to the opera.

Lastly, it this reviewer may rely
on his inside knowledge of the per»
inrmance, stage manager Paula
Schwartz should be commended for
her excellent behindrtherscenes
work. Her organization and persi5r
tance in coordinating the 14 people
in the operas was admirable, and
without her they may not have
achieved such a degree olperlection.

Fudge’s and Montgomery’s work in
stage and musical direction was
good, and the end result was a line
periormance.

and their helpless, newborn little
consumers. Men should reject the
Fatherhood Myth in layer or concern
with their environment, which cer-
tainly is a more masculine endeavor
than breeding little Little League
champions.

We should love our children as we
do ourselves. This should meanthat
we Should want them to at least have
the advantages 0! wealth and space
and a clean environment that we did
have as children (or wished we had
had). Realizing that a larger popula—
tion is going to deprive our children

we should dedicate ourselves to the
proposition of “quality rather than
quantity.” This means thetworchild

The Fall Of Summer

by Harlan Smith

After a month of speculation, of»
ficials connrmed yesterday the
rumor that summer had indeed
passed away. Summer died inaiog,
at 1:30 AM, October 18th, alter a
lingering illness. otiicial notilicar
tion was delayed until next at kin
were notilied.

Summer's death ends a month of
speculations, It was learned in late
August that Summer had a terminal
disease, but the disease seemed to
have been latent as Summer con
tinued throughout September. In the
last month, though, little had been
seen oi Summer which prompted
many observers to suspect that it

had leit, or possibly it had suttered
a relapse.

Scientists claim that the death is
attributed to the physicaluniverse...
some absurd reason about the revo-
lution Of the earth around the Sun,
rriends oi the lamily denied this
rumor, saying that a remarkable
increase in the number at iootball
games and the end oi the baseball
season were the chiei iactors tor
bringing the terminal disease out
or dormancy and leading to the rail.

Memorial services were held in
many communities throughout the
Upper Midwest. Many communities
honored the deceased by collecting
the leaves and cremating the re—
mains of our dear friend,

Japan Sees Distorted America

by Ed Debus

When i lelt America in thesummer
of 1970 to participate in the ACM
East Asian Studies program in
Japan, I left a Country that was torn
by war, coniused by racialproblems,
scarred by pollution; in short, a
generally unhappy collection nlpeov
ple without goals or leaders. I es-
caped into a world where space and
time have new meanings, where the
language demands that you see new
relationships between people, where
the debate over the positioning of a
temple stone might have started
centuries before,

I ran into a new set of concerns,
much more personal, much more
immediate, and one hell 01 a lot
more lun.

Since I was living with the Uyedas,
a Japanese lamily living in the
suburbs oi Tokyo, I somehow had to
adjust to their lite—style. My lirst
problem was telling my lamily how
glad I was to be invited to thnthome.

Although my latherand sister spoke
basic English I soon round myself
in a room with my grandmother,
mother and brother with only thank
you, hello, sayonara, and Tokyo Rose
as words in common. I opted ior
hello, and about a week later iinally
lost my typical American attitude
or “why can’t you speak my lang-
uage.”

My family didn’t ask any questions
about America, and I thought origir
nally that they were simply being
politel i realized later that the
Japanese know about us. it is the
American that knows nothing about
the Japanese. Movies and TV shows
lrom America are everywheremave
you ever heard John Wayne say
“drop that gun” in Japanese? The
six o’clock news usually begins with
news 0i America, American pro-
ducts and companys are every-
where, and there are still many
Japanese alive that remember both
the propaganda against America be-
iorc and during the war, and the
occupation that lasted until 1952.

But in spite oi this knowledge,
interest and historical relationship
with America the typical Japanese
views us through distorted ideas.
My Mother seemed to (eel that
everyone in America (except the
blacks whom She thought were the
only poor) had a Doris Day home and
a new Car. She fell apologetic about
her six bedroom home, which she

felt was very small it led me to
ask mysell how she got such dis-
torted impressions and how these
can be changed

Since the American, in the Japanese
view, is aggressive and lmpatientl
did my best to counter that stereo»
type, only to iind outhow aggressive
and impatient I really am, At Expo
'70 the line in front of the Russian
pavillion was six hours long. Whilel
lumed at the long wait, theJapanese
around me got out theirbox lunches,
hunched on the ground and had atwor
h’Jur lunch, Consisting ofbroiled eel,
rice, seaweed, and pear. Nothing
seemed to ruiile their composure,
and acceptance 01 what was, not even
standing in an endless line in the
muggy Japanese summer, while the
American next to them stomps his
loot, and curses the Sun. line, heat,
and time oi day. Around the dinner
table i would totally disrupt the
status system by asking tobeserved
the raw iish that my lather was al-
ways served.

l didn't realize that you didn’t ask
ior anything that wasn‘t served to
you, and that only the head or the
lamily rates such delicacies as raw
fish. To ask (or something that isn’t
there is to suggest that the womenoi
the house weren’t meeting your
needs, which leads me to the next
topic in this series, the position ol
women in Japanese society.
