Vacation policy questioned

By Sharyn Obsatz

Some physical plant em-
ployees believe Grinncll College folr
lows adouble standard. This year. the
day before Christmas Eve falls on a
Monday, so rather than coming into
work for the one day, all employees
have the day off with full pay—all
employees, that IS, except the work»
crs at the physical plant. While the
adminisuation, faculty and support
staff have Doc. 23 off according to it
decislon made by Prmident Pamela

IN THIS ISSUE

Ferguson, physical plant employees
do not have the option of taldng the
day off, even without pay.

Physical plant workers bee
lievc this differential treatment is
unfair. Ferguson and Waldo Walker.
director of the physical plant. argue
that it IS the result of the contract
negotiated between the physical
plant‘s union and the college which
prevents them from granting the em»
ployecs the day off.

harassment

By Steve Clem

Administrators and Jewish stu-
dents are attempting to deal with re~
centreports of antirScmitic symbols
appearing on a Jewish student’s dor—
mitory room door. President Pamela
Ferguson sent a letter to the entire
campus community this week de-
nouncing the actions of the unknown
suspect.

A swastika was drawn on the
student‘s message board on three dif-
ferent occasions last week. Dana
Lehman, Jewish student advisor,
emphasized that the acts wercillegal,
“The acts fall under an Iowa law on
hate crimes. The acts are not only
unacceptable, but also illegal,"
Lehman said. “We took the incidents
very seriously. and an immediate re-
sponse was needed.“

The Jewish student organization.
Chalutzim, immediately planned a
series of responses to the swastikas,
Lehman said that the group immedi—
ately contacted President Ferguson,
which resulted in Ferguson's carn-

allegations

pus-wide memo. The group, with the
cooperation of the Multi~Ethnic Coa-
lition, then formulated a petition de-
nouncing the act. “T he petition was
an excellentshow of community sup-
portfortheiewish students."l.ehman
said.

Chalutzim recently ﬁled a report
with the Anti-Defamation League.
Robert Wolfson. the ADL represen»
tative in the case. believes that the
acts were not only directed at the
individual student and the Jewish
community but to the entire campus,

“The swastika is not only a symbol
of tenor to the Jewish community
alone, but to anyone in the commu-
nity who believes in freedom. The
swastika is the ultimate symbol of
totalitarianism." said Wolfson. “We
are sad that there are still individuals
out there who will commit such acts,"
he added A fourth response of ﬁling
charges with local authorities was
considered. but the student does not
wish to ﬁle such charges at this time.

Committee returns to
evaluate college diversity

By Kim Eckart

Several members of thePresidcnt‘s
Committee for a Stronger Mufti-Eth-
nic Presence (PCSMP) returned to
campus last weekend to evaluate the
college's progress toward a more
multicultural environmenL Although
thepoorweatherconditionsprevenled
the attendance of many committee
members. the rest of the group met
with various campus departments and
organizations.

According to President Pamela
Ferguson, the committee met with
stafffrom the admissions ofﬁce, Stu-
dent Affairs, the Faculty Executive
Council and members of the
Multicultural Task Force and the
Multi-Ethnic Coalition. “One of the
focuses of this semester’s meeting
was the idea of student retention pro-
grams—proactive programs that de-
tcrrninc how students of color are
doing at Grinnell academically and
socially," she said.

Assistant Director of Admissions
Victoria Romero said that the admis-
sions ofﬁce has shown improvement
in student recniiu-nent over the past
three years. This is the second year
that the office has employed two
people devoted specifically to
multicultural admissions. However.
Romero believes that an equally ef-
fective method of studentrecruitrncnt
is the communication between cur»
rent students of color and applicants:

members of several smdentorganiza—
Lion57Concerned Black Students
(CBS),AllStudentslnterestedin Asia
(ASIA) and the StudentOrganization
of Latinos/as (SOL) are all involved
in contacting primary inquiries. ‘The
bcstway wrecruit students of coloris
through other Grinnell students who
know the academic and social expec-
tationsof this environment." she said.
The admissions ofﬁce also finances
the campus visits of those
multicultural students who havebeen
accepted: the ofﬁce stresses the im—
ponanceof these visits, said Romero,
so that students of color can deter-
mine how comfonablc they are with
the Grinnell environment
Overall. the numbers of incom-
ing students of color have increased
over the past three years; the number
of new Latino/a students, forexample.
doubled since last year to 11. Yet
Romero emphasized that more is still
progress to be made in expanding
multicultural enrollment. “The ad-
missions staff works hard in provid-
ing personal attention. I‘m pleased
with the progress, " she said. "I ex-
pect some criticism [for the numbers
of multicultural students], but I just
want to make sure that students who
are admitted here can do the work."
Other faculty members discussed
student retention programs. Dean of
the Faculty Charles Duke noted that
