' Sweep takes Pioneers t0 the top

. byJoeMelinger
Nothing beats those ﬁnal two
weeks ol September when the
pennant races tighten and the
suspense mounts as the teams
battle it out for first place. And how
the fans love it.

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
baseball fans got a taste oi hysteria
as their beloved Pioneers swept a
twinbill from the. shocked Cornell
Rams 15-4, 5-4), and moved into a
three-way tie lor lirst place, With
only two games left to play,
another sweep this Saturday at
Carleton could send the Pioneers
into the post-season playoffs
Needless to say. hysteria ,has also
spread among the team members,
for it has been many moons since a
Pioneer team captured a
doubleheader and ages since they
last found themselves in first
place,

There was no lucky hit, bad Call

by the umpire, outlandish play. or
an sort of help from heaven that
pul ed the Pioneers through on
Saturday. They simply outplayed
Cornell in every aspect ol the
game.

In the first game. led by the
strong pitching. of Kevin
“Stargazer" Starrett. the Pioneers
won in the classic style that the
fans love. Down 4-3 in the bottom of
the ninth Grinnell stageda thrilling
rally. Jimmy Gilbert started the
inning oil with a line single to lett.
With one out. Joe Nixon beat out an
infield hit, sending Gilbert to
second. Joe “Mellow" Melinger
smacked a single to,left, scoring
Gilbert and tying the game at lour
apiece, Then Paul “Iowa Mounr
tain" Crane, after toying With the
pitcher, blasted a shot down the
lelt iield line tor the gamcrwinning
hit, ‘ L '

The glory ol the victory was
dimmed somewhat as the Pioneers
learned oi the possible loss at star
pitcher Starrett for the rest of

the season. During the comeback.
after Melinger had tied the game.
Starrett, in his ecstasy, clumsily

leapt olt the bench to cheer his
teammates on and sprained his

ankle in the process.

Overcome by the pain of the
injury. he had to be carried off the
field. For the next three hours, he
cried, “I hate pain. I hate pain!“
However, it is rumored that
Starrett will bite the bullet and
pitch this Saturday despite his
aversion to pain.

The nightcap proved a carbon
copy of the first game; Grinnell
continued to play superb ball. The
team was led by the fine pitching ol
Charlie Gogel, who kept Cornell at
bay with his “Smoke,” allowing
only live hits and no earned runs.
Grinnell also received line per-
formances from Dave Dunning.
Jeff Lindholm, Ken Bloom, Pete
Nierman, Bill Pickett, Scott
Adams. and Duffer Schultz.

The other Relays
, Drake Relays a treat

by Kevin Koy

Last Weekend in Des Moines.
Grinncll participated in the
prestigious Drake Relays. Running
against many state universities
and some worldrclass athletes. the
Pioneers only entry, the distance
medley relay team oi Kelly
Hanick, Mark Bowman. Dick
Gilbert, and Kevin Koy. finished
near the back of the pack in their
race. However, the weekend
belonged not to Grinnell. Coo, or
Carleton's Dale Kramer but to the
select world-class athletes who
made the meet sparkle.

“But no matter what happens
today, l will be back next year to
break the Relays record,” boomed
Steve' Scott's Voice over the
loudspeakers to a cheering crowd.
Scott, America’s fastest miler, was
apologizing for not running at the
Relays this year. as was
scheduled He had a cold and a
temperature of m degrees.
However. the fans still had hopes of
seeing the lirst sub-four minute
mile in the 69 years of Drake
Relays history,

But the crowd was disappointed
as Niall O'Shaughnessy, an Irish
miler who ranks among the top in
the world, followed a slow early

'nearly

 

pace which ruinedthe possibility oi
a record. His time was 4:014

Hog trailer bests ruggers

by Peter st, Thomas

The Grinnell Grunts ended their
'Season last Weekend at the
prestigious Allrlowa Tournament
which took place in the sedate
setting of Mason City, The trip
began with the setting up of the
Grinnell locker room: a six-man
tent joined later by a 25-foot hog
trailer. Accommodations were dry
but chilly.

The boys in blue took the field at
it am Saturday against the highly
favored Quad Cities Irish. The
town~gowners produced one ol
their finer efforts of the season and
defeated the Irish, 6-4. Howard
McDonough and Dick Hasley
combined for Grinnell's first try in
six contests. The ruggers spent
most of the day on defense,
making their slight six points hold
up.
Two and half hours after their
brilliant upset, the Grunts were
lurced onto the pitch against a
strong Eastern Central squad. No
.’ iacuirs ' contributed ‘ to‘. a heart-
breaking 94! loss fatigue from the

first match and the fact that the
ruggers played both games two
men short. Lack of an offensive
attack was once again Grinnell's
nemesis.

At the close of the first day,
Grinnell was placed seventh of 14
teams, a tact that left most players
with mixed emotions. The final
record for the Grunts was 34;,
which to most would seem
disappointing. but to a team that
lielded an average at two unex-
perienced players a game, the
season was not a total 1055.

Next year. there will be a fall
season for those interested Along
with the learning or a new sport,
the experience will include ad
vanced lent pitching, introduction
to hog trailer sleeping. and in
termediate night practices, All are
events perlected at this year's
tournament ll you have any
questions. direct them to any
rugby player They will not be able
to answer your questions but
they‘re great. conversationalisls
