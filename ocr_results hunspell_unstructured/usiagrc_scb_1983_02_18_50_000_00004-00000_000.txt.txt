Is the joke
on us?

This week Joint Board passed an attendance bylaw regulating the
number of “excused“ and “unexcused" absences allowed by each
representative:

“No Joint Board representative may miss more than three

meetings. One unexcused absence (without substitute) and two ex-

cused absences (with substitutes) is the acceptable breakdown of
the three absences."

Though fine in principle, this bylaw somewhat smacks of babysitting
and of notes from Mom. Granted, absenteeism is a problem at Joint
Board meetings, but passing yet another bylaw concerning parliamen-
tary procedure will hardly eliminate that problem.

This is not to say that such legislation does not serve its purpose, nor
should not have been made. But the necessity for such a measure points
to a larger problem.

Absenteeism could be a symptom of indifference, apathy or boredom
with the meetings. The fact that only five representatives returned
from last semester could signal these feelings, as well as a feeling of
discouragement (or disgust) with the lack of progress Joint Board
makes. Constant revision of procedural rules, causing meetings to be
rather dull and long—winded, will only serve to exacerbate these
phenomena.

The Student Government Association has often been regarded as
something of a joke on campus, viewed essentially as a service bureau
that conveniently provides shuttle buses at breaks.

But who gets the last laugh?

The SGA could play a vital role on campus, taking stands on impor-
tant issues, monitoring campus sentiments and possibly gaining a voice
in nonacademic decisions.

The problem that underlies these deficiencies is the lack of student in-
terest and concern with the SGA.

In most dorms, so few residents show up for the hall elections that
Joint Board attempted to pass a bylaw requiring 20 percent dorm atten»
dance to make an election valid.

As students, we form the SGA’s constituency and are thus an equal,
vital part of the governing (7) process. Our sense of responsibility
should be no less than that of the respresentatives. If we do not choose
to act in such a manner, men we really don’t have the right to deride the
present system and what it can and cannot do.

So now, on the brink of the new SGA cabinet member election, we
should all reconsider the role of the SGA itself and our role in it.

 

The editorial staff of the Scarlet and Black would like to clarify a
point make in last Week's editorial regarding commencement. Eight to
ten seniors a year are not literally pulled out of the procession line,
though a certain number are informed prior to the ceremony that they
may not participate. We did not intend to offend anyone involved with
the commencement proceedings nor to misrepresent the facts; we
apologize if such was the case.

This thing with girls,

it’s painful

What with continual war, contlnual
repression and continual poverty existing
everywhere you might spend spring break
and the transformation of the presidency
into a bad example of prerdepression-era
vaudeville here at home, when the finger
of God inscribes the history of the
Universe in the firmament, the present
furor over Iowa's drinking age probably
won't receive much attention. For Grinnell
students, whose concerns are more local in
focus, the proposed legislation to raise the
state's legal drinking age to 21 years ofage
has multiple implications for the future of
his or her “Grinnell Experience."

The stereotypical image of modern col-
lege students as inveterate supporters of
the nation's breweries is unflattering,
judgmental and accurate. Most college
students drink alcoholic beverages with
reasonable frequency at bars and parties,
or on outings, and many maintain their
own private stocks of beer and/or liquor.
Such behavior amongst undergraduates
occurs in states with 21-yearrold drinking
ages as Well as states without it, a fact that
many Grinnell students may find comforr
ting. With a modicum of wit, ingenuity and
Chutzpah, underaged drinkers should have
no trouble duplicating the conventional
drinking habits of yﬂur average college
student Unfortunately, “typical" and
“conventional" are adjectives Grinnell
students apply to themselves about as
often as they do “leprous” or "unique ”

Precious few college students, for exam-
ple,‘ can conclude a full afternoon of
classes by hastening to a student-owned
Pub located under the school's main dining
hall. Evaluating the Pub and its impor-
tance' to the college community is difficult.
Depending upon a person's outlook, it is a
steady and necessary source of employ-
merit, a squalid dive which encourages
oersonal atrophy or a second home.

Three blanket statements can be made
of the Pub with reasonable certainty: 1) It
is the only expliciuy nonacademic environ-
ment in which students gather exclusively

to sonialize. 2) As such, it is rather p0
with the student body. 3) It will close i

Most students celebrated their 19t

did not find the lack of a Pub membel
a dire inconvenience, Nevertheless,
students welcome the changes in s
behavior that would occur if the Pub

lege, a point for which i argued r'

As with the Pub, 3 number of fa

Response to Editorial ‘Legah'ty’

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter in response to the
article “Legality, the Forgotten
Element," which appeared in last week's
Scarlet and Black. This letter is not design-
ed to defend or justify illegal or immoral
actions, it is rather an attempt to place in
perspective the wide. array of views er
pressed in the aforementioned article.

In regard to concerns stemming from
the smoking of marijuana in the lounges
and hallways of a certain dormitory, I
would be the first to admit that this is a
serious problem. However, a solution was
found in the hall in question when students
simply discussed the issue and decided
that common courtesy be exercised in the
act of smoking pot in the dorm.

Now, some may say, “Boy, those drug-
gies really got away with bloody blue
murder this timel " I think not. If I am not
mistaken, m uana laws are designed to
protect potential users from the effects of
the drug which some consider to be harms
ful. In my opinion, if an individual chooses
to partake in pot smoking, as long as he or
she does not infringe upon the rights of
another individual, it is the smoker's pro-
blem As for the point concerning nonrpot
smokers who “conspire” by not reporting
smokers, I find this ridiculous If I see
somebody speeding (that is 7 driving in
excess of the speed limit on a public
thoroughfare), am I therefore obligated to

pull that person over and make a cit
arrest? Idaresay, no.

On a more serious note, I would li
say that I believe that the students h
Grinnell are, for the most part, in
adults who can work out their differ
in a civilized fashion. I have a great d
respect for the student who raised h
jcctions to potsmoking, and i am gla
he was able to voice his opinion w’
having to worry about harassment
consideration on the part of those stu
opposed to his views.

Last week's article went on to
such henious crimes as fraud, Vand
and serving alcohol to minors. In
these crimes cannot go unnoticed, but
to see Ute connection between thes
tions and smoking marijuana. 0n th.
trary, I find most marijuana users
quite relaxed and free from the te
which may drive people to comm
above crimes.

In closinglwould like to say thatle
is far from forgotten on this cam
believe that students are being
aware of the consequences of their a
all too often, and that articles such
one which was printed only serve
ritate the situation and polarize th
posing sides " The next time I fire
j you can best believe that I will b
sidering legality, the rights of my
students, and the possible dangers l a
posing myself to. — Reg Archamhau
