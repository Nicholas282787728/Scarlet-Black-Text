on that day.

The date of the walkout has
been set for later than in previous
years because of Easter vacations
which would conflict in many
areas with an earlier strike, Lash
said.

military budget has started a
ﬂood of inquiries to us from stu-
dent groups and individuals who
want to register their disapproval
of the war program by joining in
the strike," Lash said.

There are the men students, for

“1 hit the books” because of the
alarming effect the phrase has on
their grades.

Men are far more superstitions
than women, the investigation
shows. and athletes are particular-
ly susceptible. A trackman Tar
ported that he never dared shove
on the day of a race, and would
rather run barefoot than wear any
but the fir-st pair of track shoes
he ever owned.

other athletes rely on a careful
shining of their shoes before a
contest, or a wad of gum stuck on
their equipment somewhere. A

before a game once, he says, and
it cost him a brokchdeg.
