Stassen Lead
In Popularity

In a random sample of com-
pus opinion taken this week by
members of Assistant professor
Charles Homer’s class in public
opinion and morale, 50 per cent
of the 139 students polled tier
clared themselves in favor of
Harold Stassen as nominee for
president in the coming national
elections.

Next highest on the list of
candidates were Dewey, with 13
per cent of the campus vote. and
Taft, with 8 per cent. Wallace
fell below Taft by only one per
cent, wlule Vandenburg and Eis—
enhower pulled 5 and 3 per cent
respectively.

,A factor which may effect thc
validity of the results is the (life
ferential nature of the turnout,
that the group polled actually
may not be the most active
voters.

Campus opinion, stated Mr.
Haner, is also subject to change
during the months before the
campaign.
