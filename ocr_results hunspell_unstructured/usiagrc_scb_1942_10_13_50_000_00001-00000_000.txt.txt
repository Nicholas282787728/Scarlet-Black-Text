Buckley '42 Visils Campus
William D. Buckley, ’42, former
Scarlet and Black editor, visited
the campus Sunday.

Now employed as federal ord-
nance inspector at the Fol-mall
plant in Rock Island, m., he has
recently completed a training
course in Chicago.

Suggestion for a month’s
vacation-for all colleges and
universities was made several
weeks ago in a communica-
tion from railway companies,
in order to eliminate transporta—

tion difficulties during- the holi-
day scason, when both college
students and soldiers will be re-
turning home.

The suggestion called for a re—
rccess oi a month, Doc. 16 to Jan.
16.

Correspondence with Joseph
Eastman, head of the office of
defense transportation for the
federal government revealed that
this plan is not a government ord-
er, but a suggestion of the mile
roads alone, Stevens said.

Several colleges in the United
States have agreed to extend
their vacation, mainly in the he
terests of economy, according to
Stevens.

“Grllmell could save between
three and five.tliousand dollars
if it closed for a month," he
said. “This loss would be ab-
sorbed mainly by the students
themselves, however, since they
have paid for and are cutitled to
get a full years board and room,
not to mention the academic loss
the added two weeks might
cause."

According to Eastman, the na-
tional govcriuneut is not con-
teniplating asking for the exten-
sion.
