One media, under SPARC...

The idea was put fonh last Wednesday at the Student Publications and
Radio Committee (SPARC) meeting that SGA should pass a by»law which
would turn SPARC, which is now a presidential committee, into an SGA
standing committee. Thechange is being suggested on the preth that it will
increase the efficiency and fiscal independence of the campus media.

However, the Scarlet and Black believes that the by»law will fail in this

aim if itis notsubstantially altered from thecurrentdraf L Currently, semester

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Student responds to animal testing article

To the editor.

As an animal tights activist, I am
accustomed to being defensive about
my views. I am defensive because
while I live in a Society which strives
to end racism, sexism, ageism, and
classism,1alsoliveinasocietywhich,
for the most part, whole-heartedly
endorses speciesism — the condom:-
tion of the use and abuse of non—
human animals for the sake of hu-
mans. However, I am not going to
argue thecase foranimalrights. rather
[am going to argue something which
is much more palpable to the major-
ity: the rightofthe individual to live
by her/his personal ethics and the
necessity of the society (the campus.
the department, the professor) to re-
spect that individual’s ethical beliefs
and choices as society is already ex-
pmted to accept an individual’s be-
liefs based on religious tradition.

Professor Debong showed an un-
fortunate lack ofknowledge concern-
ing the majority of students who op-
pose dissection and vivisection. Ac
cording to thereponer, DeLong specur
lated “that the animals used for edu-
cation might not be considered dif-
ferently than those animals used for
food or clothing," and said, with re-
spect to cockroaches, “if you can step
on drain in the hall, what is wrong
with dissecting and learning from
them in the laboratory,“ By making
thesecomments,he seems not to real
ize that most people who hold strong
ethical views with regard to animals

in laboratories, also hold equally
Strongbcliefs regarding Lheconsump—
tion, wearing and even the stepping
upon of insects. Yes, people do actue
ally watch their step, ﬁguratively and
literally, to avoid killing any animal
life.

Furthermore, a lack of respect was
shown for students' ethics. By focus—
ing on the relatively small number of
students per year who question the
use of animals in laboratories, Pro-

Task Force encourages
participation in survey

To the editor,

The following is an open letter to
the Grinnell campus:

Earlier this week all members of
the college community received a
letter inviting their participation in a
campus-wide survey on
multiculturalism at Grinnell. In that
letter, the community was reminded
that Grinnell College has an histori-
cal commitment to social responsL
bility and international education. In
the last two decades, we have ex-
pressed that commitment by scri-
ously addressing the issue of diver-
sity within our student body, our fac-
ulty and staff, our curriculum, and
our student services.

Our progress toward becoming a
multicultural community has been
substantial. President Ferguson sees
the various campus initiatives as
growing naturally from Grinnell's
mission to prepare students to be ac-
tive members of their community.
Clearly, preparation for the 2Ist cen-
tury demands that we deﬁne “com-

munity" as ”world community" and
that Grinnell continue its efforts to
become a multicultural environment.

Thanksgiving is next Thursday
It‘s a holiday I always approach with
a bit of ambivalence. 0n the one
hand,Iloveturkey,I’m fromachicken
farnily.andThanksgiving has always
been my one day to flaunt the over4
whelmingadvantages turkey has over
chicken. More white meat, fewer
bones. better gravy and the fact that
Benjamin Franklin never suggested
that the chicken be our national bird.
That last fact has always made me
wonder how the culturcof theUnited
States might have been affected had
Franklin gotten his way. Perhaps we
wouldn‘t complain so much about
our postal system had it adopted the
turkey as its mascot rather than the
eagle. The expectations ofan organia
zation which identiﬁes itself with a
fat, mostly flightless bird would be
closer to reality.

On the other hand, before the
turkey hasevencooledoff.beforeitis
half-time at the Cowboys‘ football
game, I will inevitably be subjected
to some commercial or news story
remindingmethattheChristmasshop»
ping season has begun.

There are many obnoxious things
in this world: the driver who goes 35
milcs per hour in the passing lane,
Rev. Al Sharpton having a bad day,
JohnSununuhavingagoodonc. None

Josh Ford

are as obnoxious as the Christmas
shopping season.

Operation Desert Shield never
would have turned into a Storm if we
had just kept the sanctions on AND
whipped a little Christmas shopping
season on the Iraqis. Forget satura-
tion bombing. Imagine six straight
weeks of being told 24 hours a day,
that it was time to get in the spirit and
buy, buy, buy that special gift before
limited supplies expired. Not only
would wehaveliberatod Kuwaitwith-
out bloodshed, but thousands of Iraqi
desertcrs would have tied behind
American lines and begged for asy-
lurn, driven mad by the need to buy
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action
figures

Who knows? Maybe instead of
President Bush threatening, “We’ll
kick his ass." he would have warned,
“We’ll send him a fniit caket" Some
fmit cakes aren’t much better than
smart bombs.

Besides the opening of the Christ-
mas shopping scason, Thanksgiving
isalso accompanied by the compuncr
tionto givcthanks.Thisinitselfisnot
abadidea,butnotunlikemosthuman

The irony of Thanksgiving

ventures into the realm ofhumility, it
rings a little false. Let’s face it-
when it comes to most things we‘re
not satisfied with what we have. We
can fool ourselves and say we are. We
can even name stuff like, “I’m thank-
ful for my health and my family.“
Great, most people are. Health and
family deserve their own holiday,
every day in an ideal world would be
an opportunity to give thanks for
health and family.

You would think such thankfuk
ness would linger awhile. We might
remain even momentarily content
with our lot. If we loved our families
and our health that much we might
hang around a day or twojust basking
in the glory.

Instead, at the first opportunity we
rush out into the malls to be squished
together in an American approxima-
tion of how it feels to live in Shang-
hai. If we were truly thankful for all
we have, perhaps there would be a
little pausebetween the two extremes
of humility and consumption.

IhavebeenalittlehardonThanksr
giving, We really should be thankful,
even if we don't mean it. It makes us
realize that things usually aren’t as
bad as politicians and columnists try
to paint them.
