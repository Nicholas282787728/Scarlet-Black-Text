Homecoming and football seem to go together like ham
and eggs. Vl'hy’.7 Where did football pick up tllis strange
prominence in institutions devoted to learning? Perhaps
it harks back to the days when football was big business,
and college was a glorified gymnasium. During the past five
years several events have come to light that indicate this
is still the case ill many colleges and universities across the
country.

' When llatiollal attention was drawn to startling effects
ootball as a big business, the National Collegiate Ath-
Associz ion published a statement disparaging these
el‘fects and adopted a positive code of athletic ethics.
Keyertlieless, sports scholarships and their attendant evils
still go on. Nearly all colleges still playing bigtime sched—
ules are forced into the open market to obtain their raw
material. They have to bid for the best players, and make
concessions to keep them: The fact that such a system rec
dudes the college athlete to a pl'ejllrer, a scalper, and a
, football gigolo is ignored. In the words of Robert Maynard
Hutcliins, “We Americans are the only people in human
history who ever got sports mixed up with higher educa-
tion. No other country looks to its universities as a prime
source of athletic entertainment alld anybody who has
watched, as I have, 12 univel'Slty presidents spend half a
day solemnly discussing the Rose Bowl agreement, or any—
body who has read pol entious discussions of the “decline”
01" Harvard, Yale, Stanford, or Chicago because of the re-
curring klefeats of its football team mllst realize that we
in America are ill a different world."

In view of this, Grinnell can be proud. Athletic scholar—
ships are unlino 'n, and concessions f om the faculty to
athletes concerning grades are noncc istent, as any l'oot-
hall player will tell you. Football is kept ill its proper realm

sport and not a symbol of college lile. Grillnell is noted
for her standards and her SLlldel’ltSr not ['or her athletic

record. This is as it should be.

It wollld be great if the team wins tomorrow. and we
wish them the best of lucli; but to the team. and to the
Homecomers of today and tomorrow. Grinnell and Home-
coming will mean a lot more than a football game.
