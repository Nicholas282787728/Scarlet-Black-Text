Woodard grew up in Alabama and move
ed to St. Louis nearly 20 years ago with his
pregnant wife and three children. without
a penny to his name, he made a vow to help
other hungry people it only God would help
him then.

To redeem that pledge, Woodard now
presides over a combination social service
agency and mission house. He worked as a
janitor at Concordia Seminary during the
day and set up an ad hoc food pantry which
he ran during the evenings and on
weekends. When the theologians found out
about their janitor's aftershours crusade
against hunger, they made his pantry a
program of the Lutheran Family and
Children Services, designating his
storerooms as its North Outreach Office.

They gave Woodard a salary to be its
director. _

with his own savings, he bought an aban-
doned mansion on Bissell Street that
became his base of operations and his
family’s home. His three or four speaking
engagements a week produce most of the
donations on which his work depends.

District of Columbia and chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus. He is chair
man of the board of directors of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference
and vice-president oi the Martin Luther
King Center for Social Change in Atlanta.

in recognition of his record of
humanitarian community service, both
Yale and Virginia Union University have
conferred honorary Doctor of Divinity
degrees upon Fauntroy. Because of his
leadership in bringing voting rights to the

Faculty hesitant on

student facility

by Ron Leinen

Action on the Student Design Inter-
disciplinary Concentration program was
postponed at Monday's faculty meeting
because a quorum majority was not pre:
sent.

Although sympathetic to student needs,
the administration is not ready to recom-
mend construction oi the studentrproposed
student recreation facility. This facility
would be used for movies, parties, dances,
concerts, and other public events. George
Drake said, “We have survived on this
campus with the current concert and park
ing space without great hardship, and it is

The Limit

doesn’t...what have we lost? Nothing is gas
ing to be attractive,,.to all groups,”

Phil Frana, vice-president of the student
advisory committee for the Limit, said a
survey was distributed at the beginning of
the year to help determine whether the
students had an interest in a teen center.
The survey asked students if they thought
Grinnell needed a place for teenagers to
go on the weekends and if they would help
set a center. According to Frana, the
group that works for the Limit “is so
diverse with the 14 who are setting it up..,.
Over half are involved in athletics...
We’ve got some really brilliant kids, and a
lot of people who are just hard workers.”

Melanie Drake, secretary [or the Limit,
said that ”about 90% of the people who
responded liked the idea“ of a teen center.
Drake said that the 14 who now serve on
the committee are an ”innovative group of
students... We had people from each
grade...pick people who represented peo-
ple from each group. We had trouble with
the sophomores, Nobody wanted to
volunteer.”

at least conceivable that there are alter
native places where movies could be
shown on campus.” The administration
plans to weigh all possibilities before
recommending any action. Meanwhile,
Roberts Theatre is being viewed as a
possible site for movies during the ARI-I
renovation, tentatively scheduled for
June, 1988.

The library will receive $80,000 of the
budget to purchase books. As the library
found that 80% to 85% of the books used in
Burling have been published in the last 12
years, the money will be spent mainly on
books ublished in this eriod.

Drake's parents, George and Sue Drake,
were instrumental in organizing the group.
According to George Drake, “all three [of
his children] came up against the problem
oi what to do...especially in the summer.
It’s pretty dead for that age group. My
wife and I decided to help Grinnell
2000 .Iand] we really worked through our
daughter.. . She talked to her friends.”
Another important organizer of me Limit
was Sharp Lannom, according to Drake,
Lannom, ”who is sort of the inspiration
behind Grinnell 2000.” in Drake’s opinion,
helped the kids get started.

The Limit Will receive a $2,000 interest-
free loan for renovations and other costs,
The student organizers are currently can»
vassing the area to raise another $10,000
for the center.- The loan by the Grinnell
2000 Foundation caused some groups in
town to question the fairness of Grinnell
2000. The foundation is a regional
organization; however, die teen center is
strictly a Grinnell project. In response, exr
ecutive director Ben Webb said, “Some of
our projects are strictly Grinnell projece.
However, the kids can bring guests.”

 

Popper

Q: What direction would you like to see
Grinnell take, andln what direction do you
see Grinnell moving in the next 20 years?

A: The board is giving a lot of thought to
what is going to happen today and tomor-
row, I think we‘re giving a lot of thought to
what kinds of students we Want: a very
diverSlfied student body. We’re very ins
terested in having a larger minority group
encompassed in the student body. I think
we want to keep getting better and better. I
think the Louise Noun chair was needed
and will add a different dimension, and a
good one. I think the idea of a Chinese
studies prbgram is excellent, The people
that we’re hiring, especially for the endow-
ed chairs, aren't people that are so
renowned that they'll spend all their time
writing papers and books. I find the new
professors that are being hired to be young
and very involved with the students and I
think that is what Grinnell is all about,

Q: What happens on an average trustee
weekend?

A: This particular meeting we’re
discussing the projected budget of the
coming year, we’re discussing renovations
of different buildings and capital spending

for new building. It’s a full agenda. Later
this afternoon We'll go over to the faculty
house to havea chance to talk. Tonight, the
professor involved with the new exchange
program with China will talk to us alter
dinner, 1 think the trustees take these
meetings very seriously.

Q: _How do you see Grinnell measuring
up to’ other small, liberal-arts schools?

A: Grinnell is a unique experience. I
think it's a diverse student body, and i
think the programs are good. The students
are very thoughtful about the courses that
ﬂiey take, even though some aren't re-
quired. I’m pleased to see that they're tak-
ing more foreign studies 7 the Chinese.
Russian, offrcampus semesters abroad
and in Washington 7 I think that’s wonder-
ful. It’s interesting that occasonally when I
am able to have lunch with the students in
one of the dorms, and I just sit down and
we chat — it‘s funny. ['11 say. “Now tell
me, what are the problems?” And I have
sat there and they’ve said, ”I can’t think of
any.” it's wonderful. »

o: Are the trustees too far removed
from the active life of Grinnell really to get
a sense of what the college and its students
need? _

h: i think that’s always a problem with
any university and i would like, if there
was the time, to attend a lecture, to have
lunch with the students more frequently
than we do. But the problem is that we only
have one and a half days. I would like to
see more informal meetings with students,
not just organized meetings — they’re too
contrived. -

Q: But you do at least receive the Scarlet
and Black every month?

A: I do and I read it and I think it’s very
well done,
