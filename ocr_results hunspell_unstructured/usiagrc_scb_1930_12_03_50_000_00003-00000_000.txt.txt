that his market basket full of food

Smell towns like Grinnell certainly
do ruin one so far as getting around
in the city is concerned. During va-
cation Otto Golz, while making a trip
from evcca to Greenﬁeld, became
lost among the 300 inhabitants of
Adair. If it hadn’t been for the guid-

Speaking of Mr. John Barnum,
the distant relation of the famous

Alumni Defeat
Drakeﬁ to 0

Rose, Wing Lead Grinnell
in Game for Charity;
. Duke Stars

'(Spechll to The Scarlet and Block)
DRAKE STADIUM, DES MOINES—
Old-time Pioneers of Crinnell college
gathered together long enough here
Saturday afternoon to defeat a team
of former Drake stars, 64], in a char-
ity football game. .

Grinnell staged the drive for the
counter late in the third quarter.
when Rose plowed six yards to the
45 yard line just as the whistle blew.
A long forward pass to Wing put the
ball on the 26 yard stripe, and then
on the next play Lamb passed to Mac
lntire for the touchdown. “Mike” Hy—
lnnd. famed scarlet and black coach
of years ago, came in to placekick
the extra point, but his try was wild.

Long Plants Made

It was Crinnell's game from start
to ﬁnish. The Bulldogs were presented
with only one real opportunity to
score, while the Pioneer bnll carriers
muffed repeated chances. The punt-
ing was unusual. Boots of 60 yards
were credited to both teams. McLsin
of Grinnell and Barnes and Crehsugh
of Drake doing the kicking. unlimited
substitutions were made by both
elevens.

Rose and Mclntire of last year's
team proved mainstays of the Crin-
nell backﬁeld, while McL-ain, Wing,
and Lamb also turned in creditable
performances. Duke and Peterson
starred in the line.‘
