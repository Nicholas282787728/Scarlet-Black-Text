'l'urt'r TH concert series, which
proved so Successful last year, has
’ ‘ed to secure enough subscribers to
justify repeating the experiment, is a
matter of regret not only to the mem-
bers of the School of Music, brtt also
to tiie studettt body and town people.
Arrangements had been made so that
a course frilly up to last year’s stand-
ard could have been secured. but it
was necessary that four hundred tick-
ets he sold in advance, in order to in»
sure meeting expenses. The town
was thoroughly canvassed, and, as
only three-fourths of that number
corrld be disposed of, the pIair was
given up. One of the entertain
merits, however, which was most
heartily received last year, and which
was to have been a feature in the 1897
course, will be given, the Spiering
String Quartet. This company ot’
artists needs no recommendation to
the old students who heard them last
year, and those who are at Grinncll
for the ﬁrst titne cart be sure of en-
joying a rare treat it they attend.
The concert will be given ht the Stone
Church, December 3,

THE STATE supreme court has witlr
iii the past week rendered a decision
which will he of considerable interest
to all students and I’riends ot Iowa
College, as it is likely to atiect our
Iinanees to the extent of some thou-
sands of dollars.

It will be remembered that a tetv
years ago a gentleman by the name
of Riecklioﬂ’ lett by will the sum 0|
555,000 to the college. A claim was
tiled against the estate, on certain
grounds, tor $10,000, which the ver»
diet of a jury allorred to the extent
of $5,000. Brit the executor ape
pealed the case to the supreme court,
which reversed it, and the college will
probably receive the full amount of
the bequest.

Yale has begun its 198th year with
