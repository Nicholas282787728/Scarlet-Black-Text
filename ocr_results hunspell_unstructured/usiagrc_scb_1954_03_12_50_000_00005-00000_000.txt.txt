Carls Favored

Carleton. which was second
to Chicago last year, stands
out as the favorite among the
Conference teams. Chicago is
again favored. The Carls will
be strong in the relays, al—
though .penhaps not quite as
strong as last year when they
won -three of the five relays.
in addition they will have Bob
Kirk to defend his 711 yd. low
hurdle title and to shoot at the
record of :oa.o seconds he set
two years ago. Dick Linde-‘
kugel, who placed 4th last
year in the shot, will also be
back. The oumtanding runner
on the team is John McCam-‘
ant, the Conference half—mile,
and cross-country champion,l
who will be an important part
of a couple of relay teams, and
might even run the tweemiile.

this year. Bryan Valett, who
placed 4th in the high hurdles
last year at Chicago, will have
a good chance to finish farther
up this year.

Coach Booth plans to run the
same men who placed fourth
in last week’s North Central
relays. Figured to ‘place high
is the mile relay, the two mile
relay, and the sprint medley

Bud Huesner and Chuck
Westrup will run both hurdle
events for the Pioneers and
Nick Ryan will compete in the

In the individual scoring race,
Jerry Steltel‘, Riyon's hook shot
artist, fell 17 Ipoints short of
tying the 12 game conference
total of 269 posted the week
before by Pete Kovacs, Mon-
mouth guard. Needing 64 points
in his last two games, Stelter
made 25 points against St.
Olaf and 22 against Carleton
to end up with 252. The next
five men are down in- the 211-
to~221 bracket. No one came
close to the record of 315
points set by Lloyd Olmstead
of Cornell last year.

Bob Winter of Grime“, who
was second with 280 last year,
dropped to a fourth place 218.
The scoring was more evenly
divided this year among the
top twenty, the range being
from an average of 22.4 to 12.0.
as against a range of 26.2 to
11.4 last year.
