If just telling people that there is
an energy problem hasnt been
very convincing, then the
economics of energy has begun to
arouse awareness that there is a
problem. The era of cheap energy
is over, and those who reluse to
believe it are nonetheless faced
With the skyrocketing cost of oil,
natural gas, and electricity.

For Grinnell College, the in-
creasing cost of all common
energy forms is a very serious

‘ issue. The college is a large cone
sumer of all three types oi energy
mentioned above. Heating,
cooling, and lighting all dorms,
classrooms, administrative,
physical education, and main-
tenance buildings is an expensive
operation. in addition, substantial
energy is used to operate the food
service and to facilitate ex»
perimentation in the science
building.

FACED WITII RAI’IDLY rising
energy costs, the college must find
ways to reduce energy con
sumption and to seek possibilities
for alternative sources
ol energy lor the future when oil
and gas are less available, or not
available at all,

“our primary motivation is one
of economics.” said Physical Plant
Director Dale l-lawn, nan-n spoke
recently at a special IPIRG
meeting on the topic of energy use
at the college.

.\T THE MEETING, l-lawn add-
ressed the question of what steps

 

 

the college is taking to reduce
energy consumption He described
three levels of action that the
college could pursue. The first
level is called the “quick fix.”
These are methods to immediately
reduce energy use by insulating
buildings replacing windows and
doors, turning down heating.
using less cooling, and turning off
lights when lighted areas are not' in
use.

Hawn outlined several more
technical methods the college is
now using in relation to the
operation ol the physical plant. All
of these are now helping reduce
energy consumption.

THE mosr important ol these is
the peakload monitor. The utility
companies have rate systems
which penalize users who consume
a large amount of electricity
during peak periods. Peak periods
are simply those times when
electricity is being heavily used
ti.e —during the heat of a summer
afternoon).

if the maximum level |S reached,
the user can be penalized by being
charged for peak rates
during the entire billing period. So,
ilthe college vas mnning all its air
conditioners. food service
equipment, and lighting systems, it
could push the usage level above
tllc peak

TIIE MONITOR KEEPS an eye
on the level of electricity being
used. Ifusage begins to get close to
the peak, the monitor

even with this system. the elec~
trical usage may still reach the
penalty level.

A second level of action is the

this type ol action is dorm
renovation Here, the college is
restructuring wasteful buildings
into cnergyelncient buildings A
study done by VicerProvost Ken
.Broivning shows that renovated
Clark uses 50 percent less energy
than unrenovated Langan, a
building similar to Clark in size
and structure.

RENOVATION INVOLVES not
only insulation and door and
window replacement, but also
installation of better, more energy
efficient heating, cooling. and
lighting systems, Browning said,
He added that the dorm
renovation program, which will be
completed in the early 1980's, will

Grapevine:

by Paul Schwartz

‘ ‘The first thing you must ac-
cept is criticism,‘ " reads the
opening line of Grapevine, Fall '1x,
‘ ‘only after you do this can you
begin to learn and improve: "

According to many students,
however, the opening quote in the
Grapevine would apply just as well
to its staff as to the professors to
whom it was directed.

T0 BEGIN WITH, :1 Signi cant
number of students were unaware
of the release of this year's
Grapevine since it was only made
available for their taking in boxes
in the post office. In previous
years, mey were stuffed in student
mailboxes. The general response
to the Grapevine by those students
who were aware of its release was
that it was “incomplete,”
“illiterate,” and “fun to read, but
not worth depending on when '
choosing courses

Many students lelt that the ,
courselaculty evaluations offered
in the current Grapevine did not
reveal anything of interest. If num-
ber ratings were printed. several
students said, then a more ob-i
jective view of the classes and
ould be rendered,

 

energy efficient. other iuture
action in this area \Vill replace the
“archaic” radiator heating system
and liotnvater system, as physical
plant heating czar Gerald Armcnt
has l’clcrred to them

THE EXISTING radiator System
in most dorms is notoriously
schizophrenic, For example, a
single thermostat in each lounge
controls the heating levels for the
entire dorm. it the windowsurc left
open in the lounge (us they oiten
have been), the thermostaie
su‘ltches on and the whole dorm
gets broiled.

To avoid being sizzled out of their
rooms, students are Wont to
opening their windows to relieve
the heat and then untold amounts
of energy pour into the winter air.

AND YET, AT other times, heat
seems to be as ﬂeeting as an Iowa
spring

The hot water system is equally
byzantine. All South Campus hot
water except tor Loose Hall is
provided by one boiler under
Cleveland. The water ispumped all
the way to the third floor of Read
going one way, and to Main and
Mears going the other way.

 

LIKE THE HEATIA ‘

the hot water system can be
capricious. But lor the most part.
hot water is usually available. The
problem with the system at the
present time is the temperature
level. The physical plant people
have kept the temperature of the
hot \itlter at about 130 degrees
Fahrenheit, But Hawn says that
only about no degrees are needed
for a comfortable, warm shower
llc odds that people turn
on the Shower full blast to
warm it up. The shower heats up
to the too-hot 130 degree level. and
then the Student cools it down to a
comfortable level. In the process,
Jill that heat between the hottest
temperature and the comfortable
one is lost.

Hawn says he would like to lower
the basic temperature ol the boiler,
but has received complaints of the
water being too cool the past times
he has turned it down

FINALLY. THE THIRD level of

action is the complete replacement

victim of apathy?

in the paragraph form adopted by
this year's staff.

IF THE GRAPEVINE is to be
raised to the level of respectability
desired. however, the burden
lies at least as much on the
students as on uie Grapevine stall.
Unlike the random sample come
piled by the college from the return
of their “mandatory" course
evaluation sheets issued in classes
at the end of each semester,
response to the Gi pevinc
evaluation forms is left entirely to
the students' initiative.

Due to the rather haphazard
replies from the student body, the
leelings of several Grapevine staff
members is that the only students
who return the forms are ones who
either have a personal vendetta
against a certain professor or ones
who consider their prolessor a
living legend.

THE BEST WAY to compile the
Grapevine, suggested one smft
member, would be to base it on the
random sample run by the college.
However, the only way the ad.
ministration could manage to
organize their poll of student
response was to promise the
faculty that their lindings would be
unavailable to .

 

The staff member explained that
as matters currently stand, the
Grapevine staff can not gain
access to what is the most accurate
report of students’ feelings toward
their courses,

“It’s too bad the way things are
set up,” said one staff member,
“since many prolessors use their
evaluations constructively, but if
they were made available to
students then they would probably
never even be recorded.”

DUE TO THE lack of response to
the evaluation forms released by
the Grapevine staff, and since only
one student to date has requested
open access to the random sample,
according to this staff member,
then only student apathy can be
blamed for the insufficiency of the
current Grapevi .

“The problem," a staff member
said. “is that uie faculty is hyper-
sensitive. The protessors only take

. evaluations on the condition that

students don't see them.

If only the students cared more,
though, then there’d be more
returns (of the Grapevine
evaluation sheets). Don't bitch
unless you‘ re willing to return the
course evaluation forms or you
