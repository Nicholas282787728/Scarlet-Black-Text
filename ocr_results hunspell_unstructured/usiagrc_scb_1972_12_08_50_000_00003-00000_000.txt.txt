TV, House Presidents
Elections Concern SGA

by Merry Wiesner

Policy regarding televisions in the
dormitories was the main topic of
Wednesday's Joint Board meeting
The general fund for television re-
pair and maintenance has been de
pleted rapidly this year, which pro»
yoked a discussion of Who should be
responsible for funding purchase and
maintenance, in past years, this
was done with an assessment of all
the members of the hall inwhich the
television was located, but some hall
presidents feel this is not com-
pletely equitable, as students not
living‘ in that dorm are free to use
the television

After a rather long discussion of
Just how this funding should be
carried out, it was decided to ask
the admlnlnstration for adonation to
kick off a television fund for all»
campus use. The entire discussion
brought in the issues of responsi»
bility. with regard to recreational
equipment, and whether a television
should be regarded as an integral
part or a dormitorle’s equipment,
in the same way chairs and tables
in the lounges are.

The- pet policy passed several
weeks ago by the Joint Boards was
approved by President Leggett yes»
terday, and will go into effect
immediately, The Social Policies
and Regulations Committee, headed
by Jean King, recommended the
proposed policy including son
amendments to Leggett, with the
stipulation that there be an evalua-
tion of the effects of the regulation
change in the spring of 1973, Al-
though the Social Policies Como
mittee did not completelyagree with
all the amendments, it decided to
approve implementation of the
policy, with the requirements of fu-
ture anaylsis.

A number of house presidents will
not be on campus next semester,
which means that Several halls will
be holding elections to find replace»
ment.

tion for her successor; Amy Hughes

,I’et Policy
Clarification

There should be a clarification of
the explanation in last Friday's
Slit? ,of the new pet policy passed
last week by the Joint Board. Once
a complaint has been filed concern-
ing a particular pet, the pet owner
may ,or may not face his accuser
before the Pet Board, but the de'A
cision will be made by the accuser
rather than by the pet owner. Thus,
the pet owner does not have an ex-
plicit‘ right to demand such a hear»
ing,

in any case, however, the owner
will be informed as to the nature
of the complaint and the identity
of the complainant.

Details of the implimentation of the
policy are now being worked out by
the Social Policies and Regulation
Committee, according to Committee
chairman Jean King, and the pro»
cedures will likely go into ettect
for the second semester.

memo from Pfeffer placed in stu-
dent boxes earlier this week, Torn
Marcil and Lynn Lichtenberger were
chosen to help in the selection of
the six student members ' of the
board. Pteffer noted that these
were simply temporary appoint»

of the board will be chosen by
current board members.

Next semester's SGA budget is in
the process of being drafted and
treasurer Ed Hirsch requested that
anyone with suggestions for that bud-

as soon as possible.

The official resignations of the

The meeting ended on a rather light
note, as hall presidents were en-

Defends ISPIRG Study

by Curt Gorrell

There has been some consternation
among some students about ISPIRG's
role in conducting a "toy study”;
locating dangerous toys banned by
federal law on store shelves and
working for their removal Forthose
who do not find this effort consis»
tent with their image of a public
interest action group, 1 suggest that
the following two important factors
be considered.

First, a basic principle underlying
the whole toy survey is the fact that
a federal law was being ignored,
As the ISPIRG study and studies by
other PlRG groups across the na»
tion have documented, the FDA has
not been doing an adequate ion in
enforcing the law in this area The
PIRG groups are now publicly hold»
ing the FDA accountable.

Debate Team Organiled

by Elaine Carey

Elections nave hampered the aCr
tiv es of the debate team during the
ﬁrst semester. The debate squad,
which usually becomes active in
early October of the fall semester,
was activated this year inNovember
and has only observed one tourna-
ment at Iowa State University.

Many of the approximately dozen
debate members were participating
in the elections, which consumed the
time necessary for debate, accord»
ing to Mr. w.s. Vanderpool, Direc»
tor of Forensics.

An active schedule is on the cal»
endar for second semester which
will include tournaments at Tulane,
Jan. 25—27; Drake, Mar, 3; lowa
City, early Feb; and American Un-
iversity, during spring break. In ad»
dition, a British or Australian de-
bate team annually tours west of
the Mississippi during the second
semester and stops at Grinnell, Mr
Vanderpnol stated. No definite word

about this debate has been received
yet. The Hill Spealung Contest which
is an annual extemporaneousspeak»
ing on contemporary issues open to
participation by the campus will be
held again this year.

Jeff Facter, senior; Tom Knapp;
sophomore, Sally Oldham sopho—
more; and Jim Skarzynskl, sopho»
more are the lead members of the
squad which consists of four upper»
classmen and eight freshmen and
sophomores Tile team is a campus,
ite of the experienced and inexper»
ienced as the varsity is not separa-
ted, The team is open to all either
to learn or to compete. Meetings
will be two or three times monthly
and anyone who works :it all will
do some travelling, Mr. Vanderpool
explainedr

“Medical care and the govern»
ment” is the topic which the Amer»
ican Forensic Association chose for
most of the year's debates.

Secondly, toys may not be a ma»
jor concern or college students, but
at Christmas shopping time a great
number of lowa consumers are dir-
ectly affected by this study. The
plastic rattle with the spiked metal
prongs which are easily exposed, the
toy oven with surfaces that heat to
360 degrees, the toy plastic ride
that will chamber live ammunition
and blow up in a child’s hands all
present real hazards to the chil»
dren of these lowa consumers.

The experience of Ms. Dianne Pre»
court, Lin ISPIRG researcherwork»
ing in lowa City, is exemplary A
store clerk told Ms. Precourt that
she believed “you creepy students”
had no right to conduct the survey.
Ms. Precourt explained that shewas
working with ISPIRG, and was then
asked, “Where's your uniform?”
When Dianne showed the clerk the
federal booklet listing all the toys
banned by law, the clerk felt it was
“all a farce".

Amiddle-aged woman joined the
discussion. She said something to the
effect 0!, “Wait a minute. I saw this
girl on TV last night, and I'm glad
for what these college students are
doing, I'm a mother with two Chile
dren. I don't know what‘s safe to
buy; and if that’s the attitude you’re
going to take i won’t shop at your
store anymore.”

This study was a starting point for
ISPIRG. A number of projects are
already underway. Those who were
not excited by the toy study may find
interesting reading in the legislative
monitoring reports and thepublished
findings of lSPlRG‘s TRACIS inves-
tigation and hospital study, which
are currently in the works.

Pinball Fund
Allocated

by John Wylie

After almost four months of nearly
continuous debate, a compromise
plan for the distribution of revenue
from the pinball machines was ap,
proved by the Student Services Com-
mittee last Friday

Under the plan, which was proposed
by Dean of Student Affairs Conney
Kimbo, the Student Government As-
sociation will receive a flat $1,000
from the Fund, while the Forum Sub
Committee will retain control ofthe
remainder of the fund through the
end of calendar 1972.

SGA will assume complete control
of the pinball machines' operation
and will receive all new income be»
ginning January 15, 1973, The Forum
Sub»Committee will use most of the
funds it retains to install two new
film projectors and new sound equip-
ment in ARH Auditorium by theFall
of I973.

Controversy over the issue began
early this year when SGA began
searching for additional sources of
money. Thepinball fund cameunder
scrutiny because ofthe sizeable bal-
ance which has built uplnit during
the second semester of last year.

However, the Forum Sub-Commit-
tee, working under the informal 3r,
rangement through which the ma»
chines were first installed, had al—
ready budgeted the pinball revenue
for replacement oi equipment in the
Forum and the purchase of updated
equipment for use in ARH Auditor-
ium.

Alter a plan was approved in early
November which allowed SGA to take
control of all coin operated machines
on the Campus, the question arose
over the disposition of funds taken in
by such machines beforethe new plan
was approved.

With Friday‘s compromise, SGA
will get $1000 plus the pinball pro»
lists-from » - ' ' " "r
fits from Second semester (esti»
mated at over $60 per week) while
the Forum Sub-Committee will Cons
tinue its programs with revenue re»
maining in the Pinball Fund (about
$2300) and the Juke box fund (about
$1700).

a new yearly $2.00 per student Fore
um fee will be instituted in the Fall
of 1973,
