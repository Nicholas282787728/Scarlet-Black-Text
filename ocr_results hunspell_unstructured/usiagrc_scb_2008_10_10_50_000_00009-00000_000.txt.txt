it was 3 am., and my tr-irrrt
awake and hungry, so nr r pals srcve lloft and r
llughes, along with m It, artist chatter and spectre
latrorr about the upcoming election, decided to drrve to
The Pinec 1 diner we knew of about 20 minutes
east of Giiiinell on 1-80.

“Obama's gorng to win lowa, he’s rrp by ten points,"
my friends ltcpr reassuring me as we sped down the
highway.

“Are you sure?"1 would ask, skeptical, “See that
farm? You think that farmer is an Obarna voter>

The conversation slowly diverged from one topic
to the next: Palm and the Campus Democrats. pohce
brutality and farm animals, Hitler and the Jews, the
chicken and the egg. And then we extted the high
way and pulled into a parking lot filled with trucks,
compact Fords and a peculrarly high number of police
cars.

We followed a state trooper into the diner.

People talk at unnecessarily high volumes rn The
Pineeone. “What kind ofmotheif- king s--t is this?"
We heard a Customcr say, imme .tely after setting
foot in the restailrant. “Go back and get me another
feekrn’paneake you ("king fool."

The waitress responded: “Well tank you, you fer
king uptight c——ksucker." It felt like stepping directly
into the text of: David Mamet play, As we continued
in, every single customer nrrned around and stared at
tis.

“Do y'all go to Grinnell College>"a young woman
asked, after looking at my t-sh t. She sat with a group
ofpeople who looked like they \vele close to our age,

“Yes," we said,

As we scanned our rnerrrrs, we
heard someone shout, “Vi/hy don’t
you dumb punks shut the feel: up>"

He was addressing our newly made

enemies, who then exclaimed, “Vi/mild you mind your
own business, and stop hurting in? We are trying to
have a couversarron wrtlr these people!”

“Hey f--k you"

“Hey feek you rwrce."

Whttt transpired next confuses me For a good ten
minutes, these two partrcs exchanged insults, all coded
in the most rrsihly vulgar and derogatory language
imaginable. And the entire time, my friend Steve
kept whispering. “see. Harsha, this rs Obama country.
These are Obama voters."

Finally, oui ally (who was an elderly man), and a
rnuscrrlaryoung man sittrng at the other tahle,decidet1
to settle therr dispute wrth a right. They walked outs
side the diner and onto the pavement. Eveiyone else
screamed, “ﬁght!" and headed for the window to watch
through the glass.

“Should I call the cops)" The waitress asked,
“They're sitting in the back room,"

“No, no, no,“someonc replied, promptly, “we wanna
watch the fight," The three ofus just sat thetc,dumhe
founded, in disbelief. A brawl had just broken out, and
we had started ll» \’Ve looked for a way to leave.

A, few minutes later, our y came hack to (the
other group had left) and this tune, he decided to srt
with 115 “Min, I wIs about to kill him he recount-
cd. “I was gonna jam my thumb in his throat and krli
hirn."11e proceeded to spend the next half hour de-
scribing ways to kill people. Usiri screwd aver was
too Ioutl,we learned, and usrng ouc hands often took
too long The entire tirnc we made our best attempt

at remaming congcnral. “Oh,
really,” we would say, or, "that’s
too had, big messes are never
fun to clean up."

This sort of talk was mixed
in with bits of social commen-
tary. The media makes fun of people too rrruch, he
told us, and this was something he hates, He esper
cially didn't like it when people made fun of racists.
“I mean for heaven sakes, this is America. Let them
be,"he proclarmed. Finally. he got up and left for the
restroom. We thought about putting some cash down
on the table and sprintrng for our car, but we decided
that the situation had cooled down enough, that this
man was on our side, and that we really wanted to an-
ish our omelettes.

At my insistence, Steve decided to ask this man a
rather profound question when he returned. “Sit, are
you an Obarna man or a McCain man?"

“Vi/ell,” he began, “to tell you the trilth I don't re-
ally lilce either of them, But I'll tell you what. That
rrmnrng mate of John McCain's, I'd really like to see
her in some porni 1 mrght not vote for henbut I’d pay
for that!"

Wrth that, he had crossed the line of being just
too cgrcgrous We thanked him for hrs company and
began to leave, “Do y'all have phone numbers?" he
inquired, "we need to hang out sometime."

”Nope,wc'te from out of town."

 

Effects of trustees coming to town on students

Boxed dinners in the dining hall

Last Friday, the dining hall underwent a massive
transformation, turning our favorite marketplace into
a fancy restaurant with the addition of tablecloths and
ﬁne china, Unfortunately, students did not get to ob
serve this makeover. As the dining hall catered veal
and three courses ofwrne for the trustees and visiting
alumni, Grinnell’s students were served box dinners
out ofa refrigerated truck.

For students who have been here for a few years,
this probably wasn't that surprising. When alumni
who have donated extensively come throrrgh town
they are treated like royalty, while current students and
recent alumni aic left behind. Of course alumni and
trustees should get a warm
welcome when they visit the
college, but we feel that the
college too often overlooks
the fact that it is the current
students who will be the dot
nating alumni ofthe future.

\’Ve all love out time at
Grinnell College and intend to be supportrve alumni,
but at times it can seem as ifthe college forgets that
in ten years we Will he the ones they approach when
fundraising, We shorrld be upset about the fact that
the trustees did not hear student presentations dut-
rng their visit last weekend (see following staffed), but
perhaps even more important is therr approach to im-
proving the college.

When one looks at the strategic planning of the
college, its priorities can seem to he more in creating a
better business rather than creating a better experience
for students currently on Campus When there are
not enough professors in some departments and class
choices are limited for current students, the trustees
and administration decide to focus on building new
faci 'tiesiwhich while obviously providing nrrmerous
benefrts to studentsimainly serve to improve the nut
age ofthe school.

A key part of the triistees‘job is to look out for
the long-term welltbeing of the college, but we think
that there needs to be equal focus on what the cur-
renr students care aborrt Even though that may seem

shortsighted, in the end it may well ctid
, rrp beneﬁting our already strong endow-

merrr, oiicc current students move beyond
their college debts and have their own
well paving jobs.

Fitting ofthrs attitude, while students
were eating the due dollar frozen lasagna
last Friday, scnror Challengeithe Colt

lcge's drive to get scnrors to donate—held rts kickoff.
Many of us probably want to donate, but when the
school seems to favor only those who have already
donated extensively rather than the students spending
nine months every year in cr-irrnell, some current st ,

dents may be more hesitant before they pull oiit their
checkbook

Student- -trustee communication

As students, out lrves ere affected by trustee decie
sions. Frorn hiring administrators to funding important
events on campus, the trustees significantly shape our
Grinnell experience. With all the power trustees have
to improve Grinnell, it is surprising that this year, at the
quarterly trustee weekend, students were not provided
with a forrrm at which they could present rdeas about
important campus issues to the trustees.

in past years, student-trustee forums have been a
place for students to present campus improvement ideas
to the trustees who can then allocate funding, This for
mal communication between students and trustees is
important because the forrrm allows trustees to remain
connected to surdents crrrrenrlv attending Grinnell

There rs ample evidence of the usefulness of thrs
forum Over the past two ycarc students from FrecTho
Planet successfully lobbied for wind power on campus,
Tlrrs year however, students weren't even grven a chance
to realize the same success achieved by FTP.

instead ofhaving a studenrerrustce forum, this year
the trustees “communicated"with students by watching
the vice pre dential debate with them. Though this
does provrde a srtuarion for students and trustees to
hang out together, it is not an appropriate setting for
students to vorc concerns about campus.

Communication between students and trustces is
necessary to forwarding inrportant campus projects.
Next time, let's talk.
