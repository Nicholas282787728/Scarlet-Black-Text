It is the start of a
new Semester. This
means that everyone
has a new haircut, new
room, and a new
outlook. And by new
outlook I of course
mean that everyone is
looking for a new
signiﬁcant other.
That's right, by this
time in the semester
you were probably a
dumper or a dumpee
(and yes, it was
because of your new
haircut), And about
three weeks into the
semester, the First-
years will terminate
their long distance
relationships, having
realized that a long~
distance relationships
equals a short-distance

relationships minus the
sex, plus the phone
bill.

This mass-dumping
creates a glut of
brokenhearted
Grinnellians who are
either ready to kill or
cry. And there is no
better remedy for
broken hearts then
listen to the same CD
on repeat until you
feel a little better or at
least until your
roommate puts Steve
Larson on speed dial.
The only question left
is, which" CD should
you play?

If you still care for
the jerk, Irecommend
that you pick up some
music that falls in to
the sad-bastard genre.
Try anything by The
Smiths, Mazzy Star, or
Portishead. '

If you actually want
to recover and move
on, try something
uplifting, like Brenda
Weilel’s Crazy Happy.

If you want to maul
your ex, I recommend
that you visit the
Mental Health Center
(and bring an
implement, because
she will be there too).
If you are a girl and
just want to hurt your
ex symbolically, I
suggest picking up
Bays for Pele by Tori

' Amos or Dilute by Ani
Difranco. Or you can
put "Positively 4TH
Street" by Bob Dylan
on repeat.

If you are a boy and
are feeling especially
hurt, grow up and stop
crying, you baby.

Folkstress on the rise

Brenda Weller and Grinncll Collcgc
go way back. When Weilot played a show
here at Grinnoll [Wu yczlrs ago, shc moved
a standing ovation. Wt lovcd lict folk and
hcr honcsty. and sht lorcd our praise and
support In fact, she was so wcll rcccivcd
here that she thnnltcd thc collogc in tho
linear notes oflict second album. Wt, in
tutti, invrrccl her back thc 11ch ycar to play
a concctt at tho AIDS Bcncfit. She's a
tcfrcshingly original folk singcr who lives
the life that most Grinnolians are striving
for. She is cteativc, concerned, self-emc
played, and good at what sho does.

Now it's thc fall orzooo and \‘i/cilct
has rolcastd her third album, FIyM: Bar/t.
She has also been named Female Vocalist
ofthcvcar by tho Minncsota MusicAcacls
tiny, Musician orthc voar (for thc last two
ycars) by tho High Plains Reader, and Best
chalcVocolist in tthwin Citics by City
Pages. Various critics havc Compared hot

many agree with the Salt Lako City
Weekly that “shc is not for from folkstar»

One cannot hcip but Wonder why
Wcilcr is not more popular siiicc she to

all over the Midwest. For instance, how
come Wcilct has only sold 6,000 CDs

thousand times more’ The answer lies in
Wcilcr's musical philosophy. As an lnthe

The New Album

“1 nist wantcd to go all oni cre-

Label Change

Wcilci's ﬁrst two albums were put
out by Barking Dog Records, a small ins
