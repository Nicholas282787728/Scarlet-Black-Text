At1:40 p m ycstciday, Chicfof Security stout Briscoe sent
an e- mail to students declaring that the college was closing
This email was the ﬁrst that most administrative departments
hear-d of the closing. jennifcr Krohn, Dean for Strident Llfe,
unawarc of thc announcement, was out chccking on her dog
and returned to ﬁnd a campus full ofchaos and unSIIOns.

The City of Grinncll, along with the rest oflowa, has been
in a state of ﬂux since last weekend, when a vicious ice storm
knocked out powsr for most ufthe state. Dospitc powcr con-ls
panics' generally successful attempts to bring power back to
most oft‘he state, a new storm, traveling from the west, threat-
ens to completely reverse many of the temporary ﬁxes to the
power system.

The college has not closed due to weather since 1985, and
while an Emergency Response Committee has been trying to
create a plan to both deal with the effects of the last ice storm
and make preparations for the next one, closing the school was
not ono ofthc options discussed at length. The city ofGrinncll
has set up a shelter and “warming ccntcr"at thc thnncll Ath-
letic and Recreational Center (GARC) at Ahrens Park.

In addition, the Grinnell Regional Medical Center and the
Mayﬂowcr tcsidcntial facility both offer beds and hot meals
to those in need. Chief of Police Jody Matherly encouraged
everyone without power to go immediatelyto a shelter. “Don‘t
try to tough it out on your own," he said.

Elcctricity is one of the major concerns for those involved in
the emergency preparations. Last weekend s ice storm caused
immense damage to almost all parts of the electrical system,
according to Erin Dammen, spokesperson for Alliant Power.
“[The ice] makes the system vulnerable,"she said. “[Lincs] are
designed to sustain a lot of Mother Nature, but this was the
worst ws'vc sccn." At press time, only as people in Grinnell
worc without powcr, and in surrounding arcas, the initial
200,000 without power had dccicascd to only 21,000.

On campus, administrative offices have tried to prepare for
the next wave ofillclemcnt weather. The Roscuﬁcld Center has
a power gcncrator, and whilo the generator cannot pnwtr this
whole building, it can sustain certain areas. For instance, with
tho powcr outagc last weekend, Dining Services could only or
fer a cold buffet to students. Since then, Director ofDining
Services Dick Williams has Worked with the Eincrgcncy Rc-
sponse Committee to ﬁgure out the best ways to offer food to
the campus community. “As far as the college was concerned,
dining services was] a priority,”Williams said.

This' semester, recognizing the potential for exploitation

(SPARC) has taken stops to keep a closcrwatch ovci- publica-

of setting the overall budget for each of the campus‘s five per-

In addition, KIOlln and Williams have worked with other
administrators to offer off-campus students a rcducedmrte
meal plan while thcy arc without power. “We’ve put togothcr
at least some plans to handle this," said Williams.

Off-campus students are a major concern for the admln'lSt
tration. According to SGA President Chris Hall ’07, the school
already has priority status in buying fuel, and thcrstorc students
in dorms will still have heart and limitcd lighting in hallways
should the power go out.

Off- campus, thcrc arc no such guarantees. Through scvcral

In the larger Grinuell community, the police department,
fire department and hospital have worked with other commu-
nity groups to try to maintain order and safety. The Grinnell
Regional Medical ccntcr has been an rntcgral part otthc rc-
sponsc effort.

According to David Ness, Vice President ofOpcrations and
Chief Frnanclal Officer for the hospital, the hospital relied on
its emergency generator for electricity and never lost power.
Ness said volunteers contacted all those in the area with serious
medical conditions and particularly those who rcly on oxygen
machines to make sure their needs were met throughout the

Months later, Shuman-Moore still missed

av RACHEL FIELDS
Five months after Paul
Shuman-Moorc '09s disap-
pcarancc, thc Grinncll Col—
lcgc campus has changed.
Search ﬂyers have long since
fallen down, and planlovc-
for [shumanmo] is steadily
dcclining. The collcgc has
ceased formal discussion of
his' absenccibut Sllumans
Moore is far from forgotten.
“I still think about hiln
a lot," said Noah Bindman
‘07, who played on Grinncll's
Ultimate Frisbee team with
Shumﬂntlvlool‘c. “it's just not
in a way that affects my da .,
[0-day llfc anymore."
Shuman-Moore was last
soon on Sept, 25, 2005 in
Grinncll; search efforts cir-
sucrl, but he has not yet hccn
found. On Feb, 13, Griuuell
students received a campus
wide crmail from Shumans
Moorc’s family, announcing

the continuing starch and
encouraging students to hang
posters. Since little word on
the Shumun-IVIoore case had
been recently rclcascd, many
students were confused.

“I was really curious as to
why they sent out the email,"
said Stcphanic Roscnbanrn
'08 I thought it had some—
thing to do with ﬁnding him,
and it “Ms 'rcally sad whtn
they hadn'."t

Students who knew Shut
man-Moore admit that while
they still hope for his return,
his disappcarancc is no lon-
gel‘ always at tho torch-oat or
their minds.

“You can't sit here and
dwcll on it, or you won't get
anything clsc done," said
Biudman.

Bindinan added that many
ofhis teammates l'cﬁlsc to ac-
ccpt ihc possibility of Paul’s
dcath. “People will say things

like,‘When Paulcomcsback’," -

he said. “I think a lot ofus are
just waiting for that."

Other students are hesr
taut tr) assume that campus
has recovered from thc disap-
pearancc. “I think it's impor-
tant that even though pcoplc
arcn’t scarching for him or
talking about hiln or he's not
rhc front page of the SUB,
it docsn‘t mean that people
aren't thinking about hun,"
said Rachel Osborne '07.

Brndman also thinks that
campus discussion and couns
seling should continue to ads

dress students’ mental health. .

“I know people are getting
upsct at tltomsclvcs for not
thinking about itall the time,"
he said.

Though littlc nows has
rclcascd about the
search, some students still feel
