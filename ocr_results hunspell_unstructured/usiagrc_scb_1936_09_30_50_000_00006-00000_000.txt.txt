Des Moines, 1a.. Sept. 29 (Spe-
ciallili‘ootbnll teams representing
Drake and Oklahoma A. 8: M.
have been the dominating factors
in the Missouri Valley conference
since the breakup with Big Six
Schonls in 1927, a. survey revealed
here today.

Including the seasons 1923 and
1935, Oklahoma‘s Cowboys have
won two undisputed Valley cham-
pionships and shared in two
others. Drake captured the solo
right to one crown and won parts

of three others.
make Wins In 1923

Drake, under 0ssie Salem, won
a clear out championship in 1923,
lthe first year of the new group,
1and in 1929 shared honors with
“Fuzz" Watt's Gnanell team.
Salem's 1930 and 1931 outfits, al-
though they played and won twice
as many games as did the Aggies,
were rorced to divide title honors
withe Cowboys since the two
teams did not meet.
I Oklahoma A. & M., however,
rcigned supreme in 1932 and 1933,
which saw the school represented
lby some of its best teams, coached
by Lynn Waldorf. Both Solem and
\Naldort are now in the Big Ten,
Salem ilt Iowa. and Waldorf at
Northwestern.

Washington In 1934

Washington had a powerful
teem under Jimmy Conzelman in
1934 and was awarded to title
although playing only one con-
ference contest. Last year the
Bears swept through their three
league games, but so did Gloomy
-Gus Henderson’s Tulsa. Hurricane,
so the two teams split the title

Washington however, this year
won't get a chance to retain its
championship honors since'only
two Valley games are on the sche-

 

l

 

dule and a new ruling requires a
team to play three in order to be
considered eligible for the title.
Fire Valley Games

This fall Drake plays five Valley
games, Washhurn four, Grinnell,
Creighton, Tulsa, and Oklahoma
Al & M. three each.

and lost since 1927. Drake has the
best record, Bulldog teams have
won 20. lost 3 and tied 2 for a
.714 percentage. Oklahoma A. h
M. won 10. lost 6 for a .625 per-
centage.

. . . for tobacco
cut right to smokg right

There’s a right way to carve a chicken or slice a ham.
And there’s a right way to cut tobacco.

When the tobacco in your cigarette is cut the way
it is in Chesterﬁeld . . . right width and right length
. . . it burns even and smooth . . . it smokes better.
