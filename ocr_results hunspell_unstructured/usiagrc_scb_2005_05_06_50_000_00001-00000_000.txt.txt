FM, custodians’ union gear
up for summer negotiations

sv BEN WEVL
For the ﬁrst time in three years, the custodial staff
will negotiate a new contiact with their employer, Fat
cilities Management (FM). Neither party wishes to
show too much orits hand for fear ofcndangeriug the
negotiations that are scheduled to take place in July,
The custodians, who are unionized, are led by SEV’
eral stewards and union leaders. One steward, who
wished to remain nameless. said that he did not want
to tell what the Teamsters Local #90 union planned
to present in order to have more leverage over FM.
FM was also hesitant to divulge information
about the upcoming negotiations In one c-niail, FM
Director Mark Godar wrote, "One provision of the
contract is that the College recognizes the Union as
the exclusive bargaining agent for our FM shops em-
ployees. Therefore, the College
cannot speak to you or anyone

a moderatc in this, I'm not pushing out way or the
other, try to hold an even keel if we could.:’ he said.
"But when gas can jump 30, 40 cents a gallon,l think
everybody in the country, ii'yon haven‘t been under a
rock, knows what's been going on. That is out of our
hands and we need help with it."

Another custodian on South campus agrees: “1
think all everybody really wants is a raise. We didn't
get much of one last time, compared to everybody
else." Three years ago, the custodial staﬂ‘ received a
one percent increase in pay, while other FM employt
ees such as grounds and trade stanroccivod a 4.5 per
cent increase.

A custodian on East Campus also criticized FM
for the small increase.“l3y thc timcyou take taxes out,
our one percent increase looks like a lot less," she said,
“I'm hoping that both [sides] will go to the table with

an open mind and really consider the

for gas, rood, clothes 7 everything is

gummy is a raise. We didn’lgelmutil going up."

After further quesrioningt ofane/asll/memmparedto

Godar responded, “We have an
agreement that is renegotiated
every three years. We sit down
with the Union and like any nc- ——

gotiation, discuss what is and isn't

working and identify the issues that are most pressing
and important. We try to resolve it and come to an
agreement. We (as the College) tccl strongly about
the hard work that our FM staff gives us and are come
mitted to agreements that me fair."

However, not all custodians feel that their emr
ployer. FM, acts tairly.Thrce workers were willing to
speak about some of their issues with FM, although
none were Willing to provide their names for this are
ticle. The first two work on South Campus; the final
one works on East Campus.

One South Campus custodian hopes that both
custodians and FM take a reasonable look at the simt
ntion. “I’d like to see moderation where the college
understands that the cost of living, through no fault
of ours, is increasing," the custodian said. The custoe
dian mentioned the rising cost of oil.“It costs more to
heat your house. It costs more to get to work. We may
need some help there with some money. On the other
hand,I understand that the benefit package [that is
provided] is a really good thing."

The source does not considei his views extreme,
although he notes the increasingly unfortunate eco-
nomic environment. “I would have to say that I’m

everybody”

In addition to the desired pay in-
crease, many custodians simply want
increased and clearer communication

than on South Campus, “They say

their door is always open, but it’s not.
As soon as you get in tlicte, tbcy slam it in front of
you,” she said, “I don't think they care what we think,
so we’ie just left out. The communication is teirible,
And you’ve got so many bosses that one tells you one
thing and the other one tells you another."

The custodian from East Campus agrees: “I think
there’s a lack of communication,“ she said. “I don’t
think we are as well informed as we should be of
things that are happening in our building from time
to time. w.hen projects will begin and when they will
be over with, so we can do our job

A custodian from South Campus also said that
having the negotiations in the summer placed Custer
dians at a disadvantage. “Ifwe don't like something,
the students sometimes help out and try to get somer
thing done."she said. She recalled the structural shift
ofmaking custodians divide their time between work
ing in a dorm and in an academic building. “When we
were raising heck about coming over heie after we’d
bccn in the academic buildings tor eight hours a lot of
professors tried to help."

She is not hopeful for the coming negotiations.
”No, I don't think we will be successful. They [the

Osgood announces adminstrative changes at the top

lsv DAVID MONTGOMERY

In an alltcampus email sent on April 29, President
Russell Osgood anounced a reorganization of top
college administration. The announcement followed
the resignations of Jonathan Brand, vice president of
institutional and budget planning, and Todd Reding,
vice president of alumni relations and development.

Associate Dean Marci Sortor has been promoted
to ﬁll Brand’s position as Vice President for Campus
Planning for an initial twtryear period.

“I thought that two years would give me a good
sense of whether I was making a good contribution
or not," said Sortor. She will also remain an associ-
ate dean to continue her work with the Expanding
Knowledge Initiative (EKI).

Sortor said that she would keep the two jobs
separate, “The BIG is something that everyone re-
ally acknowledges is a part or the academic side or
the college experience, and not administrative." Sort
tor does not expect to be overburdened. She said a

number at projects being run by Brand, including
the strategic planning initiative, which are nearing
completion,

“In any particular year, you might be winds
ing some things down, and working extra hard on
other things," Sortor said. "It’s for President Osgood
to decide when the BIG has proceeded enough to
hand it otrto someone else.”According to Osgood's
eemail,the Dean's ofﬁce will begin looking for more
staffto fulfill some of Sortor's duties.

Other changes have been made in response to
Reding’s resignation. Reding’s Ofﬁce ofAlumni Ree
lations and Development has been merged with the
Ofﬁce of Communication and Events into a new
Office of College and Alumni Relations. Mickey
Munley ‘87, currently vice president of communieat
tion and events, will lead the new department.

According to Osgood’s email, Vice-President for
Diversu'y Frank Thomas ‘71 has decided to begin
gradually reducing his duties. Thomas’ work to err

courage campus diversity is being redistributed. Act
cording to Thomas, the exact duties which he will
maintain next year has not been decided,

“[Osgood] is reviewing the things that I do now,"
Thomas said, “He and I are meeting... to talk about
what those duties will be."

Thomas said he doesn’t like to look at it as a m,
tiremenr. “I like to use 'next phase of my life,” he said.
“That phase might begin in two or three years. It de-
pends on whatwe decide my duties might be over the
next few years."

Thomas, who will be turning 61 next month, does
not intend to retire next year because he will not be
eligible for full Social Security benefits until he is 65.
“It’s not financially feasible,"Thomas said.

Finally, Osgood announced that Jim Sumner,
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid, will now re-
port directly to the President’s office. He formerly
reported to Tom Crndy, Vice-President for Student
Services. Crady will now supervise campus security.
