BUSINESS BLUE HEIRS a.
[IHAHLES LYNI] SUNDAY

General iL-tuagcr of “Successful Funn-
ing" Addresses acting—Club
Elects 0iiiccrs.

Charles Lynn of Des iloines. gene
erai manager of "Successful Farming”
and former Grinnell athlete, was the
speaker at the Sunday afternoon ses<
sion of the Grinnell Business cluh. hlr.
Lynda gave rt great deal of color to
his talk on "The Personnel Depart»
ment of Successful Farming" by tell-
ing a number of stories concerning the
men with whom he had come in con-
iact. His speech was declared to he
one of the best of the year by certain
prominent members of the club.

Basing his remarks upon the story
of the rise of a young college fellow
in the service of his organization, the
Des Moines man told considerable
about the work of the Personnel De—
partment. Its work, he explained.
was done under three heads, employ-
ment, welfare and efficiency. All the
hiring and firing of the "successful
Farming" plant is done by this depart-
ment, "For I believe that the man who
isn't big enough boss to oversee with—
out the powers of firing shouldn't he
boss,” said Mr. Lynd.

Never Drives Workers

Mr Lynd has never believed in driv.
ing the workers; nor does he believe
in doing welfare work among them,
for they do not like it. “it is true
that we have established rest rooms,

'lunch rooms, and a bureau for medical

treatment, in addition to providing
liberally for the social side of the
workman‘s life, but our method of se-
curing service is primarily different.

We prefer to tie up privileges with
obligations. By means of a provis-
ional bonus we stopped gambling. We
inaugurated vacations with pay for
those of our workers who were punct-
ual, and thus stopped tardiness."

is business meeting followed the
short round-table discussion. After
a constitution had been read and ad:
opted, by~laws were voted upon and
the election of officers was held. The
executive council, consisting of Don-
ald Fullerton. Floyd Green and Ger—
ald Griffin was disbanded and in its
place a set of two officers was elect-
ed. Gerald Griffin was unanimously
selected president and Donald Fuller-
ton was elected to be secretary-treas-
urer from a list of three nominations.
