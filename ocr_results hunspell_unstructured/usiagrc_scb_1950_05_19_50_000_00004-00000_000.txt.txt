points to 561/2 points for Grin-
nell. Cornell, in third place, to-

Bonyata in the 220-yard dash,
Gene Parker in the javelin, and
the Grinnell relay team of AC7

Netmen Take Third Meet in Rowl#

Wednesday at Mt. Vernon, the
Pioneer netmen made It threat
in a row as they posted their
sixth and iinal dual meet win

The Scarlet and Black swept
both doubles encounters as well
as three out oi the tour singles
matches. Coach John Pfitschs
crew is currently engaged in the
conierence meet which lasts
through Saturday at Mt. Vernon.

Tight Race

The league will, be a lot
tighter this year due to the loss
of Beloit’s Bill Sayres and the
Viking’s John Dupont, both of
whom have dominated the loop

. by going to the singles finals
during the past three years.

Lawrence, deiending champ—
ion will be favored to retain its
crown, despite the loss of Du—
pont. Although the Vikings
dropped three matches this seats
on, they did beat Beloit last
week in the Wisconsin statc col—
lege invitational meet. Along

top dash man with a double
win, taking the 100 and 220—
yard sprints, as well as run.
on the winning
team. Gage, Acton, and Young
ran with Bonyata in the relay.‘

 

with Lawrence and Beloit, Grinrl
ncii, Knox, and Carleton rate as]
contenders.

Belnit Sensational l

Individually, Beloit’s sopho-
more sensation, Mel Grobe and
Lawrence’s Gordon Alstron rank
as possible new conference
semi—finalist, and Joe
Popple also rates attention.

Knox stands the best chance
of taking the doubles title. The
Siwash combination of Hurst
and Hegel, runners—up last seals—
on, will be favored as Viking
coach Art Dennly will not play
his championship duo oi Alston
and Tippett in order to enter
Alston in the singles draw. l

By virtue of the 673 record
set by the Scarlet and Black
in its best tennis season since
the war, Grinnell is considered
the dark horse of the league
meet.

Grinnell Record l,

Playing the toughest schedule:
in many years, Grinnell racked
up wins against Coe, Cornell,
Drake, Iowa State, Iowa State
Teachers, and Southern lllindls
univer. ty, eThe three Pioneers'
losses were to unbeaten Omaha
university, undefeated Washing-
ton university of St. Louis, and
Kalamazoo college.

Coach John Pfitsch plans to
enter Joe Popple and Earl Peis-
ner in the singles bracket. Playr
ing double tor the Pldneers will
be Phil Bennet and Bob Skram»
ka, a new combination which
showed promise in downing the
number one duos oi Iowa State
and Cornell.

 

Although unable to cope \Vlthi
the top four varsity men, Roger
Hartung, number five player for
Griniieii, has gone the season
undefeated in ten intercollegiate
matches. ‘
