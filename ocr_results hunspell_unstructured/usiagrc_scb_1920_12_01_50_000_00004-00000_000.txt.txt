sconsin Considers
Junior College Plan

The proposition of establishing a
junior college in Wisconsin is one

 

gives Grinnell students an idea of the
esteem in which outside colleges hold,
Dr. E. A, Steiner: ,
“Pr-o'f. Ed\val‘d\Alh'ed Steiner, who,
is to givc the Union Service Thalllissl
g' ' g address today, is a man of deal
knowledged ability as a sociologist;
author, and speaker. Born in Vienna, i
he came to this country shortly after;
receiving a. degree at the University ‘
of Heidelberg During his career her-e ,
he has bgcn clcrgyman, journalist and i
an authority on the immigrant, Among
his books are “Tolstoy, the ilan," "On ,
the Trail of the liriiuigi-ant," and “The ,
immigrant Tide." l
“With Prolessor Steiner as princi—l
pal speaker anyone who lails to ut-i
tend the Union Tlrair . cc,

Wisconsin — Tire erection or two“
dormitories, one [or rrien and onc for‘
women, will be included among the,
urgent building needs of the Uliivc
sity of x cousin as prcscnted lo the,
next session of the legislature, The»
decision to urge the erection of dormi- ,
tories during the present biennium;
was voted by the board or regents at:
its last meeting.

amendment to the tradition, but no
one seemed to be able to find out in
whose power the power to decide lay.
Petitions were circulated, but obtain—
ed no results. Aitel' thc starting of
the recreational hours, agitaitron died
down.

This year the subject was once
more brought before the students has
cause or the met that it had been the
custonr in the past to vote on the
question every third year. It was dis.
covered, however, that tho Stud/2mm
body as a whole did not have the‘
power to decidc, and a general ballot
was not taken, Later it w s brought
to the attention of the league boar-d
that it lay within the power of the
W. s, G. L. to pass on the question,
and at a meeting held tivo weeks ago
it was decided to draw up an itinende
merit to suitably change the regulate
tions to fill the present day needs,
Yesterday the amendments were pose
ted, and last night a mass meeting
was called to vote on the amends
ments.

The feeling that the League hoard
did not provide suitable amendments
to consider kept the number at the
meeting small.

Whether the matter will ever be
brought up again is a matter or con—
jecture. Tuesday's vote was cxpectcd
to have settled the matter definitely
for all time, but what is tcrmcd by
many as an unsatisfactory compro-
mise, oiree more leaves the question
unclosed.

which promises to receive attention
of theiWiscousin legislature at the
next session. The lili‘geriuci'ease of
' )enses at the University of Wiscon-
sin and the call for upwards of 515,7
000,000 for the next biennium will
make it liecessaiy for some plans to
he made lor- reducing the expenses.
The state board of education will
p -obably submit a plan to the leg
lature for the establishment or junior
colleges in several different cities of
the stoic. These junior colleges could
be operated in connection with the
schools and will probably perform the
first two years or college Work.

When this matter- was first talked
of two years ago the cities of 0s —
kosh, Racine, Superior, Eau Claire,
La Crossc and Milwaukee were men-
tioned as probable centers tor Junior-
high scliool,. it has been thought
possible that the first junior college
in the state would be established at
Racine where thc Racine College w s
formerly located and that the build-
ings ol this institution would be util—
.ctl, Some plan of this sort will
probably be voted on at the coming
session of the legislature in order to
reduce the expenses or higher educa-
tion in Wisconsin.
