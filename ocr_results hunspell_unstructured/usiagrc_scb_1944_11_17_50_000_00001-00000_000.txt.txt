Mime Shows Wit
InESatiric Roles

By Vl‘ ginia Foote

Through pantomime, costume, and simple dances Anglia
Enters plesented a series of characters in a valiety of
historical settings before a large audience in ARH audi-

torium Monday night.

program They were in the mainl

satiric: "American Ballet" ridi-
culed popular dances of World
War I. and incidentally most
popular dances. by showing how
they appear when passce. while
“Ballctumane - Connoisseur" was
nothing but a succession of
poorly-executed ballet steps inn
tended to satirize thc ”arty" type.

Cynical Expressions Best

Miss Enters‘ facial expressions,
which were necessarily exagger-
ated to make up for the absence
of words, were most successful
in attitudes of disillusionment and
cynicism. Her “innocent child-
hood" in Little Sally Water was
a burlesque, which lessened the
effectiveness of the mature W0m~
an’s grief when she realized that
she was growing old. The styliz-
ed purity, devotion, and sorrow
of the Virgin Mary were much
better, but not so sharp and
memorable as the Spanish lady’s
undistilled hatred in “Pavanar
Spain, 16th century," and the
brokenrdown cocotte’s restless and
observant eye in “Aphrodisiac-
Grccn Hour."

Symbolism Slightly Obscure

The success of several acts de-
pended upon interpreting the
symbols. The rose which the
Queen of Heaven fondled appar-
ently symbolized the chivalric

conception of the virgin, and herltremely limited dramatic field.

The demands of her medium
made it necessary for her to re-

iHonor 6 Cabin
,Moved +o Farm
Oi Grinnell Grads

The Honor G cabin will be mov-
ed next week to a new, more
convenient location. Miss Clara
Andersen, professor ot women's
physical education, announced.
Having sold the land on which
I the cabin now stands. the college
iis moving it to a site tWo miles
due west of town which will be
.acccssihle in winter
road.

Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Longley,
who own the farm to which the
cabin will be moved, are Grinnell
graduates. Miss Andersen point
ed out that neighboring hills will

ble during the winter months and
a grove of trees will invite pic-
nics m the spring and fall,

Taking the reful‘nishing oi the
cabin as a club project. the Hon-
or G girls plan to earn money,
for materials and do the redec-
orating themselves. In a few
weeks, after the cabin has been
‘insiilated for winter use, it will
be available to groups of girls for
overnight parties. 1

Miss Andersen said that allYI
girls can arrange tor the use of
the Honor G cabin, providing they
take with them an Honor G meme
bar or a certified senior, approv—
ed by Dean Evelyn Gardner, The
cabin accommodates ten persons,
and a fee of twenty-five cents per
girl is the only charge.

use of the lace handkerchief
styled her as the lady of sorrows.
Another flower, the red corsagc
acquired during the evening by
the heroine of “Vienna Provincial
#1910," showed that her new-
found love had taken the place
of her prayers, symbolized by the
pl‘ayersbook, in her thoughts.
Thcsc devices increased the in.
terest in Miss Enters' facial ex-
pressions and body movements.
”BalletomanerConnoisscur” would
have profited by a more vivid
symbolizing of underlying cirs
cumstances; the act was obscure
and not very funny. Neither, for
that matter, was the other art-
satire, “Artist's Life."

Costuming and music, for the
most part. were cleverly done,
notably in "Queen of Heaven.”
In long, sombre robes Miss Enters
resembled a painting of a modi-
eval Madonna. even to the awk-
ward sitting position. Howard
Coombs’ introduction. Pnstoralo
by Scarlatti, and the old French
air which accompanied the act
were well-chosen. Although she
did not do much dancing, Miss
Enters had timed her movements
to the rhythm of her accompani-
ments. The prim lady in "Vienr
na Provincial darned her glove in
strict time.

Miss Enters' talent for crystal-
iizing a historical fact into a
brief dramatic scene was conspic-
uous ,in the two numbers inspired
by the Renaissance.

In general the recital offered
an interesting and entertaining
,example of pantomime, an ex.
