In 1858, what would later become
Grinnell College, Iowa College was located
in Davenport, Iowa. In that year, the col—

lege moved from Davenport to Grinnell.

urban river town with saloons, brothels and a street

was also conservative. Antipathy From confederate symt
pathizers caused too much friction for the abolitionist ac-
tivities students desired. This proved the ﬁnal straw for
the trustees who sought a move to optimize the college’s

academic functionality.

LB. Grinnell decided to move the college. which at the time
consisted of “Just the college’s name and a Wagon Full of books,"

Professor Jesse Macy, Political science, not only taught political
science but introduced the idea otinternships for students, spurring
them to evpcriente vanous employment opportunities, not only for

the institution's failure to respond" to eurrcnt events. The

A deﬁning moment in Grinnell’s history was Lhe canosllanon of
ﬁnals and commencement in 1970, a year that saw not only named
in Vietnam but also, that spring, the homhing ofcamhodia and the
shooting at Kent state. Tho faculty made the decision, reasoning
that “therewas too much tension forstudents to study, theydeserved
a much-needed break," Drake said.

The students and faculty Went so far as to make a statement in
the No» Yin/t Titan in May of that year. it read: “We vigorously
condemn the recently intensified aggressive action ofthc United states
in Cambodia and Vietnam and the acts ofofrieial repression so obvi-
ous in recent days at Kent state and oLher universities." Some stun

Aside from just national and international issues, this period held
its fair share oisctivitm tontstncd with Grinnell policy. in Novem-

make rulo trying to stop us?”

on Feb. 5, 1969, students disrohed to protest the misogyny of
payday magazine in a dorm lounge rally. While the |solated act of
rebellion may not have di-.iwn much mention, it gained widespread
notoriety when several studcnu were taken to court and forced to

testify against their peers. One student

Drake admitted feeling serious pres-
sure from the student body during his
term as president from 1979 to 1991.
While the politiul dissent wcsn’t as active
nationally as it had been in the ‘605 and
‘70s, Grinnellians continued to work on
political issues. Students insisted the col-
loge remove its financial investments from corporations in south
Africa, because ofits policy ofraeial aptrtheid.

Drake totalled one instance in the early 80s when students orgrt
ni‘lied outside of Gardner Lounge in an attempt to let their distaste
for corporations in South Africa be heard. Eventually crinndlians
were sutussful and the college “divested many oftheirstoeks in busi»
nesses that supported the apartheid regime," Drake said.

and lack oftiaditional social outlets like a Greek system common to
many state colleges and universities—as not only inhibitors to a
