i admit, there are aspects of
college life that Ifind annoyingTake
classes, for instance, 1 realize, of
course, that there are people who
find their classes endlessly fasciimt'
rng, who hang on their professor’s
every word, and who then type topi—
ous notes into their personal laptops
for future reference and enioyment.
Sometimes, when I am feeling esper
cially ornery, i insert these people's

an unfortunate tendency to lead to
majors, which lead to the inevitable
conclusion that this $80,000 liberal
arts education will be a direct link to
your ruture rarne, fortune, and glory
in the fast raod industry.

i am not bitter about this, In
fact, it was just the other day that i
decided to declare my major, after
my tutorialadyiscrgently mentioned
that all of the other students in my
tutorial haddeclared monthsenrliet,

trons. It took only six or seven folr
low-up email messages for me to
pick up on the hint.

The realization that i had to
declare caused some soul—searching
on my part, since my classes had led
me to no particular direction. My
favorite classes thus far have been
those With titles such as “Chemistry
is Everywhere" along With the corre—
sponding math courses, "Statistics is
Everywhere" and “Calculus is Every.
where." (The latter, Imightadd, is in
sharp contrast to its 131 counterpart,
“Calculus is Nowhere") If they had
an introductory course mawt, l‘d be
set.

English, however, seemed to be
a reasonable alternative. Not only
did a major in English give me the
righttosneercondescenriingly at less—
er majors (i e.: all of them) and to
express my angst by wearing all black
for weeks at a time; it also allowed
me to avoid classes which required
“right answers." (Since I still do not
understand concepts brought up by
Mr. Wizard with any regularity, l
figured science was definitely the
wrong direction for me.)

In addition, English maiotshave
a very skewed view of reality, which

leadsto highly entertainingclassdis—
cussions, mostof which concernsex.
(i.e., Typical Haughty English Mayor
statement: “Well, the handout you
gave us is clearly Freudian, express—
ing the latent desire of the author to
have sexual relations with his moth»
er. ." The class then sits in
embarrassed silence, wondering who
in“ be brave enough to point out
that the “handout" referred to is the
syllabus.)

Finally, after determining my
course of ZICEIOn. l headed to the
registrar to pick up my declaration
form. The secretary handed me a
pink sheet of paper with a place for
my name and two signatures. I was
incredulous, “This is itl”I asked. ”it's
harder to get asack lunch than it is to
declare a major?" l was astounded. l
stood pensively for a moment, then
picked up 14 more declaration forms
(ironically, the exact percentage of
times that they've gotten my sack
lunch tight), and walked out the
door. Just in case

Besides, I’ve always thought
McDonald's had an undertone of
angst. With a hamburglar in black
and a guy named ”Grimace,” I think
l'll fit right in.
