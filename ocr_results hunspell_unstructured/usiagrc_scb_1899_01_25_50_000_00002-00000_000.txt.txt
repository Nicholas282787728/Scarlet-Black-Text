THE MANAGER of the baseball
team of the University of Mine»
sota has written our manager
looking toward an annual base-
ball game between the two insti-
tutions. The annual football
game that has taken place so rage
ularly tor a number of years is a
complete success in every way.
The triends and supporters at
Iowa College teams as well as the
players would be strongly opposed
to its being discontinued. Tliere
seemsno reason why an annual
baseball game would not com
mand like popularity.

THERE HAS been considerable
complaint or late troni out of town
subscribers in regard to the receipt
of SCARLET AND BLACK. We have
received numerous letters saying
that the paper is a day or so late
in its arrival at its destination.
We greatly regret that this is so.
but on only one or two occasions
do we think that the blame rests
at the SCARLET IND BLACK olﬁce.
If there is any delay we are conﬁ»
dent that it is in the postoFﬁce dc-
partment. We are trying, how-
ever, to trace down the cause of
the tardiness in the receipt of the
paper and hope that we will be
able to remedy it before many
days.

Om: or the surest signs that
students have an interest in their
college life. is the number and
quality at their college songs. In
this respect Iowa College is unus-
ually tortunate. Two songs es~
pccially, the "Scarlet and Black,”
written by Mrs. R. G. Cole, and
“Our College is Our Castle,” by
Paul Peck, ’97, have been genera
ally accepted, and alesuiig bythe
Glee Club as pre-emiiieiitly our
college songs; while others or a
lighter nature, while not so widely
known, are popular and lainiliar

, to the students.

During the past
few years it has been the custom
of the Glee Club to introduce at
the home concert songs or a more
local character, ranging all the
iiiay lroni mild “roasts" to linnior-
ous parodies. These productions
have been written sometimes by
members of the club, sometimes
by interested outsiders. This
year the torch of genius has not
been burning very brightly, and
the club is still in need of such 2|
song. it has been decided to give
all the students an opportunity to
show their practical abilities along
this line. The club iiil‘l be glad
to receive any contributions of a
patriotic or humorous character,
and anything ot merit will be used
at the home concert. It is hoped
that by opening the ﬁeld to all
the students. rather than to the
tow, that a higher grade of songs
may be obtained, and that they
may become more closely associ»
ated \vllh our college lite.
