Golfers Vie For MWC Title;
Knox Named Top Contestant

By John Smith
Glinnell’s golf team, enjoying its finest season in 10
yeals, left yesteiday fol Galeshulg, Ill and the confelence
meet which opened this morning. The Pioneers have a
6m 9- 2 lecord this spling against sevelal tough teams and
tollential downpoul's Coach Ilv Simone says, “If we play
0111 best, we could take the confelencc title ”

Knox is undefeated and has
again been given the favorite's
spot. They will have three regs
ulars back from last year’s
championship team. The Pio-
neers likewise have three vets
erans, Jim Anderson, Jim Gab.
rielson and Phil Nelson back
from last years quintet which
brought Grinnell a fourth place
finish. This trio will be well
supported by capable sopho-
mores Dave G05: and Denny
Collis.

The snvashers, the only
conference team to beat Grin-
nell this season, will have the
advantage of defending their
title on their home course,
The conference meet will be
a as hole affair with the best
iaur scores counting for each
team. (lo-captain .lim Ander-
son commentcd on the meet
by saying, “I would guess that
n 36 hole total of around 620

. would be low enough to win,"
‘The scoring during the year
has been well balanced with
each of the five men sharing
equally. “Buzz" Goss has led
the scoring which is based on
three points per match. Ander-
son's par 70 against Cornell was
the best 18 hole total recorded
this season. Nelson had the best
total on the home course with
a 72 against Omaha 1:.

The outlook for next spring
appears good as two freshmen
will probably be moving up to
join three returning golfers,

Wednesday afternoon the
Pioneers tied a strong Drake
team lye-m. Nelson, Ander—
son and 5055 won their match-
es. Nelson had a 75, “Andy"

shot an 80, and “Buzz” cal-d-
ed a 78.

Student interest in our golf
team has not been encouraging.
We have had an opportunity to
see some good golf within walk-
ing disLance of the campus, yet
the total ”gallery" for this
springs three home meets has
been 5 persons. Some excuse can
be fabricated from the fact that
the tee time for the first nine
holes was too early to allow
some students to attend classes.
The home meets were not pub-
licized sufficiently to stimulate
many fans. We may have missed
our chance to see this year’s
conference champslll

SPECIAL MWC RELEASE--

One of the closest
least predictable meets in
years is the forecast for the
annual Midwest conference
track and field champion-
ships to be held at Mon—
mouth college today and to-
morrow. Aside from a unani-
mous conviction that Knox
and 002 will finish next-to-
last and last, there is no agree-
ment as to the probable winner
or as to the order in which the
teams will place. Grinnell, Cor-
nell, Ripon and Carleton have
all been picked to lead the pack.

The Pioneers of Grinnell are
the defending champs, while the

Cornell Rams led Midwest
teams at the Chicago Invitation-

n1 indoors; the two teams have
met twice in the triangular
meets this spring and each has
one victory over the other. The
Ripon Redmen are undefeated
outdoors and have won their
victories by substantial margins.
The Carls are harder to figure,
but most experts pick them
among the top three. Since the
Oles lost a dual meet to their
crosstown rivals by only nine
lpoints, the feeling here is that
1 St. Olaf should be listed among
the possible champions. Also, the
host team, Monmouth, second-
place winner last spring, must
rate as a dark horse. Lawrence
seems destined to finish just
ahead of Knox and Coe.

Cornell: The Rams as usual
are strong in the sprints with
Chuck Bray and Jerry Moore
sure to finish high in the 100
and 220 along with Dick Paul
in the 440. John Hinck could
better his fifth place in the
low hurdles last year, Moore
has recorded the best broad
jump distance in the confer—
ence this spring, both Harold
Barnett and Joe Fitch may
place in the pole vault, and
the i-iilltoppers should talre the
mile relay.

Grinnell: John Marsh will be
defending his title in the 220,
although both Moore and Bray

i have recorded faster times this

spring. Marsh also finished sec-
ond in the 100 last year. The
Pioneers have strong entrants
in the 440 (Bill Elliott and Det
Abel), the 880 (Noel Bacchus
and John Welden>, the mile
(Welden), the two mile (Larry
Schaleger), both hurdles (Joe
Conley), and the high jump

(George Mchmsey and George
Susens). Sam Petroff will de—

fend his javelin title and should
also place in the shot and discus.

Ripon: The Redmen have a
crop of talented sophomores to
go with junior Jim Higgins, who
placed third in both hurdles last
year. if Higgins recovers from
a polled muscle, he and. sopho-
more Bob Osiewalski could
sweep the hurdles. iOsiewalski,
with a 9.9. also figures to score
in the 100. Ripon’s other sopho-
more stars are Don Tomczak in
the shot and discos, Pete Kasr
son in the javelin and pole vault,
and Larry Larson in the two
mile.

Carleton: The earls have a
defending titlist in Marty Ba-
ker in the 880. Baker should
be well supported by Ed Luf-
kin and Norm Miner in the
440, Lynn Kratve in the broad
jump, and Phil Schmid in the
pole vault.

St. Olaf: Sophomore Dennis
Runck gives the Oles a one—man
track team; Runck may enter
the sprints, the jumps, and the
pole vault. Larry Shaw ran
second to Carleton’s Baker in the
239 last spring. other potential
point winners are John Nielsen
in the dashes, Arnie Nelson in
the 440. Duane Brekken in the
broad jump, Norm Sauvage in
the hurdles, and Loren Rendahl
in the pole vault.

Monmouth: The Scots have
seven place-winners back from
last year: Bruce Brawdy in the
two mile, Don Graham in the
mile and half mile Leonard
Gibb in the high jump, John
Baumann in the 440, Tad Yarde
in the discus, and Bob McKee
in the high hurdles.

Lawrence: The Vikings have

This afternoon the prelimi-
nary events of the 1957
Midwest conference track
meet got under way at Mon-
mouth, 11].

In a contest which will be
close and intense, the Grin-
nell squad will try to retain
its 1956 Conference champion
title in the face of strong chal-
lenges from eight other confer-
ence teams. The outcome should
be most fiercely contested be
tween Grinnell, Ripon, Cornell,
Carleton and st. Olaf.

An Is-man team under
Coach Archie Unruh, with a
2»2 record in ﬁnal meets, will
rely on its strength in the
hurdles, distance, and weight
events in its final effort this
season.

Sam Petroff’s prowess in the
javelin and shot put should stand
the team in good stead in the
race for points. With the added
incentive of a conference javelin
title to defend, Petroff is ex-
pected to improve on his ‘besl:
throw this year, 201 feet against
Iowa State Teachers last Sat-
urday. Stiff competition is ex-
pected in both these events
from Lawrence, Cornell and
Ripon, all of whom have hurl-
ers capable of zoo-foot throws.

Sprinter John Marsh and
half-miler Noel Bacchus, both of
whom were winners against
isTC, have been improving
steadily throughout the season.
Their performances should 313
feet the outcome of the meet
considerably. Marsh, whose
toughest opponents will he Cor-
nell’s Bray and Ripon’s Osie<
walski, both of whom have
returned times of 9.9 in the 100-
yd. dash this year, will have his
work cut out to place in this
event

Bacchus will be running
against last years first and
second place winners, Marty
Baker of Carleton and Shaw

0! St. Olaf, together with
new competition from Law-
rence and Cornell.

Favorites for the low-hurdles
title will be Grinnell’s Joe Cons
lay and Cornell’s Dick Paul, but
in the high hurdles Bob Osiewal.
ski of Ripon, who has lbeen
timed in 14,6 for this event
earlier this year, is expected to
win comfortably.

Distance men Larry Schale—
ger and John Welden must
contribute points in their
events it the possible narrow
margin of victory is to be
achieved, The strong competi-
tion in these events will in-
clude Carleton's Earl Neil,
1956 winner of the mile-run
and third place winner in the
two mile run.

Every point that can be pick-
ed up in the other events will
be important: The mile relay
team of Welden, Bacchus, Denv
nis Covault and Bill Elliott
could place second in a tight
field behind Cornell; Bob and
George Mchmsey in the broad
jump and high jump respective—
ly; George Susens in the high
jump; Elliott inthe 440-yd.dash:
and Burdette Abel, Tom Castles
and Dick Thomas are all poten-
tial point—getters. The winners
of the 1957 Midwest conference
track meet will know they earn-
ed it.

only one point-winner return.
ing from 1956: John Winsor in
the shot and discu. If Law-
rence is to go anywhere, Win-
sor will have to get ion of
help from Tom Kliughiel in
the sprints and broad jump,
Ted Sutherland in the mile
and half mile, nave Mullnrd
in the 830, Tom nowell in the
22», and Carl Schwendlel- in
the javclin.

Knox: Trevor Winebright
(shot put), Pat Lynch (440), and
Jim Spence (are) scored for the
Siwashers last spring. Coach
Dean Trevor hopes for help from
Tad Donovan in the mile and
Paul Hohe in the two mile.
