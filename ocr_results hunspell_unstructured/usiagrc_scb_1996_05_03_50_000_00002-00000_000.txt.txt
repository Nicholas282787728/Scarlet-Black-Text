“I propose to examine how the
concept of ahimsa affects eating

ASIA protests lack of space, curriculum, administrative support, continued from p. 1

sponsibility of developing an Asian
American curriculum and ﬁnding
faculty to the students. Jacobsclaims
that the administration has told
ASIA they must Justify a program to
the following inorder to establish an
Asian American program at Grin.
nell: the Englishdepartmentandfao
ulty. the head of relevant depart—
ments, the dean. the minority schol—
ars program and the Consortium for
strongerMinority Presence. “This is

unreasonable to expect from under—
graduate students.” said Jacobs.

Jacobs especially questions the
reason for having to contact the
consortium. According to Jacobs
the responsibility of the Consortium
is to hire our faculty of color. He
claims that if the Consortium were
doing its ioh, ASIA would not have
tocontact this groupinthe firstplace.

Special Assistant to the Fresh
dent Frank Thomas described the

allegations thatstudents were responr
sibleforhiringfacultyaswrong. “The
faculty is always actively seeking [to
recruit] Asian American faculty and
anyone else; we have never asked for
student recommendations," Tho—
mas said. He also said the relative
scarcity of Asian American materi»
als has made the topic difficult to
include in the curriculum.

After receiving a letter outlin—
ing ASIA’s dissatisfaction with the

college‘s treatment of Asian Ameri—
cans, Prcsident Pamela Ferguson
wrote back to Jacobs to set up a
meetingrimerotaikwithASIAahout

Jacobs adds, “This move for
changing the curriculum and also for

Asian students going for their own.
This world is a diverse world and this
country is a diverse country-and if

Jacobs believes that “incotpcr
