Track Team

Ready for
Coe Mee’r

Unique Features

To Be Tested
On Saturday

By Clark Smith

Ideal weather conditions has
proved to be the necessary tonic
to round the Pioneer track squad
into shape for their dual meet
with Coe on Ward field at 2 p. m,
Saturday.’

The meet Saturday is uniquein
several features. All running
events are in the form of relays
and the field events will be
judged on the basis of the total
distance of the two best efforts
on the part of the entrants for
their respective teams, One point
will be given for winning each
event while none will he given
for placing second.

All Around Strength

Under this system, emphasis
falls entirely upon general all
around strength of the squad in
each of the events, The ineet
will depend upon squad performs
ance and not the ability of a few
select men.

Two Events

No man will run in more than
two events under present plans
and it is likely this decision will
hold, according to Duke.
In the schuttle hurdle relay, Duke
must select three timber-toppers
from Hayward, Baichly, Luther
and Pfohl to run in that event.
The mile team is even more un-
certain, Paul Beck being the only
runner who has definitely been
selected to compete in that race.

Special Race

it was necessary to run a spe-
cial race Monday to determine
the fourth man for the twoq—nile
relay team. Randall Mortimer
showed considerable improvement
to be selected to run a half mile
in that race along with Pedersen,
Seeger and Schlotterbeck.

The mile relay also presents a
problem to Coach Duke, as he
must select four men from Cran-
ny, Crossman, Luther, Hagan and
Scnlotterbeck to run. There are
likely to be some last minute
changes in the half mile relay but
at present, a combination of Keat-
ing, Applequist, Pfohl and Stry-

dent of the Honor “G" club.
Apprenticeship

The campus social‘rchairman is
usually elected as assistant social
chairman in his sophomore year
and serves a year‘s apprentice-
ship iinder the social chairman,
Spence said. He automatically
takes office as social chairman
his senior year.

The assistant social chairman
will not be on the preliminary
ballot, Spence explained, because
the Student Council selects the
nominees for that office. VHe will
be elected by students Monday
night.

Student Auditor

Candidates for the position of
student auditor are to be nomr
nated, upon recommendation of
the Student Council, by a commit-
tee consisting of the dean of
men, the treasurer of the college,
the retiring president of the
Council and the retiring student
auditor.

Two men and two women will
be nominated for both chapel and
pop committees Thursday night.

Suggestions

Spence pointed out

that the

'Studellt Council, realizing the dif-

ficulty of nominating candidates
under such conditions, and also to
avoid haphazard voting. has rec-
ommended a number of lndlvitls
uals whom it feels capable of
holding such positions to be placed
on the nominating ballot.

Spaces will be left, however,
for anyone to suggest any other
candidates who might have been
left out, Spence explained.

He stated that the two highest
in each of these classifications

her is working together.
Only Certaintirs

Only certainties appear to be
the 44o-yard relay beam of Keat-
ing, Luther, Strykei- and Apple-
quist and the medley relay team
consisting of Crossman, Cranny,
Hagan and Seeger,

In the javelin throw, Hayward,
Sampson, Baichly and Blank are
all untried men of unknown qual-
ity.

True, Shepherd, Sampson and
Hayward will vie for honors in the
discus, and the pole vault is left
in the hands of Robinson and

 

Hayward.
