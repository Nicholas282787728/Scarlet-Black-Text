After months of rigorous training,
personal sacriﬁces and spirited com-
petitions, the Grinnell College men's
and women‘s swim teams have ﬁ-
nally come face-to-face with their
ﬁnal challengegthe Midwest Con-
ference championship meet at Coe
this weekend.

Both Pioneer squads are expected
to ﬁnish in the upper echelons of the
ﬁnal standings, but in regard to the
overall MWC Crown, both teams
have settled into underdog roles,
Luckily, the Pioneers are not only
comfortable in the underdog seat,
they thrive on the challenge. “This
is what we’ve been waiting for all
season," exclaimed Coach Erin
Hurley. “Everybody's psyched and
ready to go!" ‘

On the women‘s side the Pioneers
face a tough race for first place. Af—
ter the top three squads the talent
level in the conference drops off con—
siderably, so the Mad Ducks are
looking at a threerway race for the
title with Lake Forest and Lawrence.

Lake Forest is considered the
cream of the crop with Lawrence a
close second. But the Pioneer
women remain undaunted. looking
to steal the conference crown from
the favorites. The women‘s squad
has a fairly young lineup, with ale
most half the conference roster be
ing ﬁrst-year students. This will
make leadership and experience

from senior captains Natasha Vasey,-

Morgen Cheshire and Melanie
Wyder even more crucial, The Mad
Ducks not only need scoring from
their elite swimmers, but also from
the second tier of swimmers who
must scrape together crucial points.

“Everyone needs to score in this
meet," remarked Coach Hurley.
“I‘m counting on our seniors to mos
tivate the younger swimmers to
strive for their best times. If we can
steal points here and there, we have
a legitimate shot at the tille."

The men also have been relegated
to underdog status, Lake Forest is
the odds-on favorite, but there prom-
ises to be an interesting threerway
battle for second among Grinnell.
Coe and Lawrence. Coe has already
defeated the Pioneers three times this
season, so the Mad Dogs are look—
ing for vindication as well as a high
ranking in the final ch standings.

The men's squad is considerably
smaller than the women‘s team, so
the men need some high scores from
everyone in order to be competitive
in the three»day weekend meet. In
particular the Pioneers look for a
topnotch performance from senior
Derek Fimmen who is favored to win
both diving events. Also, freshman
Nathan Lueck should ﬁgure promir
nently in the scoring mix. “The men
have a tremendous history behind
them,“ mentioned Coach Hurley,
“They understand the importance of
this meet and they know what it takes
to win. Our numbers aren't quite
where we would like them in terms
of personnel, but I feel that we can
still compete with the top teams."

The championship is a grueling
threerday affair that invariably saps
a lot of energy out of both the
coaches and the swimmers. Coach
Hurley is not concerned about the un-
derdog status. “We just need to re-
lax and swim our races," she said.
“We know what we are capable of.
Now wejust need to prove it to the
conference."

When the Grinnell College
women's basketball team took the
court Tuesday against Cornell, it had
only one purpose: break their 20.
game losing streak. with strong ofr
fensc and improved defense, the Pioe
neers downed COIT181162>55 for their
ﬁrst win ofthe season.

‘Cornell entered the contest with
only one win. The Rams had beaten

last week and I tllink both teams are
getting the most out of their talent.
This should be a good competitive

Sophomore point guard Jeff
Clement led all scorers with 42
points. Schubert was the only other
Pioneer in double figures; he had

It’s fun, it’s deadly, it’s lacrosse
Lacrosse club team gets record turn out

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK

The bodies, glistening of sweat,
run towards the small white ball as
old men walk onto the field staring
at the seemingly chaotic and savage
game before their eyes. Suddenly,
they turn away from a sport that
seems so foreign and uncivilized, and
return to their world of basketballs
and running shoes,

To be able to enjoy the game of
lacrosse one only needs to drop the
wall of preconceived notions. Hisr
torically, lacrosse is a centuries old
sport that has its roots in the Native
American culture of Upstate New
York. According to team captain
Brad Sikorski ‘97, in the beginning
the game was played without bound-
aries and to the death. While death
is not still part of the game, the un-
heralded players on this relatively
unrecognized club team certainly do
not seem to have many boundaries.
They are unsung athletes playing to
their utmost the strategy tilled sport
oflacrosse.

“I was good for’l'exas standards,”
calmly and bashfully proclaims Arrel
Gray ‘00, He never told me he was
on the Texas state championship
team. but masked by his shy persona
is a man who walks onto the ﬁeld
with a devotion and love for his sport.
Gray emphasizes that lacrosse is “re-
ally a thinking game“ but is ’not

ashamed to admit that its “fun kick-
ing ass.“ This year Gray is part of
whatcorcaptain John Hjelm ‘98 con-
siders possibly the “best team
Grinnell has put together." With a
number of first years who have
played competitively in places like
Colorado and Texas and with a
strong core ofveterans, the team will
be a solid competitor this year. How»
ever, despite the promise of this years
team, first year Colin Guthrie ex-
plained that he had “very little ex-
pectation."Sikorski concurred in his
hopes for the season when he set the
simple goal for the team to “Win a
game." After all, the team has de-
fined itself by its ability to enjoy the
sport on a both competitive and re-
laxed level. l-ljelm described 121»
crosse as the “most laid back sport
at Grinnell." Their practice is usu-
ally twice a week and consists of a
number of drills followed by intense
scrimmaging. Sikorski talks ofhow
the sport's ﬂexibility is what makes
this club sport unique, adding that if
it was a recognized sport it would
“take the fun away." In fact, as a
critical part of enjoying themselves
the team often organizes weekly bar
practices “Who’s the best drinker
on the team," I ask I-Ijelm. l-Ie res
sponds, “we’d probably all vote our-
selves the best."

But being on the team is ulti»
mately not about bar practice. As
sophomore Dan willms explained, “I

didn‘t get a chance to do a lot of
drinking With the team last year."
Yet, looking intoWillms chilled eyes
one can see his excitement to get out
onto the ﬂoor and play in the first
scrimmage of the year.

By the end of February this exr
citemcnt will be put to the test, when
the team begins to challenge other
tennis in a couple of indoor tourna-
ltlenls, Then, after spring break the
schedule picks up whcn they will
play at least three outdoor tourna-
ments. In most oflhcse tournaments
they ate dwarfed by teams that are
coming from schools many times the
size of Grinnell such as [he Univer-
sity ofNebraska, Last your, however.
they gave Iowa Statea scare, and this
year they hope to surpnse a couple
teams. Despite the prospects. Hjelm
is still short on players and is look
ing for people ofany skill level, who
would like to have fun.

This year the lacrosse team is
called the "Lemmings" because
l-IJeIm says, “we are supposed to fol-
low cach olhcr over cliffs and what
not."

Afterintervicwmg them,Isit back
in a chair on the sidelines and watch
the bodies violently batter for the
ball, silently drinking up their sport’s
excitement. Even as little boys wuh
basketballs run through the ﬁeld and
old men lap up this savage excilc-
merit, the Lemmings keep all chas-
ing their white ball.

 

situation for both of us," commented
Coach Jenny Wood before the game,

“The games this week are imporr
tant to us because it is the end of our
inrstate rivalry with Coe and Cornell
in the Midwest Conference," said
Wood. Both schools are joining the
Iowa Conference next fall.

In their only game last week, the
Pioneers lost to Knox, 59730. “I
thought our defense was very good
in the first half. We had some trouble
on the defensive glass during the sec-
ond half, though. We need to show
more patience offensively. When we
are patient, we have some success,"
evaluated Coach Wood.

Sally Goodspeed led Grinnell
scoring with 11 points. She hit five
of 16 from the field, including one

three-pointer, Mandi I-lill grabbed 10
rebounds but got off only five shots.
“For Mandi lhc key statistic is shots
attempted Again. some patience in
the offensive set would have helped,"
noted Wood.

. The play of senior Tina Popson
caught her coach’s eye. Coach Wood
noted that she felt Popson had a

"‘great game" in terms of hustle and

rebounding. “We need Tina to con-
tinue her strong play lhis week,” of-
fered Coach Wood,

The coach maintains that in order
to achieve a win the team needs at
least four players to have solid
games, "Right now we ate getting
good efforts out of two players a
game. We need a few more players
to come along," sllc concluded.

It’s tennis time! -

neers got seed times and more ex
perience for the Midwest Confer-
ence championships at Knox in two
weeks,

Holly Kilmer had the highest ﬁnr
ish for Grinnell, placing fifth in the

letes. -

After competing at the Univer-
sity ofSouth Dakota and the Uni»
versity of Northern Iowa, Freeman
continues to be pleased Wth the im-
provement of the team, “We are
getting better. No question about
il. I’mreally lookingforward to the
conference meet. Things should go
fine for us ifwc stay healthy."

At the University of South Da-
kota the Pioneer distance medley
relay team had terrific success. The
quartet, comprised of runners Neil
Gipson ‘99. Nick Lanna ‘99, Brain
Rebar ‘97 and Dan Madigan ‘00,
finished first in a ﬁeld of Division
11 teams, Gipson ran the 1000»
meter leg in a time of 236.8, the
fastest time in the conference.

At UNI, the rest of the team
showed improvement and ran
strongly. Freeman cited the tniddle
distance runners as particularly
strong. In the 600-meter run
Grinnell received a fine perfor-
mance front Malt Rhoades ‘99.
Freeman also had praise for Ted
Massey ‘00 and Josh Ward ‘97.
