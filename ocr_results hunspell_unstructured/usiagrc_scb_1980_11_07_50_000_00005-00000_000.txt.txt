How well do you know the prols and
resident advisers on campus? If your
answer is not very well. you should conv
slder going to one of the study breaks
set up by the "Prnls and RA s in the
Dorms" program.

This program. run by Doug Gruene-
Wald. is designed to get students and
prols to cross paths in places other than
the classroom. Gruenewald arranges
tor a proi or EA to speak in a certain
hall and all of the students in that hall
and the surrounding halls are invited
via their RA.

Student Affairs recently released a
list oi as proiessors and administrators
who are Willing to participate. All seven
RA's are also available for the study
breaks.

The profs make presentations, lead
discussions. act as panel members, or
Just socialize They otter a diverse set
0! topics, including Joseph Wall on ERA
or the American political scene. Bob
Voertman on energy topics. Sheila Mca
Carthy with slides of the Soviet Union.
and John Harvey on French impres-
sionlsm George Drake and Waldo
Walker will discuss questions ot college
policy. also,

Most dorms have tried the idea this
year and at least one dorm. Langan. is
attempting to hold a regular weekly
study break ieaiuring a dinerent prof
or RA each time. The turnout for these
programs has not been as good as
Gruenewald would like, though, Mostof
the students who go to the study breaks
come from within the hall holding the
break. instead of from the adjoining
halls as well. All of those who have at-
tended seem to have enjoyed
themselves, however. _

It a dorm decides to host one or more
of these profs and administrators. it
will receive $10 to help offset the ex
penses incurred at the study break.
Having the RA 5 there. however. does
not quality a dorm for any extra fun-
ding.

Barb Gaddis. a notorious south cams
pus RA. commented. “These study
breaks are so very successiul (for the
students who attend) because they
allow the student to meet the prots on a
much more informal basis than is
usually possible”

November 7. WED

trustee meeting went very well. The
president stated his goal of wanting "to
make Grinnell one of the best liberals
arts colleges in the country." and the
trustees were apparently receptive and
enthusiastic to this idea. Discussions
were concentrated in the areas of
liberal vs. professional education. Grin~
nell‘s strengths and weaknesses. enrolls
ment predictions. the quality oi the stu
dent body and iaculty. and the college's
financial luture.

The trustees suggested that Grinnell
should perhaps build up its image by
projecting the college’s strengths to the
public more positively However.
Drake affirmed that he is not a P,R.
man. and stated that such promotion is
"not crinneirs style." He preferred to
"let the world find out about us,"
Nonetheless. the trustees wxll hire a
firm to analyze the college's "market"
lie: what do prospective students

think ot Grinnell College'll.

Also discussed at the meeting was the
planned renovation/expansion ol the
college’s library. According to Drake,
the school will absolutely outgrow Burl~
ing within the next three to four years.
Drake made trips with three represene
tative trustee members to Williams.
Swarthmore, and Haverford Colleges
e schools comparable to Grinnell. He
said it became evident to all involved.
that Burling is an inadequate facility.

The new plan. which will have a
minimum cost of $2 million, will
radically alter the present design and
layout of the library. Space will be
allocated for up to 500.000 volumes and
well over 10.000 square feet of ﬂoor
space will be added. A linal decision
should be made on the library's renova~
tion design by the end of the coming
academic year. with construction
beginning in 1982.
