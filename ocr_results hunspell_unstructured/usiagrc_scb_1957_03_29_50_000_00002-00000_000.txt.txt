of those who

profess to be “jazz-lovers.” If
jazz is an art—form, why isn’t
it treated as such by Arm-
strong, who is highly touted as
the "king of jazz"? if he is the
foremost exponent of pure jazz,
why does he cater to the hand
clapping, headajerking collegiate,
allow an ejaculation like “Don’t
he play sexy?" in the middle
of a piano solo, and encourage
a drummer who adds stumbling
super-theatrics to his playing?

mm the nonproductive
violence that always begins a
bull-semiou, my iriends gave
me a short lecture. From this
I gather that there are three
kinds of jazz concerts, and I
think_it might be illuminat—

The most arttul of the three
types is the concert for the
sake of jazz appreciation, like
"Jazz at the Philharmonic," pre-
sented in Chicago. it included
Gene Krupa. Lester Young. Roy
Eldridge, Ella Fitzgerald, and
other greats. and the audience
listened as if to Toscanini, un-
til one observer, during a vocal
by Ella Fitzgerald, stood in his
seat and shouted “I'm coming,

Ella baby!" The curtain was

Opén Meeting Discusses Possibilities
for “Integration" Of Women's Hails

All open meeting to discuss integrated housing was held

in Main lounge after dinner

last night, Recommendations

for the proposed system were made by six chairmen who
gave committee reports based, on recent surveys taken

throughout the Quadrangle.

The committee on architecture presented‘a quota sys-
tem for each hall which provided that Mam have 42%

immediately lowered, and
impresario, Norman Granz, an.
nounccd that the performance
would end if the disturbance
was repeated.

Another type of jazz pcrfol‘mr
ance is the backstreet, base.
mentrdive, whiskey—and.gin jam
session, so often pictured by
Hollywood, Serving as a trams
ing ground and a means ofvlive-
lihood for the serious struggling
jazz musician, some of the ses—
sions draw audiences who come
for appreciation ot the music in
an atmosphere like that in which
jazz was born.

Then there is the Louis Ari-n-
strong coliegc concert, aimed at
entertainment through the pres
sentation of Armstrong's pow-
derful personality, his white
handkerchief, and the massive
Velma Middleton, The audience
reaction, on the whole, is that
of a completely ignorant mob.
a mob that thinks head-nodding
and hand—clapping the only
proper reaction to jazz. Persons
who are attempting an appreci—
ation of jazz are actually rc-
pcllcct by the people in the
audience, and the music itself
is lost in noise. 1 ﬁnd it hard
to believe that the musicians
enjoy playing to such an audi-
ence. but, as i said betore, Arm»

joyed most at the music, and
the vocals. too. But after my
enlightenment, I feel as if i
enjoyed them outside the art
that jazz is supposed to lie.
And I can't help feeling that
those who are serious about
jazz as an art, and Louis
Armstrong himself, are hin-
dering rather than helping

freshmen, Cleveland 37%: James,
Haines and Read 38%, and
Loose 42%.

Seventy-nine per—cent of the
women are opposed to static
integrated halls, They favor a
quota for each class per hall.
To insure some good rooms
for incoming freshmen, the
suggestion was made to draw
50% of their rooms in each
hall before upperclass women
made their choices.

The committee on leadership
possibilities set up the house
councils as the ideal central body
within the halls. It was suggest-
ed the council meet once each
week to discuss hall problems
including many of those now
taken to the League Board
meetings. if everyone except the
student council representative
would serve. only one semester.

tunity to grow in leadership,

The majority of the women
favor the present prepping

hall system, considerable
stress to acquaint the {resh-
meu women with the rest of
their classmates would be
necessary. The length oi prep.

Did you notice that the front

Those who had an active part
in planning the concert deserv-

why begin drawing class lines
on the Grinnell campus while

Adds New Position

The Board of Religion met
Wednesday night to discuss
proposed changes ill its con-
struction. A committee had

gestions for cutting down the
positions on the board, but the

merely to rearrange the duties
oi the different committees and
to create a new position.

The board members voted to
keep the same number of inerti-
bers and follow the following
resolutions: ‘

L The publicity committee
will retain its three members.
Their duties are; to be defined
clearly, with one member de-
voting his time specifical’iy to
VVUS publicity during the
drives.

with suggestions for improve-
ment. These are due by the time
the next members are elected.

3. The duties’or the hospital-
ity committee and the YWCA
representative are (I) be com-
bined. The position left will be
devoted to a newly created
member:

4. This member will assist
the various denominational
groups on campus in cmtlng
enthusiasm and a strong pro»
gram, The Inter-Faith group
will still maintain its repre-

.sentative. it was also sug-
gested that the presidents of
the different church groups he
invited to attend board meet-
ings as non-voting members.

The speciﬁc changes suggest-
ed were:

l. Publicity _ cut down to
two members. one girl and one
boy to distribute posters, blot-
ters. etc. on both north and
south campus.
