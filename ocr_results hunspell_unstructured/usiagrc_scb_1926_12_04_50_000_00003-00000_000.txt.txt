The January issue or the Tanager,
which will be distributed not later
than December 10, has becn declared
by critics to i-cpi-csent one of the best
exampls of the printer's art ever to be
turned out in Grinnell.

The front cover and title pages oi
the January number display, tor the
first time, three lincs of Galldy Hand
tooled type designed [or the Tanagcr
by Frederic W. Goudy, a mail who has
devoted his life to the perfection of
the Roman pi-intcd letter, and who
has carncd as a result of his eflorts.
the distinction ol contributing more to
the printer's art than any man in two
succeeding generations. in a “Note on
Typography," which appear in the Ta-
nager for January, Wayne Gard has
presented an interesting account of
the developmet or modern type, with
especial reference to Mr. Golltly‘s con»
tributions to the art of type designs
ing. .

The appearance of the magazine has
been augmented by the addition of
two linoleum cuts by Dean Stei-rctt.
The literary contributions are of the
usual high degree of interest. being
headed by an intimate sketch of “Sis-
ter Aimee” written especially for the
Tanager by Arthur Moore. The forth-
coming issue of the Tanager does not
slight the celebrities or the home
state, howovcr, as the lowdown on
Iowa's Mussolini also may be had in
l-lerold Hiclt's article on "The Duce
of Iowa Politics." Other contribu-
tions include stories by Margaret
Weishaar and Mildred Onstine, poems
by George Scymore and Miriam Mes
Nally, and a descriptive sketch of
Vachel Lindsay by John Kearns.

“There is some comment that jus-
tice is delayed in our courts today,
hilt sonic things are eien worse than
delay; and tho arrest, trial and cruci-
mum at Jesus Chr t exeinplilies the
antithesis of delay, too speedy a trial
and execution of sentence. Christ
was or estetl at one o'clock in the
morning and nailed to the cross at
{our o'clock the following afternoon,"
said Edward P. Smith, [oi-pier mayor
01' Omaha and prominent Omaha ate
torney, to the joint meeting of the Cole
lege christian association in A. it. H.
auditorium Thursday night.

Mr. Smith said that the material he
had gathered in tile study of the trial
or Christ train a legal standpoin was
the result ot his leading the Congrer
galiuual mcirs group of Omaha.
Showing a well-founded background
of history and knowledge or
the Bible. Mr. Smith gave a brief
resume of tile local and provincial
government oi that time. He iollowed
this with a 'vid word picture or the
arrest, trial, and cxccution oi thc
Savior.

“The reason we find so few poisons

Manpower.

Four millions of the best man-power of Europe

perished in the Napoleonic

conquests. Military con-

quest is non-creative, while industry is always

creative.

In the last ten years one American manufacturer—-
the General Electric Company—has created machines
having a man-power forty times as great as that of
all the lives lost in the Napoleonic wars.

In the years to come, when the college men and women
of today are at the helm of industry and of the home,

it will be realized more and

more that human energy

is too valuable to be wasted where electricity can do
the work better at lower cost.

cuough to have than death cliiooi

there are a great iiiiiiihei that we can
point out at iiis-t thought. Socrates
was convicted oi treason for teaching
a raise doctrine that was doti-imcntol
lo the Athenian philosophy. u ailes
l u as bchcadcd, a victim of the right
lictwcon himscli and P' liament. Ne-
ver was there a more dramatic trial
than that ol War-on Hastings, who
was accused ot in conduct in thc ina-
iiagement of affairs in lndr Aaron
Burr, an oficcr in the Ame can army,
was tried for treason; Droyhis, a
branch commander, was com-t mar
tialcd for trcason. These men and
their trials are insigniiicant beside
the martyrdom of JcsusChrist."
uuVl‘l‘lilllclll lly Su‘tlrll.

Mr. Smith dcscribedtlie goveiiinient
as that of Rome representing law and
rule by the sword, against that at
Jeru alein, which represented the H
brow race, thcir prophcts and then
church. For the central government
of Rome, Pontlus Pllztte, nephew or
Caesar Augustus, ruled Judca, and
Herod ruled Galilee. Oh the other
hand the Hebrews had a counci
which was called the Sanhedi-in, coin-
hosed of seventy-one members This
was the first representative body ever
held on this earth and was composed
oi twentyrtllree scribes or lawyers,
tweiityuthreo pricts, the same number
or elders or business men, the ev-bigh
priest, the high priest eme in, and
the present high pr st. Thcy had all
the powers of legislative and iudicial
nature. However, the Roman govern-
ment had deprived this body of its
power of lite and death, and this no
played.

Mr. Smith briefly told of the Pass-i

way to Jcrusalcm he was acco
by a crowd of converted follm .
was on this journey that two of the:
most outstanding miracles in Ch '
life were performed and the only one
that was ever performed sol-.ly for
the purpose of impressing the crowd,"
Mr. Smith declared.The speaker then'
described the restoration or the sight
to two blind man, and the raising train
the dead of Lazarus, brothcr of Mary
and Martha.
Trial was Dolaird.

“it was by the tale of tlicsc llappenv
ings that ciapus, the lealcr oi' the
Sanhcdrin, conspired to nnd the life
of Christ.” M Smith continued.
“These men were jealous or Christ
and knew: that their positions were
threatened 't Christ were allowed to
go on t rig. it was that that Cia—
piis said, ‘11. it not better that one man
should die than all or us perish?"
He showed how through bribery they
induced Judas to betray Christ at a
moment when they could arrest him
without tear or the mob. Jesus chi-ist
w arrested after the last Lord’s sup—
per that was held in thc house or
Mar ind taken to the snanhedrin at
one oclock in thc morning. Here is
where the trial that was illegal, ac-
cording to Mr. Smith, took place. |

“The trial or Christ was illcgal ior
thrco reasons," said the former may-
or. “Thc iii-st is, that according to
the Mosaic law, no legal transaction
may take place on a Sabbath or holy
day. This was the iii-st day ol‘ the
Passover and one or thc holy days of
the Jewish calendar. in the second
place, the trial was held within a per-
iod of two hours. The Mosaic law
provides that beforc a conviction or
death can be legal the members of the
Sanhcdrin must spend the night in
prayor, tasting, and meditation he-
twccn the two days necessary to vote
on the guilt of the prisoner, and the
passing of his sentence. The last rea
son is important because the Sanhcd-
i-iri has no power to inflict death on
any one since the Roman government
in crvcd that right.”

in the face or illegality at every
turn, Mr. Smith went on, the Sanhod»
rin convicted Christ on his own cun-
iession of being the son or God. A
tor the sentence of death was or
lloullccd. Christ was taken to Pilate
lor confirmation of the sentence. Pi~
latc acquitted Christ, but sent the mob
ta iierod, who, in turn, sent Christ
back to Pilate for sciitence. Pilate
liccainc intimidated in thc iacc or the
mob as tho bible relates, and said “I
wash my hands of the whole matter;
see ya to it."

Mob Talicv Word Literally.

The men took these words literally
and cruciried Christ. Jesus or Nay .
roth became a victim or a mob lynclle
ii . As a result oi this laxity. Ponti-

 

us Pilate was thrown into prisun by

Tiberius and there died. From the
standpoint oi the Roman Law the
whole proceedingswcrc illcgal, hc (lee
clared.

The law providcs that- the charge
againsta man must be presented in
writing and posted [or three days on
the door of the judgment room, Mr.
Smith stated, and this charge was
not even writtcn.
