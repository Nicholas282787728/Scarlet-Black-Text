The biggest ﬁnancial proposition
ci-innell college has ever handlcd will
be auiiched two weeks iioiri today, af-
ter nearly six months or preparatory
work on the part ol the alumni oi the
college. \ Little has been said about
the campaign around the college, be.
cause it was not felt that the time
was ripe for the work, and because
Lhe‘students were supposed to be busy
making Grinneil live up to her repu
tation as a school of learning

Now the time has come when student
help will be invaluable. The college
students are to be organized, accord-
ing to the plans or, the local district
management, for help in the publicity
and other work in connection with
the campaign. The students will not
be asked to concrihute money, but to
contribute help in the form oi “talking
itup strong” wherever they go) and
to everyone they meet.

Few students at Gi-inucll arc sorry
they came here. Most ct: them are
particularly glad. The success or the
alumni,in their drive for $3,500,000
:or an increased endowment and
building fund will mean the construc-
tion of new science, music, and per-
haps other one arts buildings, a new
gymnasium or two, more dormitory
buildings, the men’s union, and will
mean an increased student body. The
present generation of students are
proud to be here now, and will soon
*become alumni, ready to answer the
call of their alma mater, prouder than
ever of the position Grinncll holds
among other institutions or the world.
and proud to be Crinncllians.

Three millions live hundred thrills
sand dollars is a huge sum for a coir
iege endowment
ever attempted to raise such a sum.

Few colleges have

None anywhere near the size or Grin-
nell have tried it Harvard is now
ﬁnishing a $7,000,000 campaign, but

Harvard is much larger than Gi-inirell.

Gl'ihnell has had two camnaigus OI ,

$500,000 before, one in 1908 and one in
1914. Both were successful because of
the interest and real help and loyalty
on the part 01' the student body at the
time.

Gl'innell projects are successful ber
cause of that traditional spirit of ﬁght.
and well planned ﬁght, handed down
from the famous Iowa Band who

fought so hard to establish the college

and keep it from being destroyed by
. Wind and criticism.

Grinnell has given to ﬁle world
more than Valuer'rcccivetl and is now
out to ask the friends or education
to help it catch up with itself on the
money end.
