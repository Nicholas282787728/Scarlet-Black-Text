At Wednesday’s Joint Board Meeting.
Ali El Saifar, president, discussed the re
cent note to students about alcohol con-
sumption in public. He said that because of
the recent change in Iowa drinking laws it
is important not to consume any alcoholic
beverages in public, and that the ad-
ministration will enforce this rule. Also,
Ali discussed the possible addition of
minors to the academic program. For the
second year in a row, the faculty voted this
down Other academic news included the
reduction in the number of internships be-
ing offered next year. This year there were
47 internships, but the administration
wants to limit this to 35 positions in the
future; students interested in internships
need to start thinking about them now.
