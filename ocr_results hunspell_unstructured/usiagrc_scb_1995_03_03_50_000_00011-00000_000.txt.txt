We would like to inform the campus

Problem of discrimination,
ignorance ignored by most
TheS & B‘s recent publication ofodilori-
alsaddrcssingMultlculturnlism,especially
that written by Chris Pallets, has prompted
me to respond. Since coming to Grinnell
College,lhavcsensodasnongdiscomfort
among the white majority of students
toward students of other “races" or-
ethnictncs. Them is a problem of igno-
mnoe and discrimination on this campus.
I claim that this problem has persisted
because students of the white maioritv

have not shown effort and initiative in
rocogniztng and tackling it; we have not
made this a pn'onty.

Until now, the problem has been all
but ignon-d by most people] know. lam
ashamed to adniitthatl, too,have been lax
aboulexaminlltg my own prejudices and
behaviors, This choice to remain passive
has been possible, and indeed, all too easy
for me, because] am white.

Pallas‘s editorial is honest. He arr
ticulatcs opinions in opposition to
Multiculturalism which are prevalent
among white people; as alarming as drey
arc, those opiiioris must be ideriutiod and
raced itchangeis to be made. By bravely
publishing Palm‘s views. the S (Q B has
(lone the campus ascrvtce' the issues are
out on the table; we can no longer evade
lhetit. AfterreodlngPallas’spioccllalkcd
at length with hiitt, and we managed to
agice on one Lhirtg: his editorial has
sparked dialogue, and that is good, But
olhcrwiso, leniirety disagree with Pallas
0n the issue ol’Multlculttu-ztllsln.

Flillas gives two basic reasons for
why Muiucultuirtlisrnisnota good way to
*‘ciidinersriii’ First. he says, itis “itnpmcn
tical," since “you can‘t iorce people to
loam about other cultures." Using this
logic. he claims that adding classes fo-
cused on minority groups to the Cut‘l‘lcu'
litttt is futile. since the people who really
needtobcedttcntcdnhouttnntontieswould
not take Iliesc classes. Why, I ask, does
Pallas immediately default to the ”funk
ity" excuse? Why does he not go to the
other extreme: yer, students could be
required to take a minorityrfocused class
ortwo. This tequirementwould do all of
us some good, and it would show atrue
commitment to Multiculturalism on the
part of the college.

The second argument Pallas gives
against Multicultumlism is dial “igno-
rance is not the sole source of racism";
mﬂ‘ler, he atmbules racism mostly to hue
mans' “instinctive xenophobia." Iclriim
that we should not accept our xenophobia
as pan of who we are; we should ﬁght
against it It seems to me that this is what
aMulticultural ctrnculurnwould do: edu-
cate us in order to reduce our fear of what
we don’t know or undersuand, We can’t
ignore these fears, they won't go away:
takcalook at onrcunent campus climate,

The editorial then moves on to point
out problems in die implementation ofa
more Multicultural curriculum. Pallas
suggests that classes which are taught

from minority groups’ perspectives arc
dangerous in that tltcy create an ”alter-
centrism." Theseclasses sulldonotfocus
on representing multiplicity,hc says; they
simplydcmand lhalwcsoeissucslhrough
allyffercttl narrow lens. This claim makes
me wonder whether Pztllas has ever actu-
ally taken riminorilyrfocustxl class. Ifhe
had, he would know that having been
raised asmelnbers ofthe dominant white
culture, we are never able to shed our
perspective entirely, in class oranywhere
else. It is ridiculous even to pretend that
teaming a bit about other cultures will

stick."

Pallas complains of “reverse rac-
ism" happening when whites are “ex
cluded from [minonly] houses and orga-
nizations" as aresult oil‘volulile’lry Segre
gation“ on the part of minority groups.
There is an important clarification to be
mndeherc. Majoritymembershave never
been excluded from minoniy houses and
organizitions. as Pallas claims. CBS,
ASIA, SOL, Chrilutzim and other minor:
ily groups ureopen towtyarteinlercslcdin
tlicirconccnts, and ilhasalways been that
way, Therefore, these groups‘ roquestfoi
their own spaces are not “segregation."
From time to time, it is necessary for
members of a minority group to come
together and Slippolt each other, to Japan
talc from the lnLlJOrily cullure for a shon
time. iii a place where they tool comfort-
able. But their cultuml centers are also
places where all students can learn and
have fun. it is not the African-American
students faultthatmostofus have chosen
not to confront our xenophobia. and have
nevcrset footin the BCC. Why can’t We
accept that there are certain things we
can‘t understand about minority peoples
exponenoc, but wecan [still] sympathize,
support and socialize together?

The two ﬁnal paragraphs of theedi-
tonal degrade lntoztclump ofunfoundod,
unprovcn generalizations about both culr
turdl centers and Afﬁrmative Action. ll

sensationalism: where did Fallas get the
ridiculous idea that ‘Vhe administration
points pndefully at the number of ‘colr
ored’ sanimtion workers and Calls the
school multicultural?" It is interesting to
note, although Pallets freely criticizes a
Multiculmmllst approach to the problem
of prejudice and racism, hedoes not offer
an altenrative approach. in my view, the
beginnings of a Multicultural system at

Grinnell have proven to be cffcctrve. I
would liketo thinkthat being taught about
minority perspectives, by teachers who
are members of minority groups, has
