$20 million capital investment near Malcom

 

Fremont Farms plans big
egg-processing facility

By JOHN BREEMER

News editor

Fremont Forms of Oskaloosa will
construct a major egg-processing fa-
cillty over a ﬁve-year period near
Maleom, the company‘s chief exec—
utive ofﬁcer conﬁrmed Wednesday.

The company president, Jim Dean,
met Monday With the Powcshick
County Board of Supervisors to dis—
cuss details of the plan, which repre-
sents a SZOAmIIIion-plus capital invest»
merit and what Dean called “one of the
largest economic improvements ever"
in the county.

When the project is completed in
2002, it is expected to house 2.1 mil-
lion chickens, Sixteen buildings are
planned, each of which will contain
134,000 birds, Dean said.

One building is to be completed this
year. An additional three will be con-
structedin 1999,with fourbcing added
in each ofthe following three years.

A valueadded business

The chickens will not be used for
meat production. Instead, Fremont
Farms plans a value<added business in
which local farmers will sell corn to
the company, which in tum will pro
cess the grain into feed ataniill located
on the farm. That mill will be built in
the fall of 1999 and completed in the
spring of 2000, Dean said.

The company will build its egg-pro
cessing plant in the spring of 2000,
completing it that fall.

The new Industry will process the
eggs on site, separating the yolks and
whites. Those will then either he fros
zen or dricd for further processmg in
Oskaloosa. The products are then to
sold to such businesses as bakeries,
pasta companies, ice crcam makcrs
and others in tlle food industry.

Wllenthcfacilityisiullyoperational
in2002, Dean said, It'santicipatcdthat
it will consume some 50,000 bushels
ofcom per week in the form offectl.
Much ofthat corn is expected to be
purchased from area farmers,

Used locally for fertilizer

In tum, manure generated from the
facility will be spread on farm ﬁelds in
the area. That manure will be in dry
form and Willcausc noodorproblems,
Dean said,

Fremont Farrns‘ current facility ls
located three-fourths ofa mile from
thetownofFremontandhasgcncrated
no complaints about odors ‘or other
problems, Dean said.

“When you handle poultry manure
m dryform, there’snot nearly as much
of an odor problem,” he explained “I
recently had Congressman [Leonard]
Boswell at our facility, and he was
astounded at the lackofodorandﬂles
We make every effort to be a good
neighbor. I wcntto school in Pclla, and

my wife graduated from Oskalcusa
High School. So we're local people "

The facility will not use manure Ia—
goons, but will rely on a form of
composting within the chicken hcuscs
thatactuallydriesthemanure,whiehis
moved out in dump tmcks, Dean said.

Dry manure generated by the plant
will be sold to area farmers for fertll»
rzcr. In fact, Dean said, farmers repre-
senting some 4,000 acres already have
requestedrhattheybeputonrhehstfor
manure applications in Powcshiek
County.

Will build on 80 acres

Dean has a 60—day option to pur—
chase I60 acres of land northwest of
Malcom. The actual facility will be
built on 80 acres.

Fremont Farlns’ current facility
houses 950 laying chickens, and the
complex was built without any state
funding. Dean said that, while he is not
seeking any Iowa Department ofEco-
nomic Development funds for the
Powcshiek County project, “I would
be a little crazy not to take a look at it”
ifit is available,

One prerequisite for the project is
the upgrade ofan cxisuug road to ac-
cornmodatethetractor—trailerstllat will
be hauling in feed ingredients or leav-
ing with eggs and egg products. That is
currently beingconsideredbythc Board
chup'cryisois.

When the feed mill Comes on line at
the Poweshick County location, an
existing mill nt‘ar Oskaloosa will be
closed, Dean said.

‘A very good track record’

Terry Walker of Poweshiek Area
Development (PAD), which has
W01 Red with Dcaii on the local projcct,
said Fremont Famisappearsto have “a
very good track record."

"Thls Will be very good for area
farmers, because they‘ll be paid a pre-
mitunforthcirgrain,"shesaid,“Even~
tually there could be 50 or 60 ncwjobs
for the area."

Fremont Farms is the actual pro-
duction company, but the opeiation
also Will be associated with Oskaloosa
Foods, a company in existence since
the late 19305 that does Fremont's
inarkclingandlheactual processing of
the cggs.

“So We Will add value in Poweshiek
County and add another layer ofvaluc
when the eggs are processed here in
Oskuloosa,” Dean said.

The company will employ a local
labor force, although the size of that
force has yet to he determine and will
increase gradually as buildings are
added over the five-year period.
Oskaloosa Foods currently employs
more than so people, Dean Said.

 

Amtrak takes a look
at track in Central Iowa

Amtrak was scheduled to send an inspection train through Grinnell
Wednesday as part ofan effort to determine whcthcr the Iowa Interstate
Railroad track is capable of accommodating passenger trains.

It was tantalizing news to train lovers, but Amtrak ofﬁcials \verCii’t making
any promises. Nor could they, given the fact that Congress already has blown
billions on a massrve highwayrconstruction program and doesn‘t seem
inclined to provide adequate funding for Iail passenger service.

Still, the fact that a real passenger train was scheduled to make its way
through the central Iowa route from the Quad Cities all the way to Council
Bluffs was enough to conjure up images of sleek trains once again stopping
hereto pick up passengers. (That’s another matter entirely, ofeoursc; even if
Amtrak eventually decides to use the Iowa Interstate tracks, there's no

guarantee that Grinncll will even
be a whistle stop.)

It's an old argument, but it‘s
worth repeating: Amtrak's
existing Iowa routes aren‘t rczilly
serving the niainr popululion
centers ofthe Quad Cities, Iowa
City, Bus Moincs and Council

Bluffs/Omaha, There seems little doubt that a central route would mean more
ticket sales. And, if Amtrak were to decide that, yes, a brief stop in Grinncll

would be worthwhile, all to the better,

Meanwhile, it was nice to know that the train due to mil through orrnnaii
Wednesday would have actual wnttlows m in cziis M with people actually

looking tliiotigh those iviiultnvx
