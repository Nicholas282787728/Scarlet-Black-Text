“Bugs” Norris Makes Hit of» Ev-
ening by Keeping Crowd in
Constant Laughter.

By Ray Hurt.

Loyalty which was almost fanatical,
pcp which was almost hysterical and
noise which became deaiening, were
the outstanding features of the mom
ster pep meeting held in A. R. 11..
last night, one of the most br liantl
successes in the generation of spirit
ever held on the campus of Grinnell.

To the freshmen this magn lcent
demonstration of Grinnell spirit came
as a revelation, to unnerelassmen as
a great gratification and to the old‘
grads who were present as a wander~
ful inspiration. It is in no way ex—
agregatinn to say that never for that
last few years has the spirit of the
Pioneers heat so perfectly in unison
as it did last: night. From the begin—
ning to the end the whole affair went
through with a cooperation and en»
thusiasm which showing an ex—
ample for pep meetings in the future.

To begin with, the band was there
with all kinds of syncopation and
volume. Then Ahegglen was there
and acting in the role of chief pep—
stet‘ and yell leader, be sorely ac-
uuitted himself famously: Oh yes,
the team was there, too, and both
coaches also. And, say. you should
have seen the crowd!

Coach Elward began the forensic

;procticc, was released from the hospi~
