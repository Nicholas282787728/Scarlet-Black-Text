GrinneII experience—then and now

by Andrew Schultz

When George Drake came to Grin-
nell as a student back in the late 50’ ,
colleges across the country were
caught up in the rowdy vivaciousness
ol' rraternity and sorority lever. To
Drake, the exclusiveness of frater-
nities and their social cliqueishness
was ”very offensive." Grinnell was
acttrative to him as a school without
Greek letters over every portal.

Ironically, dorm life in those happy
days was only marginally removed
from ”Animal House" conceptions.
Once you were assigned to a dorm,
you lived there for four years. For
Drake, it was four years as a loyal N.
Younker dweller, With all of the initiar
tion rites and fierce parochialism ats
tendant to Grinnell’s nee-fraternity
dorm system,

in tightly knit dorms, there existed
a hierarchy of respect and social
custom which called for the freshmen
to know all of their dormmates names
by the end of the first week upon pain
of paddle. Dorm meetings often con»
cluded with the paddling oi' the or
fenders of dormitory rules or those
who tailed to keep up respect lor com-
munity standards.

Those were days of battle-tethe-
death lntra murals, spring and tall
formal dances, beanie-topped
students, and hall pins worn with
pride.

George Drake came into this
carefree environment as an Illinois
preacher's son who excelled in track
and cross country and was self-
described as an “indifferent student."

Behind the faddish social scene
there was a thriving liberal arts in
stitution which thrilled Drake and
transiormed his interests, He majored
in history, taking courses trom former
history professor and dean Joe Wall

and a new professor named Al Jones.
He went on to garner scholastic
honors, including Rhodes and
Fulbright Scholarships, and he studied
at the U. of Chicago Divinity School,
where he earned his doctorate in
church history. _
Alter iinishing graduate education,
Drake had to decide between a career
in the ministry or a career teaching
history. An offer to teach at his alma
mater spurred him toward teaching.
Then he Was off to Colorado College to

will regret taking it.”

Drake says he hopes to amplify the
purposes of the liberal arts education
at Grinnell and to ”find the resources
for a iirst class program," while
developing close ties with all members
or the college community.

He sees the role oi the college as an
institution which encourages iLs grads
to go out into the world and make
quality contributions to society. Drake
says he will miss the intimate contact
with students he could have as a pro

 

 

“I regard (Mears) not as a
headache, but as an opportunity.

“I feel Very much that I don’t know
as much as I need to know. It’s a
peculiar feeling to he in control and
yet not know all the operation
details.”

“For a good presidency, you hope it
lasts eight to ten years.”

“I hope people will bear with me, I
will try to understand the opinions of
students and i hope they will try to
understand mine."

,, Drake speaks out

“I want to be very active on cam-
pus. I want to be directly involved
with students and faculty.”

On Student Life Policy: “In general,
I'd much prefer students work these
things out. But I wouldn’t shy away
from an unpopular decision if I felt a
student decision was not in the best in-
terest of the college."

“1 Will make mistakes.”

 

teach and serve as a dean, Drake
became a member of the Grinnell
Board of Trustees as well,

when President Turner resigned
last winter, Drake was encouraged by
some fellow trustees to apply for the
position.”lt was not a situation where
I went out of my way to seek the
presidency,” he said, adding he was
content with teaching history. “It isn’t
the prestige that drew me to the job,
I'm more hardheaded and realistic. . .
there will be many moments when I

fessor and he has had to put aside a
large research project to ruliull his
presidential duties.

“I do covet the opportunity to
teach," he said and he would like to
take advantage of his position as a
history professor to team-teach a
course once he gets settled into the
presidency.

This week Drake has been getting
acquainted with small groups of
students at his home. He plans to con-
tinue these informal meetings
throughout the semester and will meet
with students in their dorms as well.
Drake will also begin a process of get-
ting to know the faculty by meeting
with five faculty members every week
until he has become personally at:—
quainted with them all.

He is candid about his purpose in,
mese getstogether, He says it is “to
show, in almost symbolic fashion, that
the president is here and out and
about."

Drake's homecoming to Grinnell has
been pleasant, but also a period of ad—
justment. It is the iirst major perma-
nent move tor his lamily and they are
still settling into smallrtown life. But
Drake also has friends from his class
living in town and iriends on the £aeul»
ty from his years as a teacher here.

“The community and college have
made us feel welcome,” Drake said.
“We're very glad to be here.”
