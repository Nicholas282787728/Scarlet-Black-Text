has not seen me dowering incense

Just think, folks, only a quarter for
the most stupendous, gigantic, in—
genious development in years. A graft
between the cypress tree and the
Mexican jumping been, grows cloves
and gives off green ink. Run up,
jump up, push the baby up, but don’t
miss this opportunity. We don't find
one very often. but when we do!

John Gleysteen recently spent a
night in Cedar Rapids, and al—
though the best of uccomodations
were offered him. he was found
the next morning stretched out
upon a mattress on the floor. Why
did he disdain the two perfectly
good unoccupied bedsvin the mom?
Our guess is that he is part In-
dian. He may have managed to con-
ceal it successfuuy until now, but
in these crucial momenm,. blood

Howard McIlreth always has some,
thing helpful to oifer. When asked
if he had any Spanish text hooks,
Mac replied, “No, but I have a lot

of Spanish tendencies."

Well, Mac, there is a place for
all things—text hooks and tandem
pies alike.

We noticed quite a crowd at one

hind to hand a strong junior team
an 18-13 trimming. The juniors got
two baskets in the first period to lead
the sophomores. 4 to 0. By thc end
of the half they had run their lead up
to nine points while the second year
men had bccu able to garner only
three counters.
In the third quarter the sophomores
held the juniors to one lone basket,
while Alexander got two baskets and
a free throw, and Straley whisked
two baskets to give them nine points
and the lead. In the last quarter
they repeated the process, and added
six more points to complete their
total of 18.

Miss Short Shots

Farrara was the high point man in
the game. sinking in two baskets and
three free Lhmws for seven points,
Alexander and Straley of the sopho-
rnores were next with five marks
apiece.

The juniors had a smooth running
team in the first half, and it looked
as if they would have no trouble in
taking a win from the sophs. In
the next half the second year men
opened up a string of long and short
passes that carried them through the
junior guard time after time. Both
teams were marked with bad luck on
their short shots.
