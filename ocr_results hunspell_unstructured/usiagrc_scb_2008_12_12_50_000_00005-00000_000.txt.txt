after the forum. “Obviously, there
is discontent that is longstanding and I've just happened to
Vlmlk on the stage at a particular time."

"When people will get to know me and 1 think, for instance
es, students that have worked closely with me know me they
realize that I make decisions that are in the best interest of
students' lives," Dougliaity said. “Sometimes that may be hard
for pcoplc to see but, in fact. that’s my motivation, I don’t have
any other motivation"

While most students have largely been skeptical of the ad
ministration, some expressed confidence in them, “I respect
[Houston and Travis] their honesty but 1 feel that the majority
ofthe students had a lack ot’conipassion," said ACE Coordina-
tor Celeste Latkin Y11. "Students blatantly accused them and
I think that these accusations weie lll—lnformed.Tlie students
had a very antagonistic view otthmgs."

indeed, while the tone or the forum was largely respectful,
it was punctuated by occasional moments of tension, In one
heated exchange, two students were quieted by the modera-
tor after interiuptiiig one another. Osgood, in responding to
a student question about how the College’s diveisity policy
might prohibit RLC and ASSistant Director of Residence Life
l<im l—lindselzrush from applying for Aiidrews’forrner position,
tersely replied,"You should read our diversity policy."

students were particularly vocal in their support for Hindse
Blush who is ineligible to apply tor Andrews' old positron
because of newly enhanced job requirements. The job post-
ing drafted by administrators requires applicants to have five
years of postemaster’s experience; HindseBrush has just foul.
Students were particularly wary gwen that Greene's position,
which supervises Andrews’, required seven years total expetie
ence but only four posremasrer's.

The waning moments of the forum were accompanied by
more pointed accusations. Victoria Brown, History, one of the
signatories to the controversial 8&3 letter-to-thc-ediror, sug-
gested that administrators were, at times, less than honest. (See
Faculty and Administrators, pg 1)

Dougharty. near the concluSion of the forum, defended
himself against the accusations presented in the previous week’s
seas letter. "Just, from my perspectivc,l would want you to
know that not everything in that letter is true and that there's a
lot that is not in that letter," he said.

Delivering the ﬁnal comment of the torum, Ralph savarese,
English, stood up and displaying what he said was Andrews'
personnel file, reiterated his grievances against the adminis-
tration, “I don't want to get into this because I actually want

Houston and Travis to thrive here," Savarese said. “But what
happened with Sheree is outrageous,"

But in the midst otrhe campus's very palpable anxiety and,
at times, acrimony some members oteanipus glimpsed a silver
lining in the recent events. Many remarked that this was the
first incident in recent memory, which had galvanized the cam-
pus. Others commented on the introspective quality ofthe dee
hates as Grinnellians struggled to define themselves and their
community

“[The forum was] successful in the sense that it was great to
have Grinnellians from all walks oflife come together to have
a discussion about what's going on in the community,” But—
rows said. “I definitely think it went well to serve as a venue for

students to share their concerns and feel like something will be
done to address those concerns," he said.

A common refrain from all those interviewed was that the
dialogues that began atThursday's forum should continue into
the future. Morake said she is planning on holding regular foe
rums in the future to continue the campus dialogie, an idea
which Dougharty endorsed.

“I think that would be great. I think whether it would be an
SGA community meeting or whatever,l think that would be a
great idea for folks to eome,"Dougharty said. “I'm always intere
esred in hearing what people are thinking and What people are
saying and so hopefully this dimension of people letting folks
know what they're thinking directly continues."
