Robert McLeod Granted
Permission to Print

Miniature Annual

Permission to publish a mina-
ture annual this spring was
granted yesterday afternoon to
Robert McLeod '37, by the facul-
ty committee on student publica-
tions. and activities.

The minature yearbook, which
will be published around May 15.
will be entitled the “Zephyr." it
will replace the old Cyclone which
was discontinued last year at the
order of the faculty committee
following the failure of plans to
secure adequate financing. The
last two annuals had encountered
serious financial difficulties
Assume Financial Responsibility

According to the ruling made
by the faculty committee, Mc-
Leod and his associates will as
sume full financial responsibility
for the “Zephyr."

The new annual, as the name
suggests, will be streamlined and
reduced in size in order to permit
a low subscription rate. Although
the editor does not plan to use
last year's Hoo's Hoo edition of
the Malteaser as a pattern, the
baby annual will be approximate-
ly the same size.

Plans for “Zephyr"

Contents of the “Zephyr" will
include individual senior pictures,
hall and cottage pictures, organ
zation cuts and writeups, togeth«
er with such features as machine-
gun photos of campus scenes, and
faculty groups posed by depart—
ments.

“This seems to be the age of
photography," Mr, McLeod said,
“and 1 plan to have the annual
chuck full of pictures. Everyone
has a camera, these days, and I
hope to have everyone contribute
pictures and thereby help publish
a representative book."

Student Affairs Committee
Approves New Yearbook Plan

Clark, Rawson
Tie for Hall Cage
Race Leadership

Rawson hall's league-leading
teams slipped into a tie for first
position in the intramural baskct-
ball race Saturday, sharing top
honors with die Clark hall cagers,
by splitting their twin-bill with
Smith's teams. The Kelly A team
lost their game to Smith’s A
squad, 18713, while the B team
downed the lowly Smiths. 17-10.

Dibble and Langan also split
their double-header. the yet under
feated Dibble B team finding the
Langan B team easy victims, win-
ning 27-3, while the Eangan A
team evened the count with a 23-
11 victory over the Dibble A team.
In the Saturday morning encoun-
ters, Clark scored a double victory
over the Gates hall cagers and put
themselves into position to share
league leadership with the erring
Kelly cagers.

Three Rawson players Were
ousted via the foul route in the A
game, forcing Kelly to finish the
game with but three men on the
floor.

Clark may not continue to di-
vide honors with Kelly for the
league lead after the intramural
hoard meets to rllle upon a protest
to the board by the Gates is team
who lost lly one ,point to Clark as
a result of a last-minute field goal
by James Stiles, who the Gates
repreesntatives assert was not
eligible to play.

Should the board rule against
Clark, their chances for a cham-
pionsh' in the final standings will
be dimmed, since the intramural
basketball competition ends next
Saturday.

Arnold — Forster Believes American Students Lag
Behind Europeans in Attitude Towards War

 

 

American college and university
students are 10 years behind those
in Europe in their attitude toward
war, w. Arnold-Forster said in an
interview this morning. The “I
won't fight” attitude here must
have somc more constructive ele-
ment before IL is of value in pro-
moting world peace.

“The negative attitude here," he
declarcd ”is caused by the fact
that our ncwspapers do not carry
information on constructive peace-
building programs in which the
United states is actually taking a
lead."

"I am very interested in meet-
ing any studcnts on the campus
who think the world may blow
up," Mr. ArnoldrForSLel' said. He
hopes to bccome acquainted with
students and faculty members in-
terested in the world peace move-
ment, and he would like especially
to meet people who enjoy drawing.

“I am a painter by trade, you
know," he declared. “I hope to give
some parties later for a group who
want to get together and draw."

Mr. Arnold-Forster was in Seat-
tle, Wash, Monday noon, and flew

 

to Grinncll in time for a 9:20 a. in.

lecture Tuesday. “If Americans
realized that in that time and dis
tance one could fly from London
to Moscow, it would help in under
standing 0[ the European situa-
tion,” he said. “You must consider
that Paris and Berlin are closer
than Los Angeles and Seattle,”

”Under those geographic condr
Itions, Great Britain cannot pos-
sibly take an isolationist policy,”
he declared, “especially consider-
ing that she rules one-fourth of
the people in the world, in every
continent.”

He is definitely opposed to the
present setup of mandatory neu-
trality, favoring instead Prcsident
Roosevelt‘s stand for discretionary
powers. “An embargo against
both parties in a conflict cannot

thc aggressor." he declared.

Complete neutrality is better
than an irrcsolute policy in arble
tration, such as has been followed
in recent world conflicts, he bc-
lieves. The solution is in offering
constructive advice and then his
sisting that it be followed.

Mr. Arnold»FdrSter outlined the

 

help but be on actual favoring of.

 

two series of lectures which he
will give on the campus. The eight
evening lectures will be a contrast
between the two courses open to
the United States in world affairs:
a policy of isolation and neutral-
ity vs. one of cautious co-opel‘ae
tion.

He will dwell particularly on
the extent to which this country
has gone in the latter field, mak-
ing as individual points a system
of conferences rules of peacee
keeping, services of peace-build
ing, peaceful settlement of dis-
putes, peaceful change, general
disarmament, and collective sccur-
ity.

His other scrics, beforc the class
in contemporary history, will be a
discussion of the course of British
foreign policy since the war, indi-
cating the necessity for a radical
change of policy which will make
effective a co-opcrativc peace
system.

British policy will be considered
chiefly as it affects that of the
United States and the rest of the
world, the British laboritc de-
clared.
