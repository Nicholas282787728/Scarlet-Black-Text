“BACK TO OLD GRINNELL”

Greetings from the Summer Resort of the Continent: Motor-
ing to and from the Atlantic coast. through fourteen states and
Canada, we found the best weather of our trip right
here at Grinnell. .And never has the marvelous fei-e
tility of our soil been more in eVidence. Cornfields
golden grain, green pastures, lush foliage, a par
disc of productivity. There ought to he plenty in‘
the land when harvest time comes. “Happy days
are here again" for the farmer, and for all the rest ,
of us.

We shall do our best to keep this perfect weath-
er at least until college opens: we should like to ‘
show our new students how beautiful our campus
and the Iowa. landscape are at their best, In any
case, there will he a hearty welcome for all our
new recruits during the Freshman Days, Sept. 20 N0LLEN_
to 23. We shall miss the old soldiers of the class of ‘37, but we
are sure that the class of '38, which promises to he the largest se-
nior class in our history, will rise to the full height of its lofty re-
sponsibility. , ‘ ,5

There will also be several new members of the faculty whom
it ivdl be our priVilcge to welcome into the family circle—new faces
in English, speech, French, political science and economics, sociol-
ogy, and zoology, to get acuainted with, while we follow with
friendly interest the old members who are away on leave. ‘

Last year was in many ways the best Grlnnell has ever known,
crowned by an exceptionally interesting commencement. It is up
to all to keep the hall rolling, to make 1937733 again the best ever.
New and old, students and faculty, we can dedicate ourselves to
that congenial task,

“Come ye back to old Grinnell,
To the college loved so well,
Can't you feel your pulses throbbing
When you come to old Grinnell?"

Contrary to the evpecta
trons of even my best friends,
ye oid Ed has secured em-
ployment. Thus it is not
without experience that we
are qualified to present
the facts about the battle of
life. Tlidviact that this is our
third week on the job does
not in the least detract lrom
the quality oi the follow
ilig presentation of facts. Our
inability to observe correct-
ly is a matter of record, so
that three years would make
little dilierencc iii the narra-
tiin which lollows.

'Tis a sad tdleisu prepare
pause between paragraphs and
Wipe the dew from your eyes.
The first morning the boss called
me in and said,‘ “I merely wants
ed to welcome you to this great
organization. Your Social Securi-
ty number is SR107-036-072. If
you are ever late to work, you
are automatically canned. If you
ever show up for work while you
are drunk, I’ll have you arrested,
but we want you to feel right at
home. Do you work better, fast»
er and more intelligently than the
other men and We'll see that you
don‘t starve,”

Gradually, you come to
know the people you are
working with. oiily yester-
day, a man said, “Good morli~
ing, Art," as 1 came into the
office. This is merely a sam-

accorded the new employees,
I've talked to some of the
other Grinneu boys employed
in the same town, and they

And now, I'm going to tell you
the truth. Working is a darn sight
easier than going to school and
don't let anyone tell you other
wise, You have dough in your
pocket and satisfaction in your
soul. Each day sees interesting
new faces, figures (both kinds),
and follies. And when five o'clock
comes around you forget all about
it until eight the next day, and,
although we did it the same way
at school, we always knew we
shouldn't have. In fact, 1 like it,
and all the giys and gals I’ve
talked to like it, but don't get the
idea that we like it so well we
won’t try to get away to sce Pres
