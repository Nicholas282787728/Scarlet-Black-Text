In a former article we promised
to give latera few of the local reaS»
ons why students of Grinnell should
train this season. First among
these is that we want to develop as
many well rounded, symmetrically
built'mcn as possible, and track
athletics ought to play no mean
part in that work‘ol all-around de-
vclopment. 2d. Because ourhome
ﬁeld day will mean more this year
than ever before. The winning of
a second or third place will be no
small athletic honor and judging
from the interest manitcst and the

. number expecting to cmttpvtc, none

of those honors will be cheaply
won. The importance oi home
ﬁeld day comes largely from the
work that will follow. Closelyaft
or our home contest will come the
Dual League meet with S. U. 1., to
be held at Iowa City. Three men
tor each event_\vill be taken to that
contest. The opportunity at tloing
something for (itinnell College in
that contest ought to be sufﬁcient
incentive to make every one of our
college men, who have thv least bit
ol track ability, get down to thor-
ough work.
match to try the relative strength
of the only two schools of the state
that have held a high place
in track athletics. First place will
be good enough for our team in
that meet.

After this comes the State Con-
test to beheld in Grinnell. It we
are ever going to get our ﬁngers on
the state cup again we must do it
this year, and with the contest on
our own track we ought to be able
to do it. This will be the greatest
athletic event at the whole year
and it will be a sorry day for some

there will be sent in and expenses
paid. There is no reason why we
should not ﬁgure very prominently
in this contest. Four tired men
got us fourth place among the col—
legcs ol the wast last year. A full
team ought to do much better. 3rd.
in preparing for these events wt-
will have the help of one. of the
best track coaches of the country
who will give personal instruction
in theoretical and practical train-
ing.

These ought to be motivcs strong
enough to make us work in such a
way as to turn out a winning team.
