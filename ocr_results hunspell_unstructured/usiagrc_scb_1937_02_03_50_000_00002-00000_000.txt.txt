of Grinnell Teams
in Loop Play

The Oklahoma Aggies, current
basketball leaders in the Missouri
Valley flag chase, have been
“cousins" for the Grinnell cagei-s
during the 16 games that the two
teams have engaged in,since the
organization of the present Mis-
souri Valley circurt in 1927, am
cor-ding to statistics compiled by
John c, Truesdale, Grinnell cage
mentor.

During the 10 years that theK
Aggies and the Pioneers have
been waging their hardwood wars
fare, Grinnell has come out on
top in 11 encounters, with the‘
Oklahoma team capturing the re-
maining five. This does not in
clude games played during the
current season.

Ranking next behind the Ag-
gies in me list of “cousin" teams‘
comes the Washburn Ichabods
against whom the Pioneers have.
chalked up three victories andl
one defeat, prior to the opening
of the current season. Also, two
of the four games have been over
time affairs, with the honors
even, although the Ichabods re-i
quired two overtime periods to
annex their sole victory; over the
Pioneers.

On the other side of the ledger,
in dark red ink, is the Creighton-
Gn‘nnell record since 1927, which
stands, Grinnell no wins; Creigh-‘
ton 16, It is also this series
which shows the greatest differ
ence in total points, with the
Bluejays compiling a total of 596
points for the period, in contrast
to the Pioneers 406, Creighton

of 37 and 1/4 points per game,
while Grinnell has notched the
hoop for an average of 25 and
it, points.

Not So Successful

Against Drake, Washington and
Tulsa, the Pioneers have not been
so successful, and the record
book shows more losses than
wins. Grinnell has won nine and
lost 10 games in the series with
the Drake Bulldogs. The Pius
neers have done worse against
the Washington Bears winning
but 7 out of 18 encounters, while
Tulsa, one of the junior members
of the circuit in length of men-iv
bership, has downed the Pioneers
on five occasions, while failing to
stop the Grinnellians in two con»
tests.

A survey of the records against
loop foes shows that Grinuell has
engaged in nine overtime cons
tests, three of them being two-
