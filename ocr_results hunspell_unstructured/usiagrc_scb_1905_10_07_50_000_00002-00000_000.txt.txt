our: SELF-SACRIFICING PROV
FESSORS—A DEFENSE.

In a recent issue or the Sc. new
A BLACK an aiticle was published
presenting what was sairl to be the
student view or the spirit in the
present Iowa College i'aciilty. The
article aroused many comments and
in defense or what is beliercd to be
Llle general opinion or the strident
body, this article is presented.

At present we have a irlculty oi
which every student and supporter of
1owa College may well be proud and
which is the equal oi ally college in
the West. In no other place uill a
group oi men and women he iound
who are more ready and willing to
sacriﬁce and labor ior the good or their
school than the faculty or lowa
College.

Itisaconﬁrmed iact that present
members or this body have reinsed
during the past year, to accept posir
tions which odered an increase in
salary, varying from three hundred to
three thousand dollars. Loyalty oi
this order toa school should receive
'tlie highest praise and admiration of
us all. In regard to those members
who have left us this year, we wish to
say that only one has bettered himself
ﬁnancially, but even in his case the
ﬁnancial question had nothing to do
with his resignation.

The old Grlnllell Spirit, as we who
lrnow it best, is at present more preva-
lent in our present iaculty than ever
before, although we have undergone a
change, and have lost several valuable
men yet we believe that their posi-
tions are competently lillcrl. We would
have no one third: that our professors
are mercenary in spirit {or it is a well
known fact that the present college
professor is iar underpaid in compari.
son to men of the same abilities iii the
business World.

Through this organ oi the strident
party we wish to acknowledge our
deepest gratitude and appreciation to
these men and women who are sacri-
ﬁciug ior the good ol old 1. C., and
may the spirit and conﬁdence which
exists at present between the faculty
and the student body, long remain
intact. A Sexicr.
