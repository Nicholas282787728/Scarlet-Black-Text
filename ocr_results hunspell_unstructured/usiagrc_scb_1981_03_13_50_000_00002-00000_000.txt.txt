IIIOIIIBI' Illllllll'll

Last week a new AFL-ClO union, District 925 (read 9-t0-5), sprang
to life. This new union carries the banner for the organization of
America’s 20 million office workers, most of whom are women. The
union is being run for women and by women in a move to aid workers
through those who understand them best.

Although women comprise the greatest share of all office
employees in America today they hold no bargaining power. Their
wages reﬂect this — the average female wage is 59 cents for every
male-earned dollar. Amazingly enough in these days of “equality”
this average is lower than the 1955 ratio of 63.9 cents to one

Granted the mere mention of unionization usually meets with
hostility and some people even blame organized labor for our sagg-
ing economy, the problem goes deeper still. It seems inconsistent to
argue against better wages benefits and working conditions for of-
fice employees whose top wage is often less than $15 000 per year and
at the same time justify paying someone with a somewhat more
prestigious position $40,000 per year.

Do office workers actually deserve less pay because they do less
work or do they just perform different, less glamorous duties?
Many, many clerical workers are heads of single-parent households

. working to support their families as well as finding time to fulfill

their roles as mothers. At the office their tasks are boring and
repetitive. But they are expected to do quality work because slop-
piness at the typewriter is just as bad for business as sloppy handl-
ing of clients.

Education is usually held as the reason some jobs pay better than
others but today that argument' lS fallacious since more and more of»
fice workers have a college diploma Obviously some other reason
lurks 1n the background

However, regardless of the reasons why, the time to equalize is
now Giving clerks better wages could actually stimulate our
economy by giving 20 million people more buying power. No matter
what form of improvement the union makes companies will still be
better off because happy workers are productive workers, workers
who spend more time at their desks than on coffee breaks.
