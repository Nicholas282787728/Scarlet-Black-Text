Hoping to extend its winning
streak, the women’s lield hockey
team will host the University of
Nebraskaon Friday and Iowa
Wesleyan on Saturday for another
busy weekend. Game times are
4:30 pm. on Friday and tpm. on
Saturday on MacEachron Field.

In a thriller last weekend the
Pioneers surprised Graceland 1-0
on Saturday, alter losing to a
talented Luther squad 31 on
Friday. In other action, Luther and
Graceland played to a 2-2 tie on
Saturday morning,

Coach Cindy Winkler felt her
team provided a “good com»
petitive game against a
powerhouse in hockey," and
played a strong lirst hall against
Luther. Outplayed in the second
half, Grinnell was unable to score.

On defense, lreshman Lisa
Bowers played a strong game, but
the offense was unable to coor-
dinate its attack in its first taste of
action against a team with
a lull complement of players

A goal on a penalty corner shot in
the last five minutes by ell-captain
Jill Kriesky put the Pioneers in
lront or Graceland, a team Grin.
nell has not defeated in several
years.

Both teams played an even lirst
ball. but fatigue caught up with
Graceland and it did not present
any scoring threats in the second
half.

Center halfback Kim Krutilla
was cited by Winkler for an out-
standing otlensive and detensive
game, enabling the forwards to
attack more strongly. Grinnell had
six penalty corner shots in the
second hall to dominate the ol-
lensive play, while Graceland had
none.

needed self-assurance. The win
convinced the Coaches that this
year's team will play a caliber at
football at least as good as last
year’s 4~5 squad

large lead

The tempo of the game was very
slow in the first quarter, Both
teams' defense prevented the
opponents irnm making a scoring
threat, It wasn't until 9:10
remained in the second period that
Paul Crane lofted a lortyyard
pass to cocaptain Paul Delaney
tor the game’s first score. Dave
Wopat made a successlul con-
version which gave Grinnell a lo
lead,

Things began to jell lor the
Pioneers after this score. The
defense continued to stop its top
ponents and alter a Grinnell march
down the field, Mark Bowman
powered his way through the ups
ponent's delensive line for Grin-
hell‘s second touchdown With
Wopat’s second successlul con-
version, Grinnell ended the half
with a commanding 14-0 lead.

The team entered the second half
with the same momentum that it

. had in the second period. Grinnell

quickly stopped Iowa Wesleyan's
ollense and Crane‘s crew once
again marched downlield, With
7‘28 left in the third period,
Bowman's second touchdown run
and another Wopat kick gave
Grinnell an almost unbeatable lead
of 21-0. it wasn’t until 12:32
remained in the game that Iowa
Wesleyan scored.

'Solid delense

The top highlight of the game
was Grinnell’s defensive control of
Iowa Wesleyan’s strong running
attack. In tact, except tor a couple
oi plays. the delense consistently
shut off Iowa Wesleyan’s entire
offense. Coach Hunt was also
pleased with the showing of the
defensive reserves. He said “there
wasn't a big dropofl from the first
unit to the second unit.” In the
past, Grinnell hasn’t been blessed
with two defensive units of such
talent,

Today, Grinnell travels to Beloit
lor its Saturday game in Strong
stadium. Bowers knows that
Beloit's team will be superior to
the team that Grinnell beat 31-14
last year. However, the coach
believes that Beloit is not much
better than Iowa Wesleyan,

Just when it looked like the
women’s tennis team was retur'
ning to the top-notch form of last
season. the girls stumbled a bit as
Coe College beat them, 7-6, last
Saturday at Cedar Rapids. A tew
days earlier, the team surprised
Simpson College. 6-3, in another
road meet.

Tomorrow, Grinnell participates
in the Central Invitational. Coach
Anna Wack said theteam hashad a
history ol not playing well in in»
vitationals. One exception is
sophomore Maggie MacFadden,
who won the Drake Invitational in
her bracket last year. In recent
meets, she has replaced Karen
Meyer in the top singles position.

The first home contest of the
year is Tuesday at 4-00 pm.
against Cornell College. The
visitors have a new coach and

better than last year.

The Grinnell team started the
campaign with a loss to William
Penn and evened its record with

Take two

the upset of Simpson The Simpson
team had beaten William Penn
prior to the Grinnell contest. so, on
paper, it looked like the Pioneers
had little chance. But Wack
shuttled the lineup and added two
players, and Grinnell won. The
victors were Meyer, Robin Recant
and the two additions, Nancy
Fernandez and Marion Miethke. In
doubles, the Pioneers won two oi
three.

The Coe match was a disap-
pointment. Wack cited the loss oi
MacFadden in the top spot as the
match that could have changed the
outcome. MacFadden battled back
from a 7'1 deiicxt to lie at 7-7, but
lost the final three games. “My
concentration broke," she said.

The team has lost the two
matches that Wack expected to win
and has won the contest that the
coach expected to lose. Said Wack.
“All I can say about this bunch is
that they surprise me." She added
that she does not expect the team
to lose anymore contests.

More safety possible

by Toni Arenberg

At a point late in Saturday's
soccer game against Carleton.
Grinnell’s Pele St. Thomas took a
bad fall. He landed on his back and
had the wind knocked out of him.
Coach John Pfitsch treated him
and a short time later, St. Thomas
was walking it off on the sidelines,
In all, it was a mild accident,

But with a small stretch of the
imagination, the scary part of
the incident becomes un»
comlortably apparent. What if the
injury had been serious? There
was no doctor assigned to treat
soccer injuries. In fact, with the
exception of football, there was no
doctor assigned to any of the sports
Saturday.

Granted, iootball is where most
serious injuries are likely to occur.
But to think that they occur so
infrequently in other sports that
the presence or a doctor is not
warranted, is risky. The dangers of
soccer, lield hockey and basket.
ball, to name the best examples,
are greater than lirst glance might
show.

The idea of one doctor per sport
is ridiculous. It's too expensive and
would require practically every
doctor in town A feasible. wor»
thwhile plan would he to hire one
doctor from one o'clock until [our
o'clock every Saturday aitemoon
to serve each of the events oc-
curing around campus at that
time. The extra fee would be worth
it. A minor hitch is that all events
scheduled for Saturday—and that
is most of them—would have to
happen between one o‘clock and

four o'clock.

Medical attention during week-
day practice sessions is probably
as good as possible. The team
coaches are capable ol treating
some hurts and junior pre.
medicine student Rick Grayson is
in the vicinity of the training room
every afternoon during practices.
But. ideally, each sport. or at least
soccer, ileld hockey and basket-
ball, should have its own trainer
who is knowledgeable in the
treatment at injuries. Intramural
football should probably have a
trainer as well.

To guarantee a greater number
of qualiﬁed trainers in the future,
the college should prepare now.
Even students with no present
knowledge of athletic injuries
should be recruited to begin study
under M0 Hunt. the college's head
trainer The college should also be
Willing to offer credit andor a
wage greater than the usual $2.07
per hour when these students reach
the proficiency and responsibilit
level that Grayson has now. It will
probably take that much to attract
these students. But it is better than
annually trying to tind nearly-
qualllied trainers.

While on the subject ol safety, it
is a good idea to move back the
benches on both sides of Rosen-
bloom Field three yards. As they
are. a tootball player could easily
run into them at full Speed, which
is an easy way to get hurt, or
course. Also, the soccer iieldneeds
a lot ol improvement. It is
dangerously hard and rutted.

The sternest test of the Grinnell
soccer team comes tomorrow as
the hooters travel to play Knox at
Galesburg, Ill. Judged to be the
best team in the Southern Division,
Knox has twice in a row fallen to
Lake Forest in the Conference title
game. The Slwash lost only three
players from last season so
Grinnell coach John Pl‘itsch’s
squad hopes to improve from last
week’s 20 loss to Carleton. \ -

Before approximately 2o.
Grinnell partisans, the visitors
from Minnesota played stingy
delense, preventing the Pion
offense from mounting a 5mm
attack. As for the two Carleton
tallies, Pfitsch commented, “When
we got under pressure we became
very rushed.” Perhaps “scram-
bled eggs” is a better term. for all
three goals scored against Grinnell
this season have resulted from
defensive players becoming
