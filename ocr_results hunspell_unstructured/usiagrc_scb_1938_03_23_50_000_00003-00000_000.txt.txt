Duke to Experiment in Track Procedure

 

New Meihods
Will Be Tried
In Twoﬂeeis

Relay Events Will
Replace Individual
Track Races

By Wells Barrett

Two new methods of procedure
in track competition will be ex-
perimented with by Pioneer run-
ners this spring during two meets
on their outdoor schedule, ac-
cording to Coach G, Lester Duke.

The first innovation will be
tried on April is when the
Pioneers will meet coe in their
only appearance this year on the
home track. The meet will be run
as a novice competition.

No individual track events will
be scheduled, according to Duke.
Instead, the two teams will run
a full program of relay events,
including the 44D-yard relay. half-
mile relay, mile relay, spiint med-
ley, two~mile relay, a mile team
race. and a shuttle hurdle race.
One point will be given the team
winning each event.

A full schedule of field events
will be on the program, but they
willl be scored on a team basis.
The teams in each event will con-
sist of two or three men, Their
records in the event will be added
together, and the team with the
best total record for the event
will score one point.

According to Duke. this pro-
cedure, which is‘heing used for
the first time in an American
intercollegiate meet, is more fair
because it cuts the emphasis on
one outstanding indi idual. In ad-
dition, it provides competition for
more runners.

The second experiment will be
tried on May 14, when the Pionr
eers will meet Iowa State and
Drake on the same afternoon.
However. the meet will not be a
triangular affair, but instead
three dual meets being run con-
currently, each team meeting the
two other teams at once in dual
competition, It will not be scored
as a triangular meet.

The outdoor schedule:

April 16: Coe at Grinnell.

April 23: Iowa state Teachers
college relays.

April 29-30: Drake relays.

May 6: Beloit relays.

May 14: Dual meets with Iowa
State and Drake.

May 20-2 : Conference meet at
St, Louis,

It is‘also possible that a few
Pioneer runners may enter the
Central Intercollegiate meet and
the National Intercollegiate in
June, according to Duke.

at Des Moines Saturday, and
were only able to garner 11 1—3

Pioneers Hope for
Comeback; Stress
Baton Passing

ny olurk Smith !

The Grinnell thinrclnds arel
preparing for their last indoor
meet of the current season, Frir
day, when they will journey to
Iowa city to meet Iowa univer-
sity, Iowa state, and Drake in)
the sixth annual state indoor
quadrangular track meet.

The Pioneer squad is hoping to
stage a comeback after last Sat-
urday's poor showing in the Mis-
souri Valley meet. Favorable!
weather has made it possible for]
the squad to hold its practices
outdoors the last few nights.

Emphasis in recent practices
has been on baton passing as
there are two relay events listed
in the meet this year, The four
men to run on the half mile team
will be chosen between Keating.
Luther, stryker, Appleouist, Ha—
gen and Cranny.

For the mile relay. Coach G.
Lester Duke will probably run
Luther, Hagan, Cranny and
Schlotterbeck in that order. Also
of interest in the meet this year
is the one mile team race. Peder
sen, Mortimer. Seeger and Beck
are entered in this event.

Ted Appeiquist pulled a leg
muscle and will be the only men
not in top shape, Weight-man
William Sampson has fully Ie<
covered from a back injury that
kept him out of competition for
several weeks.

Following the meet Friday
night, Coach Duke has ordered
his charges to take a complete
rest before returning from spring
vacation. At that time, the squad
will have two weeks to prepare
for their first outdoor meet here
against Coe. April 16.
