Last SGmGStGI‘ithc Thursday of Hell Week; students, faculty, administra—
tors and staff piled into JRC 101 for a community forum on the state of the campus. People
crowded the stairs and spilled out into the hallway. Everyone came seeking answers on topics
ranging from hirings and firings in Student Affairs to the Office’s policy on calling home

when a student has been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.
The theatrics that ensued would quickly turn into legend.
Amidst student skepticism,Dean of Students Travis Greene
assured

students that he had no "double top-secret agenda." In the
forum's waning moments, Ralph Savarese, English, rose
from his chair brandishing what he claimed was Sheree
Andrews’ personnel file and excoriatcd administrators for
impropriety. ,

Much ofthe anxiety on display at December's open forum
was rooted in fears about ongoing changes in the Office
of Student Affairs. With substantial turnover in the top
ranks of Student Affairs, its new chief administrators have
implemented a number of changes—starting this summer
with a complete divisional reshufﬂing—that have been
referred to as “professionalization.” For proponents, the idea
encourages creating policy based on “best practices" from
other institutions, ensuring adherence to federal mandates
and opening lines of communication. To detractors,
professionalization insinuates the demise of Grinnell’s
uniqueness and incorporation into the mainstream.

CHANGING TIMES

The changes since Dougharty's and Greene’s arrival
have been substantialr Shortly after Dougharty came to
campus, Jennifer Krohn, former Dean of Student Life,
was transferred to Institutional Research, beginning a
divisionrwide restructuring of student Affairs. Employees
within the division, such as Director of Service and Social
Commitment Doug cutchins, took on new duties and at
times moved into new offlces.While most students may not
have noticed these organizational changes, students paid
attention when Associate Dean and Director of Residence
Life Sheree Andrews was abruptly placed on administrative
leave on Sept 8.

Additionally, the office has explored some controversial
policy moves, including proposed modiﬁcations to the
role of Student Advisors and a reluctance to fund a trip to
protest the School of the Americas.The apprehension was

exasperated by the Constant churning ofthe College rumor
mill and a growing sense that students were not consulted
in these policy shifts.

Some ofthe proposed changes were framed in the context
of aligning the school with policies at other institutions.
This was specifically true, for instance, in the case of the
policy ofcalling home for students hospitalized because of
alcohol. At the December open forum, Dougharty spoke
of the need to adopt such a policy by comparing Grinnell
to other institutions and prevailing trends in the field; he
said that Grinnell had no such policy and that he had never
been at an institution without one. At other points in the
year, there was also some discussion of involving Student
Advisors in assessing yearrend fines for dorm room damage
and the Office also created a sorteof internship position
for students interested in careers in Student Affairs. Both
of these proposals were seen as moves to align the student
sraff positions closer to the resident advisor systems that
predominate at other schools. Dougharty’s arrival was
also accompanied by apparently more stringency in the
enforcement of alcohol policy; the school’s historical
laxness in this area had been something ofa hallmark that
encapsulated Grinnell's offbeat nnd looser approach.

in hiring for open positions this year, student Affairs
has gencrally made a point ofieaching beyond the crrnnell
communitywithrhephrase“casringnswidenncrnspossible“
quickly an Office favoriteiob postings for both the Dean of
students and Associate Dean positions required more post-
master's experience than similar positions in previous years
and ntothcr institutions.This year's crop ofRLc candidates
have exuded a noticeably more businessrhke demeanor—
pinstripe jackets and pantsuits and generally more sober—
as compared to some of rhe more eccentric characters rhat
have graced Grinncll’s residence halls in recent years.

Some have cited Dougharty as a “change agent,"
specifically brought in to shake up the organizational
culture that predominated on JRC third ﬂoor.

"I think the rate ofchange has been a big part of the
schism and controversies," said SGA Treasurer Emily Wax
'09, who helped organize last semester's open forum. “Andi
think that has harmed our community."

“BEST PRACTICES”

What really underlies many of the administrative
reforms, and student anxieties about them, is something
far less tangible and yet potentially more significant than
any individual policy change—a desire to bring increased
“professionalization” to the office—a general desire
Dougharty has expressed, Administrators‘often describe
such changes as moves which will beneﬁt students by
discarding failed practices and incorporating new dynamic
ones from outside institutions. In the case of staff changes,
Dougharty has described the process as marching staff
members' skills and passions with their duties, while raising
expectations for staff “were expected to be significantly
more involved than we used to be," said Kim Hinds-Brush,
Assistant Director of Residence Life and Loosehcad RLC.
A simple example she poinred ro was formally requiring
RLCs to know the names of their clusters' residents.

Much of the organizational restructuring is cited as an
effort by Greene and Dougharty ro increase communication
between all Student Affairs departments'like the
Career Development Office, the Health Center and the
Chaplains Office—as well as increase communication
with the student body. “What became clear to me [soon
after arrival] is that those collection of departments and
programs have not necessarily worked very intentionally
as a student affairs organization," Dougharty said, which
he felt prevented Student Affairs from providing “the
best educational experience we can for Grinnell college
students." Dougharty's holisric view of Student Affairs
informs his push to increase communication between the
different departments.

In deciding when and how to reform Student Affairs
practices, Greene said that the division often looks to
other schoolsiboth small liberal arts colleges and larger
institutions—to get a sense of the “best practices of what’s
out there . . . [and what] keeps us in line with the legal
and policy mandates." conforming to national "best
practices” allows the College to evaluate its policies against
thc broader scope of higher education. Communicating
