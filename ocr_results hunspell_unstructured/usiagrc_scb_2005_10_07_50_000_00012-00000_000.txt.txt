Women’s soccer: No scoring on these girls LAW“—

Bv KEVIN BVRNE

Pioneer women's soccer team is currently outscoring its Midwest
Conference opponents 42-1. Needless to say, the scoring binge has
produced a stellar record and excellent momentum into the final
stretch ofrlic season

The Pioneers have amassed a record of7 2 1 with an unblcmr
ished o o mnrh' in conference. Theii outstanding performance can
be attributed to their unselfish performances on both offense and
defense.

“Overall our team success can not be attributed to one specific
aspect of play," said Gabi MaldonadOrBell'OQ “Our team has done
a greatjob of maintaining our level and style of play as opposed to
adopting that of the other teams."

The women played a pair of games over the wcckcnd against
two conference opponents, Lawrence and St. Norbert'l‘hc Pionccrs
were in good form, shutting out hoth schools, zeo and see respoo
tively.

In Appleron, against Lawrence, Grinncll walked into the locltcr
rooms at halftime after it scoreless 45 minutes of play.Thc Pioneers
turned up the offense during the second half, scoring two goals
Within three minutes nfeach othcl.

Katherine Ni 09 scored oilr a corner kick by Rebecca Mack-
cnzic "09 in the 60th minute to put Grinncll up 1 0 Senior Kari
Moskowiu scored unassisted from 35 yards outjust tlilee minutes
later to give Grinnell another point nnd its final margin ofvrctoiy.

Gtinncll outshot Lawrence 3171, with 18 shots on goal.

The very next day, the squad headed up to Dc Pctc,Wisc. to take
on St. Norbert. Kate Dicdrick '07 scored first for Grinnell with an
unassisted goal early in the contest. Rachel lVIoskowitz’OlS followed
with a goal at the 17erninute mark on an assist from Dicdrick to put
Grinnell up 270. MaldonadOchll added a goal at the 3lrininutc
mark on an assist from Moskowin to give the Pioneers a 370 land
heading into halftime.

The three goals were all the Pioneers needed and then some.
The Pioneer defense played just as wcll as the offense. posting their
fifth consecutive shutout injusts as many conference games.

“I think part of the success of our season thus far ‘is because of
consistency."s:lid Moskowitz. “We have worked hard to be mentally
and physically pteputcd to play a full 90 minutes oftonm offense nnd
defense every march."

Grinnell will iemain on the road this weekend as they head to
illinois to take on the defending conference champion Lake Forest.
Grinncll will be looking for a 7-0 conference record and perhaps
their sixth straight shutout ofthc season.

“Our focus for the next three days will be on those aspects ofrhc
game that we know will help us succeed against Lake Forest," said
Head coach Henrher Bennmg. “Additionally, we will spcnd time
mentally prtpnring to rncc the defending conference Champion.
we're going to be sharp, hopefully win and then have n [\Voﬂvt‘ck
bleak from league play." .

all at the and ofthc first day ofthe championship.

The second day ofthc competition did not go well
