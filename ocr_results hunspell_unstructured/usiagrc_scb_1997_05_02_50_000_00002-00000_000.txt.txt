plays are performed in the Flanagan‘
Arena Theater. These plays are the
result of a project for Theater 376 1
Directing. There are ten plays which
offer a wide array of theatrical tal-
cuts and themes.

Mark Huang ‘97 is directing a
play called Retreat Sytndmttie which
is based on a short story by Pltilip K.
Dick and adapted to the stage by
Huang himself. This play takes place
in a science-fiction type of setting
and is about a woman who remem-
bers killing her wife three years ago,
however, her wife is still alive, The
main focus of this play is , what is
reality7The lead in this play is Mary
Beth Dechant ‘00 wltile her wife is

ofthe cast and crew are Sarah Piltch
‘97. Ryan Gibson ‘98, Laura Tanz
‘99, Brendon Healy ‘00, Kathleen
Ducey '00, Brian Smith ‘99, Eric
Hanson '00, Leah Milcarek ‘99, and
Teresa Schutz ‘00, The original story
was about a man and his wife, Huang
made a major casting dectsion by
placing a female in the lead role, In
fact, the original story has 6 men and
1 woman, while Huang‘s has 4
women and 2 men. As Huang says,
“This adds a whole new dimension
to the story,"

This is Huang‘s first time direct-
ing text , and he says "This has been
a good experience, an interesting ex»
perience, but I don’t claim that eve
ery moment of it was good, I know
now for sure that I don’t want to di
rect. not that I really wanted to be
fore." Huang's play was pertoinied

About this venture at directing,
Rogoway says, “Directing is exe

crew have been incredible to work
with. This project would not be pos-
sible without the assistance ofKeIley
Wagers, our stage manager. Intere
estingly, she has neverbeeli involved
in the theater before."

Matt Wagnci ~97 directed his play
“Fun,” written by Howard Kortler. on
Wednesday night at 7 and 9. The
crew members for this play were

The cast for the play consisted of
Jesse Whipple ‘00, Neil Stone ‘99,
Allison Groves ‘00, Chris Kaiscrlain
‘99, Nick Hartshorn ‘99, and Jason
Stohler ‘00. According to Wagner,
“Fun traces the ill-fated adventures
of two restless, frustrated ﬁfteen year
01:15 as they embark on a one night
quest to find fun in the modern
world."

Carolyn MacCullough ‘97 is die
rooting “Long Ago and Far Away"
by David Ives at 7:30 this Saturday
and at 2 this Sunday. The cast con-
sists of Hannah Lobel ‘98, Todd
Shanbachet‘, Joe Lauber ‘99, and
Sara Shives ‘97. MacCullough says
her play is “about a woman who is
searching for her own identity and
attempting to come to grips with her
life when unexpectedly she finds
herself in an alternate reality and in
the process finds herselfas well. It’s
rather surreal, somewhat comic and
somewhat sad.”

Christina Barrigan is directing a
play also by David Ives, “The Philae
deiphia" at 2 this Saturday afternoon
and at 7:30 this Sunday night.
Barrigan says, “This is a comedy
about the metaphysical condition
which causes bad days: the Phila-
delphia. Mark has what he thinks is
a bad day until A] explains to him
that it is, in fact, a Philadelphia. Afr
tcr learning about his condition,
Mark learns how to get along with
it. Then we learn that even if you
can get the hang of it, it still can go
very wrong. It is a short, funny play.
To tell you too much would destroy
the humor."

Joseph Moon ‘97 is directing
“Death Knocks”, a play by Woody
Allen this Saturday at 7:30 and this
Sunday at 2.

Moon says his play “is a comedy
about a very incompetent Death that
has come for a 57 year old man, Nat
Ackerman. Gregg Whitworth ‘00
will. be playing Death, and Padraig
Johnston ‘00 will be acting as Nat.
To sum up the play, Nat must defeat
Death in gin rummy in order to live
another day. How they go about play-
ing cards and the discussions they
have is where all the humor lies."
Moon says of this experience, “I have
very much enjoyed directing these
two fine actors. and even though the
Fine Arts building is being renovated
and it lot of the tools that are nor-
mally accessible to the'Directing
Class aren’t, I still feel that the pro-
duction will be wonderful."

Additionally, Mark Rosenkoetter
‘97 directed his play “Path of the
Son." by Kevtn Rich, twice on
Wednesday night. Ryan Brummel
‘97 directed his play “The Actor’s
Nightmare” by Christopher Durang
last night and will do so again at7z30
tonight. Finally, Michele Host‘s play
“The Sandbox" by Edward Albee
will be performed at 2 on Saturday
and at 7:30 on Sunday evening.

At the Movies...

with Nick Terpolili
and Win Rosenfeld

Shine

There have been a few movies in
the past year that really shouldn't
take any heat from Nick and Win. So
we are gonna try. It's a movie about
a young boy who wants to learn how
to play the piano. A semi-progedy,
he is brought up by his father who
gives him the lessons that pique his
interest. However, daddy pushesjust
a little too hard. Verbally and physi»
cally abusive, his father cannot ex-
press the love that he feels iii an ap
propriate and supportive manner.
Eventually, the young boy disowns
his family and leaves for the music
conservatory where under the exe
treme pressures of his life he tackles
his biggest challange, the third cone
eerto of Rakmaninoff. A funny,
touching and true story, Shine is
about the amazing life of an amaze
ing man.

Secrets and Lies

Psst...I have a crush on Marsha
Brady. Ilove soyburgersihave seen
the secret passage beneath the log
gia. I have seen the quad workers
sacriﬁcing young suckling pigs. I left
my Masaratti at home. i am Dustin
Key’s love child. I own the S&B. I
like eating kiwis naked.

Now which are secrets and which
are lies?

It’s a good ﬂick. No lie.

Big Night

Here’s another film which prob-
ably shouldn’t take any hits from
your ﬁne ﬁlm critics. especially con-
sidering the fact that involves Ital~
ians. If the fact that there are Itale
inns in this film isn’t persuasive
enough to get your lazy non-hairy
bodies up off your beds and off to
Harris, then I don’t know what we
can do. There’s certainly nothing
that Win and Nick can do, but we can
tell you that in Big Night, two Italian
brothers decide to open an restaurant
serving AUTHENTIC Italian food
(we need these people in Gtinnell,)
soon thereafter to be SLruCk with the
blow ofa trendy Americanized Ital-
ian restaurant (Jesus Christ, how
many beLrayals will there be?) tak
ing all of their business away. The
brothers plan an event to increase
business which technically falls
through, but the good part is that
EVERYONE LOVES THE FOOD,
To make a long story short, the broth
ers ﬁgure out that there’s pretty much
nothing they can do on this bitch of
an earth, which they are content with,
because....well, you’ll just have to
see the film, now won’t you? At the
very least, you’ll probably never
want to eat at Sbarro again.
