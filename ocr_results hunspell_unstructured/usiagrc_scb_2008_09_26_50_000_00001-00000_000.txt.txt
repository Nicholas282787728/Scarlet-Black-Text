EcoHouse hosts local foods cookout

BYARIANISFELD
Last Friday, EcoHouse hosted a local foods
potinclt, which featured fruits, vegetables and
a goat, all grown and raised within 100 miles
of the town of Grinnell. According to Chris-
tine Grummon ’11, an event organizer and
Ecol—louse resident, the potluck was hosted to
“show people that local foods are delicious.”
The dinner did not consist of pork
and corn, though, According to organizer and
Ecol-louse resident Jacob Gjesdahl '10, the
dinner featuled fruits and vegetables from the
Gtiiinell FarmersMaritet, student-run gardens,
and Grinnell Hcritagc Farms, which provides
a basket of assorted produce at a monthly fee.
Event organizers picked apples from Ahrens
Park in Grinnell.
oatmeal, barley and corn meal came
from Paul's Grains,a local farm in Laurel, Iowa
that boasts “chemicalsfrcc since 1964," on its
websiteThc grains were used to make biscuits,

which attendees are with great speed.

The plats dn jour were goatehased: kebab,
stew and a roast. The goat was one of many that
grazed at CERA this summer as part of an ex-
pcrimcnr and MAR “In theory, I am very okay
with it,” said Brian Perbix '09, who worked with
the goat as a researcher. “If any goat] is going
to be eaten, pmirie-raised, local-fed, student-
raiscd animals [are preferred]."

The culinary experiment had its roots in
academia, as it was part ofa MAP titled “Think
Global, Ear Local.”With few exceptions, Eco~
House resident Hart Ford-Hodges '10 and two
otherstudentswill only eat food produccdwirhe
in 100 miles ofGi'inncll for the next month.

The house will not be completely bound by
the 100 mile rule. Fold-Hodges said they would
continue to consume roodsrutrs like spices, cof-
fee and tea, which are not readily available from
Iowa farms, “It's not meant to work perfectly
You have to make . compromises," she said,

“The intent is (0 be conscious otwhat we are
eating."

The term “local" is somewhat ambiguous,
Ford-Hodges acknowledged that not all local
food is “good food," but said that being aware
ofwhere the food comes from provides more
control because she know the farmers. “I know
...They are taking really good care of the soil7
maintaining the local environment,"she said

Organizers said they were surprised by
the enthusiastic turnout and the number of
local food dishes guests provided. “I am rce
ally impressed with the amount of food people
brought," Gtilmmon said.

Henry Reich '09, who said he is a local food
advocate. was pleased by the meal, though he
missed a number of dishes because he came
lare. “The lamb stew was actually really good,"
he said, adding that he also enjoyed the both the
apple crisp and rhe casserole

Carroll, Palmer
prep for coming
House race

BV PATRICK CALDWELL

While most voters will not need to think
about entering a polling booth for over a month.
Grinncll students will have an opportunity to
cast their ballots early on Wednesday, Oct 1 in
the South Forum Lounge.

As students mark oer their votes, many peo-
ple will be presented with the familiar options
of Danny Carroll and Eric Palmer. Both are
once again running for 75th district in the Iowa
House of Representatives for the third time in
six years.

Palmer ms elected to the scar two years ago
as the Democrats retook control ofthc House,
assuming the spot that Carroll had held from
199472006.

Both of the previous two elections have
been decided by close margins, with Palmer
winning by just 691 votes in 2005 and Carroll
holding his seat with only a 314 vote advantage
iii 2004.

With the narrow margins the past two elec—
trons, many people have observed that college
voters have often made the difference in out-
comes. “le understanding is [lmr it was the
College that made the difference,” said Valerie
stimac '09, coeleader of the Campus Republie
cans.

Both candidates for the State House offer
clear ditterences on a number of issues. speak-
ing with the 58:13 earlier this week, Palmer
cited education, healthcare and creating alter-
native energy sources as the primary issues his
campaign has focused on. Carroll could not
be reached before the SBcB went to press, but
leaders of the Campus Republicans cited lower
taxes and family issues as the primary focus for
Carroll’s campaign.
