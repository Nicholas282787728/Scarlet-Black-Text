problem according to Giddins is that
techniques such as bending notes to put
them outside the western scale and
playing unnotatable rhythms often are not
taught soon enough in academic en-

academically trained musicians to play
important solos because most great jazz

Weekend Enlerlalnment:

Farewell. MY
Lovely

Directed by Dick Richards
Starring Robert Mitchum
Fri , 9:30 p m.. ARH: Sun , 9:30 pm, $1..

First-rate film fare awaits Grinnell
moviegoers this weekend when Fareweﬂ
My Lovely plays. The 1975 iilm, based on
the classic detective novel by Raymond
Chandler. is a finely crafted film noir with
all the requisite characters: a hard-boiled
Los Angeles detective with a cynical
outlook and a sense of integrity that makes
him odd man out in the Vitiated world he
inhabits; a sultry fcnlnle fatalc from the
wrong side of the tracks who seduces her
way to stardom and climbs over the
corpses of her discarded lovers on her way
to the top. a suave gangster in a white
tuxedo who runs a high class gambling
casino patronized by the local Socialites
and a dimswltled ex-con whose search for
his old flame -— the brassy chorus girl
Velma Valentoisets the labyrinthine plot
of thievery, blackmail and murder in
motion.

Mitchum who better captures the world
weariness of Chandler’s hero, 3 man who
has been around long enough to know all
about corruption. With his gravelrvoiced
melancholy, his deadpan wit just made for
oneliners (c.f. “she had enough sex ap
pcal to stampede a businessmen’s lunch"
and his expressive face once likened to “an
old Catcher's mitt,") Mitchum wrests the
role from his more famous predecessor
and gives it the irrevocable stamp of his
own personality.

But perhaps the most dazzling star in the
iilm is the city oi Los Angeles, a tawdry
paradise in the 19405, captured by the
camera oi cinematographer John Alonzo.

Indeed, the Los Angeles setting with its
sordid allure underscores the film's
central theme: the American Dream.

both corrupt and deceitful. The only way
to get rich quick is to cheat: as Marlowe

Raging hull, the true story of a former
middleweight champion Jake La Motta, is
a searing iilm showing the rapid decline or

boxing; it’s the story oi a man who’s more
of’an animal on a path to self destruction
driven by a terribly violent gift he can‘t
control.

absorbing, credible portrayal for which he

been reduced to fit in a marketing for-

Jackson. Some of these musicians have
been iorced to market their product
through New Wave channels.

Giddins is optimistic, though, because he
believes that true artists will express their
indlvidual passxon even if their market is
limited, Moreover. Giddins remembered
being “outraged because Sonny Rollins

There is nothing sentimental or
