. wouldn't be the place to come " He
rephrased the term separatism as
"distinctiveness" and said, "One
should not expect one to throw away
line's cultural baggage when one ar»
rives in Grinnell." However. he added.
“I don‘t buy this idea that the black
community is a homogenous group."
Pierce felt that diversity is the most im-
portant characteristic of the black coma
munity, “We don‘t need more numbers
but real diversity in black students."
He continued. "As far as i am concern-
ed. there could be 10 to 12 black
students as long as they are diverse."

Another question which was posed to '

various students concerned the Black
Cultural Center On 1003 10th Avenue
According to Williams, the Black
Cultural Center opened as a museum
years ago with hours from 9 pm to 5
pm. Since that time, the center has
been used ior many other purposes
Presently. Williams said. “It ls housing
for two students who also act as
caretakers. it is a meeting center in the
evening and it is a museum and cultural
center open to all individuals."

Only members may enter the center
alter 5 p.m. When asked whether these
hours created separatism. Williams
said. "The reason for the rule is so that
black students have a place to be
together in the evening." Yet, she leels
that “it is silly to have such a rule. The
center serves a good purpose, yet the
hours prevent other people from attenr
ding CBS meetings." Nelson agreed
that "there is no reason why the
business-like hours of the center could
not be extended into the evening."

Yet, Johnson emphasized that the
center “is a place for black students to
go tor support, Some black students
need this and the home-like atmosphere
of the center does not foster
separatism.“ He also said. "White
students do not utilize the Center
much.“

This year Pierce is the caretaker of
the center He called the center “a
meeting place for our events and
organizations that concern black
students; [where we can] express

ourselves politically and socially
Black students are “trying to make i
more functional." he said and cited as
examples of this movement the poetry
, readings which were held at the center
and open to the entire campus. Pierce

said that whites and blacks have at-

tended such events and added. “there
no clandestine policy against whites
When asked if there was a policy
regulating the hours that whites could
be in the house. Pierce responded dils
ferently than other students involved
with the center and sai '1 am truly
unaware of it. I it e sts.

Barry Huff. associate dean of Student
Affairs. concluded discussion of this
topic by saying, ‘the tact that the
center is closed to non-members after 5
pm. could be perceived by some
students as meaning that no white
students are allowe .

A final topic, raised by Pierce. was
the educational policy at Grinnell
Although Pierce is concerned about the
relations between black and white
studens. his main concern is the educa-
tional policy at Grinnel "We need to
integrate the black experience into the
American experience such as in the
English and history. ierce stated He
is not satisfied with current course (ifs
ierings and called the AfrorAmerican
inter ciplinary concentration "a
mockery. But it should be pursued Just
II E any other major." He attributed
this absence of black expe ence in
Grinnell‘s curriculum to ' lack of
creativit in develo ing integrated
courses" The Rosentield Committee
has been helpiul in incorporating
blacks into its program by bringing to
campus such speakers as Dennis
Brutus. Julian Bond and Andrew
Young. However. Pierce tell that the
biggest need is "to reeducate the [aculr
ty and that's the hardest thing to do ”

also concerned about black and white
relations, when asked about

"the number at blacks coming next

When asked how the office is attemp-
