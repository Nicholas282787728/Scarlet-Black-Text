DORIC

When Scribo Gosllorn, acting
editor this issue, sent out a des-
perate plea from Iowa's “City of
Parks" for contribution to Doric,
he slipped up on something. Not
being on the campus, it seems
that now would have been an
ideal time for an “Off the Cam-
piis” splurge. However, we have
heard a little of “this and that"
which should be of interst.
e . r

ucrtiy winner otto Gusmison
may have taken it easy in college,
but aparently he’s been wasting no
time since graduation. ,At least.
his name was thc first we have
seen of the class of '33 among the
marriage license applicants.

Most and (at least we think so)
of all the news appearing in this
issue, is the story announcing
that the College shop Will not
open this fall. When we heard
about it, our first thought was
”Where will we go during chap-

e1?" No doubt you are wonder.
ing the same thing. iLook’s as if
maybe there will be a big Cams
paign to get the White house
open during that period.
s s s

And with the Shop closed,tlicrc
will be so many things we will
miss. No longer will those five

or as Oxley “heats it out" by us-
ing a table top as a drum; no
longer will we drink ten cokes
per day in the smoke filled
rooms; nor will we able to 1‘67
cline on the porch and shout in-
sulting comments at couples men
andering across the street,
as s .

We have just been informed of
the sad misfortune that overtook
“Triple-Gear” ‘I’hiebeault this
summer, It seems that the Clark
terror and another fellow were
taking a sailboat trip far out in
Lake Michigan when the boat up»
set. The two fellows were in the
water clinging to the heat for
26 hours heforc they were res-
cued. Imagine Thieheault with
only one person to talk to for 26

 

old booths reverberate until clam»

 

hours Worse yet, imagine being
that one person.
. s r

Idle rumor has it HIM several

couples that were so inseparable,

last year will not continue on the
“steady" basis this fall. We also
hear that a certain popular and
very attractive cocd who lived on
second Meai-s last year, will re-
turn to Crinnell with the “home
ties" to which she remained loyal
last year, completely broken.
Here's a chance for some of you
guys.
i s r

rerhops Doric should close with
a few suggestions to the neo-
phjtes to whom -this issue is dedn
icated. With that in mind. stis-
ors recommend that a blanket
warning be issued to all future
league board timber to beware of
Cogswell's “main and checkln‘,"
of Tommy Stout’s Owatanna strut
on the hardwoods, of Freddie Lue
ther's prowess on the football
field. These men are the kind
that sweep a girl off her feet be
fore she‘s been adequately
warned.
