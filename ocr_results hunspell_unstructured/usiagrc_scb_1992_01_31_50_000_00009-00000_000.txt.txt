OK. In case y'all’ve been wonderr
mg \vhatkind olcampus band action
IS taking place this semester, the fol-
lowing article is a bunch of inter
views With as many campus bands
tharcarod to contactme. It may be cut
out and used as a handy “reference
card" to decide if you really want to
hear some gig at a futurcpoint in your
Grinnell Experience. Of course, you
really shouldn’tjudge aband by what
kind of interview they give" aftcrall,
Grinnell gave you the benefit of the
doubt during yours...But, if you’re
interested in what these guys have to
say, talk to them. Don’t read this. It’s
dumb.

acquired a name during the interview
(tell me that isn’t top-notch joumalr
ism). Its members are: DustyJermier,
Sarah Dye, Michael May, Kerry Marr,
and Louis Madsen.

Louis: (takes a sip from his club
soda Spritzer) You know I really en-
joy the notion ofjazz.

DS: Me too. Is that how you would
descibe yourselves? A jazz band?

Kerry: Oh. I think it goes beyond
jazz. We are very diverse - jazz defi-
nitely being a big inﬂuence on our
sound. We also have country, folk,
and blues inﬂuences.

Michael: (runs his fingers through
his ample brown mane) We have a
very original sound, I think. We have
a lot ofsoloingand lots ofblendingof
styles.

Metal can be just as cool as whatever

overall persona of the band?

Even though Poppa Mezz is not
really a functioning band on campus
(even when they ARE playing), they
still deservesomeroom in print,damn
it. I talked to George Paine about
them and he says they have a show
with Corduroy atStateStreetcoming
up. The band includes (George just
gave me the ﬁrst namm - they’re real
informal): Aaron, Alan, George,
Chris, Neil, and Half-brother to Axl
Rose Todd Threet. George descibed
the m as bei n g
"Couno-ybluespsychcdclicfunhock."

Brian Tester. John Siqveland, and
George Paine),

style?

All: Music. All three of us have
written songswit’s kinda mixed up.

tious crowd.

John: You bet. 1 Spell colorwith a

08: Do any ofyou own Doc Mar-
tens?
