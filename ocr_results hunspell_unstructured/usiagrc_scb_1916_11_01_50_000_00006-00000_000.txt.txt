ALL too long young men

have had to wear clothes
made for their elders. Clothes
minus the youthful lines, the
do and dare, that youth de-
mands.

He argued that the word of :t Folk
ucian should be as good ,as his bond.
That party platforms were made to
stand on and not merely to set in on.
He then cited how tile Democrats had
not only fulfilled their mvii promises,
but also those of the Progressive pair
ty. He Said. that the Democrats had
passed the most constructive policies
in twenty-rive years. A few at these
he named as the Federal Reserve act,
the Child Labor law, the \V'orkmztli's
Compensation act, and the provision
for railroads in Alaska.

Mr. Daniels showed a tendency to
put the burden of proof on the repub-
licans. lie said that they were erill-
cising “Wilson [or his foreign polio/Y4
He asked, \l'liat would they have
done?" He claimed that Mr. Hughes
had nowhere committed himselr in any
of his speeches and that Mr. Roosevelt,
whom he characterized as thc modern
Unislopogaas, always smelling blood,
had not been any more definite. El
Daniels dwelt on Roosevelt with much
Sarcasm and evident enjoyment.

As regards the European War. the
speaker did not have much to say,
though what he did shy was lzluriatory
of Wilson. He discussed at length tho
reasons why the United States should
not have protested against the viola»
tion of Belgium's neutrality, hut neg»
leeted what would. have been of more
interest to his audience, a discussion
0: the Lusitania. incident and the her
gotiations arising therefrom. Coming
on to ilcxico he gave a historical
sketch of events there as Ear as the
Huerta administration, but gave no
discussion of the Villa. episode, the
musterlng of troops on the harder and
the question of the embargo on aims.

He devoted considerable time to a
discu n at tuccoimtry's prosperity,
denying that it was Caused by war
orders.

In conclusion he said that the elec-
tioll DI :\Ir. “'ilson meant peace and
the election of Mr. Hughes meant jeo-
pal‘ zilig peace; that the election of
“'ilsoll meant the continuation of pros»

before." In speaking or his love for
children, he said, “I would not ghc
ten cents to appear on the front page
of ”rho Register and Leader,‘ hut i
have given, I know not how many
brihesior the smiles or liable. "

In ﬁle few minutes that he spoke,
his hearers were given a rare insight
or the personality of a great man, and
certainly all agreed with his characr
teiistic remark, “It might he u-nrsc.”
