Activists
get down

For the third consecutive year, activists
from all over the Midwest join Grinnell s’tu-
dents and alumni for a weekend-long envi-
ronmental conference sponsored by FTP

or REBECCA TAYLOR

Young acrivisrs from across rlic
Midwest will gather in Grinnell
this weekend for the third annual
Hoedown in the Heartland Confer—
cucc, sponsored by Free the Planet
(FTP). Organized in memory of
Greg Schrieber, a dynamic Grinnell
student activist who lost his life in a
swimming accident rhrce years ago,
the conference is an opportunity for
students to come and learn about en,
vironinental and
social justice issues
and attend (mine
ing sessions, orga~
nizets said.

This year, Hate
down will focus on
issue briefings on
organizing move-
ments fighting
Ford and Cocae
Cola, in addition
to environmental issues, organizers
said. Some of the students who at-
tend arejust starting groups, and the
networking that occurs at Hoedown
allows them to connect and mingle
with seasoned rraincrs as thcy gain
experience.

The trainers include members
of Monaco org, Apollo Alliance and
Rainforest Action Network, said Jes-
sica Pctertil ‘06, one of the organizers
of the conference. “Not only will the
student activists learn more about the
causes for which they arc campaign-
ing, they may also improve various
skills through attending trainings,"
she said. “One really exciting addition
rhis year is an anti-oppression rrnin-
ing, which will give srudcnrs an ime
portant lens for their work."

Program, FTP is bringing Kevin Dar
naher to campus. Danahai is the co—
founder of Global Exchange and will
deliver a keynote address called, “Core
porate Accountability and the Alter
native Economy" at 8 pm. on Satur
day in the Forum North Lounge.

FTP has arranged rhc conrci-cncc
so that activists can learn more about
different techniques that have been
effective in enacring change, said Pe-
tcrtil, She recalled mooring students
at past conferences
who explained how
they had gotten
their University of
Minnesota campus
increase wind
power usage. She
also recalled an
incident at a party
during the first
Hoedown where
she was offered a
summer job. She said her story is not
uncommon: often students benefit
from learning about volunteer oppor-
tunities and internships ar Hoedown.

The number of alumni leading
issue brieﬁngs and training sessions
is formidable and serves as evidence
that students’activism does not dwine
dle after college. “It is evident from
alumni experiences that careers can
be made out of one's passions," Pe-
rcril said. “I think it's a very inspiring
weekend," FTP hopes that students
who attend will return to their re—
spective campuses infused with ener-
gy and drive to “challenge the powers
that be."

FTP is responsible for the ramp
tion the conference has received so
far, and they have attempted to make
sure rhar their group has members in
