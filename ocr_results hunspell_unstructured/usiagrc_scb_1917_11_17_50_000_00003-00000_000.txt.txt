The program given by the Zoellhel'

last evening included both nltr inod-

The quartette by Beethoven was tol-
lowed by two numbers or the ultra—

lish composer. This is the {list tune

compositions et Geesseiis. The works
‘of this writer are characterized by
their tree harmony.

Instead oi the Larghelto by Na—
pravnih the Zocllllcrs pla'eii an Inv

than death dance by the same i
was played as an encore. This hind
01 music is especiall adaptable to
the tour-instruinciit arrangement.

The ”American Quartcttc." by
Dvorak. was composed while the
writer was visiting near Cedar Rap-
.ids. it will be remembered that the
local string quartette pl d
nnniper last spring. The invc
tion of Plolcssul‘ Pici'ccs eigan
tion was more colored than that
heard last evening

The tntue piogi-am was played en-
seinhle. The “Adagio ma non troppo"
mmement of the Beethoven number
was a real test at the art of ensem-
hie playing. The sustained p ages

Khaki and gray are to he the (zi-
vored colors this winter, Ail the rain-
bow shades will be under a cloud.
and drab will be much in evidence.

\\'omcu's organ‘ atlons in colleges
have showed their willingness to boy-
cott bright yarn for knitting. The
self government league, the Y. W. C.
A. cabinet. \V. A. A. board. and the
Intelrsnoicly committee. acting for the
societies, have all signiﬁed their ap-
proval oi the action to give up gaily
colored qu'ns.

"lie movement was started by the
Pan Hellenic Council of sororities of
the Univer ty of Iowa, and has been
taken up in Grinncll. "This action."

ys the Daily Iowan, “will be an er—
tcctive check upon the u=e or any-
colors
among the girls. Surely colored yarn
is lalliug into bad repute So low is
its standing that some uniiersity gii ~
are saying that the ﬁnger of scorn is
going to be pointed at the woman
who continues to click ltcr needles
thin the brilliant yarns.”

This action is not intended to di

the need of knitting with gray and
liliiilii yarn. II the hopes of the girls'
organizations are realized. drab will
