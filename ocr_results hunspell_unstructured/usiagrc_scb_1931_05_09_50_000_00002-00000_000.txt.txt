WHY LIVE IN CLASS GROUPS'.l

Tho strict segregation of classes in the quad ,
Tangle is a problem of perennial consideration, That
the system which prevails in the dormitories would
not he successful is obvious both because of the
purpose of roommates ill the quadrangle and lace
cause of the tenacity of the tradition.

Ono objection to m' ‘lng of classes is that after
the older members of a group graduate the younger
members are left frielldless. This might possibly be
true if one of the collections was composed of all
seniors with one under classman. In any ordinary
group however, the bounds are so elastic that such
a situation would not: arise.

Another objection is to the effect that women
should go unaided through the approved yearly
stages ot‘ lawlessness and studiousuess. It would he
a similar theory, though more disastrous if a class
in Latin were given a text book and denied all in-
structor, or if a laboratory section had directions
but no assistance.

The acclimation period of the freshman year
and tho different rules for freshman women dc-
mand a segregation of this class. Sophomores, junr
iors. and SOIJOI‘S should all be meeting the some
problems and could proﬁt by a greater variety of
neighbors. Such a principle would, of course, b3
ordinarily humane in the matter of choice of room-
mates and intimates, and some groups might con—
ceivably be made up of women with the some
scholastic classiﬁcation.

The plea for less segregation is not a plea for
rigidity in any direction. It is merely a step toward
greater freedom, which, after all, is the crowed
object of the quadrangle administration.

IN PRACTICE
(From the Yale News)
The undergraduate is becoming more and more
emancipated. Restrictions and limitations in force two

degree are not as conﬁning as heretofore. In the future
one of personal selection, and the success which he

own initiative. By increasing the burden, it is expected
he will meet his added responsibilities. The new cur-
riculum announces that the time for this greater re-
sponsibility and freedom is at hand. If the student fails
to take advantage of the education offered and neglects
his Work, an axe, self-administered, will without cere-
rnony cut short his college career.

But along with this intellectual emancipation, a
highly desirable factor in a progressive institution, is
placed side by side the incongruous system of com-
pulsory class attendance. it is the ever-present life-buoy
thrown out by the suicide, who generally does not. avail
himself of it.

In the cut system we have an institution not com-
patible with our other educational advances. It is a
debatable question whether a student Should be forced
to ELLE—Dd a. class from which he rocsives no knowledge
or- inspiration. In this rnany an instructor concurs. So,
like Harvard, Yale should liberalize her rules in favor
of complete freedom or failing this, greater exemptions.
A student with an eighty or eighty-ﬁve per cent average
in a course has manifested his interest and knowledge
in that course. surely he should he allowed to make the
decision for himself whether a. particular class in which
he has excelled is as beneﬁcial to him as one in which

he has a low rating.

MAKING THE LARGE COLLEGE SMALL
(From tho Syracuse Daily Orange)

Whither hound? That is the question which the
modern educators are now puzzling about when they
regard the American university with its enrollment.

However, they are decided on one ground; that the
educational institution with tens of thousands of stur
dents is too large and too inclusive an entity to well
handle the different problems brought forward by tops
of thousands of individuals of varying types and win
varying ideals and pursuits. Of course, it is-nn idealistic
viewpoint which they present, for they desire to create
a university which will treat the undergraduates fls-ln:
dividuals and not as a single object among other similar
objects.

Idealistic or not, however, there ha ,
of late to move in this direction, Harvard, at the present
time, is formulating plans which will enable it to break
the university up into smaller units, in all probabiiity
modeled after the English college system. Whether is

' . iccessful remains to be seen. ‘ .
W1“ glider”, the question which is of the most interest
to the student on the Hill is, “Is such a trend prescntl
at Syracuse?" We think that there is. The neutral oi-
ganization is now considering the housing together of
the neutral men whose interests coincide. This is a step
in the direction of the plans of the Harvard adm tra-
