Success Story Is
A. Brown’s Career

Anne Brown, perhaps better

Porgy and Bess, a role She originated, will open the 194445!

known as Bess of the opera,

concert series in Herrick chapel on November 18.

The daughter of a Baltimore
physician, Miss Brown learned
to sing at an early age and made
her first debut at the age of four
when she sang for the soldiers
at camp Mead, just before de-
mobilization. As time went on
she sang the leading roles in her
school operettas and as soloist
in church. In the spring of
1934 then she graduated from
Lhe lulliard School of Music in
New York, Miss Brnyim wrote
George Gershwin asking for an
audition, having heard that he
was at work on the opera,
“Porgy". Not only did Anne
Brown win the feminine lead in
Gershwin's opera, but he re—
named the composition in her
honor; Porgy and Bess.

Song With NBC Symphony

“From Bess to Beethoven“ wast

one reviewers comment, when
Anne Brown appeared as soloist
with the N. B. 0. Symphony un-
der Leopold stokowski when
she was still starring in "Porgy
and Bess.”

lt marked the return to her
original ambition. Prominent
musicians urgcd her to give up
her Broadway role and resume
her more important concert ac-
tivities. And Anne made her
choice in favor of a concert ca-
reer. She is now singing
throughout the country on her
third coaststcccoast tour.

She has appeared as soloist
with the New York Philharmon-
ic Symphony, with the Philadel.
phia Orchestra, the Los Angc~
lcs Philharmonic, the Chicago
Symphony, and in concerts
throughout the principal cities,

Appeared In Picture

Last spring Miss Brown was
featured in “Rhapsody in Blue,"
the film based on the life of the
late George Gershwin. She plays
ed herself in the movie portrayal
of Gershwin‘s life.

Before appearing on Broadway,
Miss Brown studied at Morgan
College in Baltimore, at Teach-
er's college, Columbia university,
at the Joilliard School of Music
where she rcccivcd the coveted
Margaret McGill scholarship for
post graduate work — the only
Ncgrc singer thus honored.

Besides being a singingactrcss,
Anne Brown paints, designs hcr
own clothes, and enjoys interior
decorating. Her most prized
possession is a. port of the orig
inal score of “Porgy and Bess"
writtcu in the composer's own
handwriting — the love duet and
“What You Want with Bess ?"

Boredom in

Prison Camp

“Send uS difficult books. We
have time enough to Spend a
day on a page.” So wrote a
prisoner of war in Germany
to the Geneva office of the
World Student Service Fund,
the student relief agency

. whose work is supported by

Amelican students and fac-
ulty.

This plea for help is being an.
swered as books go into the pri-
son camps by the thousands each
week. Shortly after Americans
first began to be taken prisoner
they began asking for books so
that they could combat the ter-
rific boredom of life in prison
camp. The aid of specialists
was secured in compiling lists or
basic textbooks in several fields
and Lhese books were obtained
by the WSSF through donations

. by publishers, by purchase, and

by collection of used books from
college campuses. Around 50.-
000 books were collected between
Jan. 1 and Sept. 10, 1944, and
are now in prison camps in Ger-
many or on their way.

A. former Grinnellian, Milo
Rundcll, ex '43, has already ex-
pressed appreciation for books
received through the wssr.
other former Grinnell boys now
in German camps are Lieuti Dou—
ald Jacobs, '42, and Lieut. 0k-
ley Wheeler, ex '42. Lieut. Jack
Jaquis, ex '45, is interned in a
neutral country, and Lieut. John
Kelsey, '36, is in a Philippine
military prison camp. The Jap-
anese government has permitted
aid to prisoners of war in Jap-
anese-held territory, and the
WSSF has contributed books for
shipment on both sailings of the
diplomatic exchange ship Grips-
holm. .

WSSF Gives Food

American studenm may com-
plain about college food, but at
least there is enough of it to
supply the requisite energy for
study, athletics, jitterbugging,
and all the rest. it is hard for
us to realize that other students
may be facing actual starvation.
Many of them are cndeavoring to
keep up their studies even un-
der these conditions. The WSSF‘
committee in Europe reports that
many young men and women,
studying secretly with antirNazi
professors rather than enroll in
Nazified universities, do so at
the expense of the food tickets
uiey would be given if they
”collaborated." These under.
ground students arc so inade-
quately fed that many of them
can rcad only an hour a day
because of tlic condition of their
eyes due to a vitamin—less diet.

Shipments of food purchased
with WSSF funds havc been sent
to starving studcnts in Greece.
In Switzerland and Sweden,
where students have suffered
comparatively little from the
war, students arc “adopting" in.
dividual students in Belgium and
Holland and have raised funds
to send food to those countries,
