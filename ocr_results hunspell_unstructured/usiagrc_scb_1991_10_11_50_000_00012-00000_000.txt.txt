Men’s soccer team knocks off Knox,
moves to ﬁrst place in conference race

By Steve Johnston

Grinnell men‘s soccer team suf-
fered their second conference loss to
the Coe Kohawks, 2-1. Grinnell
outplayed the Kohawks throughout
the whole game but still had trouble
scoring.

The match remained scoreless until
Coe scored 30 minutes into the first
half on a direct kick. The first half
ended with the Kohawks on top 170.

The Pioneers started off poorly in
the second half. They took the field
ready to stick it to the Kohawks but
couldn’t gettheball into the goal. Coe
didn’t share Grinnell’s problems.

A Coe striker scored when 3 Pic»
neer missed his mark on a throw-in.
This brought the score to Coe 2 and
Grinnell 0‘

Midway through the second half
junior Jeff Stadler smashed the ball
into the Coe goal giving Grinnell its
ﬁrst, and last, goal.

The game ended in a disappoint-

ing loss for Grinnell 2-1,

Last Saturday Grinnell played the
Knox Siwash and came up on tlte
good side winning 2-01 After coming
off their heartbreaking loss to Coe,
GrinnellwasreadytobcatKnoxagain.
In their last meeting Grinnell hamr
mered the Siwash. unmercifully hu-
miliating them 5-0.

This game was not as high scor-
ing,but still came out well forGrinnell.

Play duringtheﬁrst half was fairly
fast and furious for both teams, but
neither was able to score until mid-
way through the first halfr With 15
minutes left in the half, junior Doug
Hodum passed 30 yards downfield to
fresh Zack Dietz who then dribbled
by a devastated Siwash defender and
passed off to sophomore Mike
Stenberg, who smashed the ball in for
Grinnell’s ﬁrst goal. The ﬁrst half
ended with Grinnell up 1-0.

At halftime, Grinnell senior Mike
Washbum reminded his fellow play-
ers that “Our dwtlny is in our own

hands," and with this bit of wisdom
the team was given the will and en
thusiasm to win.

Tenminutesintothe the half.Mtke
Stenberg scored again on a comer
kick by senior co-captain Erich
Giebelhaus. Frosh Nate Erennaman
brilliantly blocked a ball over the
goal on a direct kick with 15 minutes
left in the match.

TheSiwashdidn’thavemanymorc
opportunities to score during the re»
malnder of the second half and the
match ended, 2-0 Grinnell.

After Comell’s 2*] loss against
illinois College last week, Grinnell’s
win against Knox puts them on top of
the conference by a half game. With
only three games left in conference
play, a loss for Cornell this week
against Coe would ensure Grinnell’s
position as conference Champs.

Grinnell plays Illinois College on
Saturday.

of their players within twenty-five

team showed “patience and persis-
tence.“ The persistence paid off when
