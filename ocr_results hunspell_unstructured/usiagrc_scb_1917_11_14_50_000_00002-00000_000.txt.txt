ways been the ideal and aim oi Grills

Those who attended the meeting or
the heads oi all the organizations in
school that was called by Dean Foch
tor the purpose oi launching the y. it,
and Y. iv. campaign to ohtain war
liunds realize the value that a Rotary
‘Clull would ‘be to this institution.

Such a club, ii the writer rightly
understands the purpose, would acs
complish two his results, First, it
would combine all interests heliind
any movement which conceincd ‘tlle
‘enﬁl‘e school. Second, it would eliilli-
nate all iriction hctween various [has
tions which is now present .or which
might arise.

It is proposed that this club should
be a supplemental to the student
