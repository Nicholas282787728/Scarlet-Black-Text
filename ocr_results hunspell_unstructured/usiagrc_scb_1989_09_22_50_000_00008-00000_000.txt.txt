By Jennifer Kyvig

The women's tennis team opened
its season this past weekend with
away matches against Beloit and
Lake Forest. Playing two consisr
tently strong teatns in a span of 24
hours,thePioneersfinishedrespecta-
bly with one win and one loss.

The match against Beloit on Sat»
urday was close. Four narrow de~
feats, however, put Grinnell on the
short end of an 8-1 final score. A
bright spot. though, was freshman
Amy Fort’s 6-0, 6-3 victory in
number-four singles.

The women made quite a come

Grinnellis Finest Gear U p for Water Polo

By Caryn Plait

Most people do not realize that
there are two sets of mles to water
polo: the rules for what the referees
can see and the rules for what they
cannot. In other words. there are
above-water as well as below-water
rules. That may sound like rather
poor sportsmanship, but ask any
water polo player and while he will
agree with four»year vetetan Kevin
Docrschug that there is “a lot of
kicking, a lot of elbowing, a lot of
kneeing and a lot of blood," he will
also agree that it adds to the excite-
ment of the game. First year player
Joe Zimsen concurred with Doer-
schug, saying, ”I thrive on the vio-
lence. I think I'll enjoy the pain."

Women’s Rugby — a New Tradition

By J u re Kaster

“Rugby is a social sport," said
J ulieSlivinsky. coach and captain of
the women’s rugby team. Since
mgby is played during both the fall
and the spring, the team has plenty of
time to follow their philosophy of
“having fun, meeting people, and
drinking beer.”

The sport has gained international
recognition only recently but here at
Grinnell,the women’srugby team is
in is fourth season and has become
the biggest club sport on campus.

Currently,thereare30pan.ieipantsy

affording everyone plenty of play
ing time since 15 players compete
on the ﬁeld. The team is quickly
becoming a tradition as player and
fan interesthascontinued to grow on
campus. This strong show of com-
mitment to rugby has allowed the
team to obtain necessary funds from
SrGtA. in order to compete in tour-
naments. Hosting a tournament is a
goal of the team but more S.G.A.
funds are needed.

 

 

 

 

At the beginning of each season
drills are run and the experienced
players teach various aspects of the
game. Once players have grasped
the general concepts, intra—squad
scrimmages are used to prepare the
team and educate the competitors.
Traditionally. the host team has a
party after every game where the
players get to know each other. The
season consists of four or live gam“
(scheduling occurs during the sea-
son) and two tournaments.

“Bar practice” is also becoming a
tradition for the women mggers, who
head to the Bar once or twice a
season in the spiritof their philosopy
“to just have a good time.“ Team
leaders include coach and captain
JulieSlivinsky,‘scrums(orforwards)
captain Mary Beth Diencr, match
secretary Paige Schuman and treasr
urer Lara Puglielli,

“Rugby gives women a chance to

' be aggresive, butmostly people play

because it’s a lot of fun," said Sliv~
insky.
”The excitement of the fans is

this Saturday at 1:30 pm. and the
team expects the same exciting and
obnoxious fan support which has
made the Grinnell women’s nigby
team a cornerstone of Grinnell club
spons.

From the looks of things this sea
son should be very exciting, both for
the players and the spectators As
many of the team's veterans are off-
campus this semester, the team is a
very young and inexperienced squad.
There are approximately ten fresh-
men participants and a few upper-

classmen who are playing for the'

first time in addition to only about
five returning players, As young and
inexperienced as the team is, Doer-
schug notes thatthe“freshmen look
as good as I’ve ever seen the frosh
look before. We'll be competitive."

Another factor that makes Grinr
nell an interesting opponent is the
fact that the water polo team is actu-
ally a student-run club. unlike many
other teams in the area. Itis billed by
the men's swim team as “a way to
keep in shape without the boredom
of year-round lap swimming." Be
cause of this, it is sometimes not
taken very seriously.

Perhaps to acertain extentone cart
understand why.CurrenLly,the team
is practicing only twice a week. on
Tuesdaysand Thursdays,from51o6
p.m,, which does not give them very
much time. They spend about half

and the rest scrimmaging.

No, Grinnell — Not Cornell

By Ann Treisunan

"It was weird. I was there, but I
couldn't play."
—— Kathy Zabcl, injured captain

Okay, okay, so the weird quotes
are gettingalittlercpetitive.Well.so
is the Grinnell women‘s soccer rec-
ord. The women are 30 now, after
stomping Cornell, 5-0.

The Cornell team probably wished
that they had stayed home last
Wednesday. Grinnell took a few
moments to get into the game, but
once they did,Comellwas ﬁghtinga
losing battle.

Sara (can you say hat trick?)
Conner did it again. Of course, her
first goal involved a question of
ethics. Mana “the Spam" Fraboni

tapped the ball past the keeper and
before anyone knew what was hap-
pening. the super quick Conner was
finishing the play. Once again
“Sparta" was robbed of her glory.

“I did it for the team!” Conner
claimed. Later, rumors that Conner
had been playing for a pizza if she
scored three goals were confirmed.
She refused to comment on the
matter.

Anya Schwartz scored me other
two goals. One was assisted byJenny
Wood and the other was a simple
case of Schwartz, the ball, the goalie
and the net. Needless to say, no one
ever called Comell’s goalie Spider-
woman.

fense. Said fullback Nancy Kaiser,

tentand comfortable with thcskills,"
Doerschug said, “we’ll go to almost
all scrimmaging.”

Doerschug‘s position as contact
person may be compared to that of a
captain, and he basically leads the
practiccs“with as little leadership as
possible,” he says. so that he may
remain an integral part of the team.
He also calls other schools to are
range matches for the team.

A second factor that makes Grin;
nell an interesting school to compete
against is that one member of the
team is femalc. John Williams, a
senior who has played all four years,
does not think it matters that Sheila
Tom is on the team, and says, “We
think nothing of her playing on the
team as a female.”

Docrschu g was quick to add, ‘The
only difference is her suit is a little
bitbigger than Lherestoftheteam’s.”
He did, however, commcnt that
“other teams are not sure what to do
— until she gets in and shows them
she is for real."

Tom has noticed however that
other teams’ members arerarely “inv
different" Still. she is not looking
for attention just because she is a
female on a predominantly male
team. She says she is “used to play
ing on men’s teams, but there is
always going to be some tension.“

Her ambition for the season is not
scoring goals, Tom says, but rather
to come out of each game “feeling
like they can treat me like any other
player,” “I want them torespect me,”

she said. _
When asked why, aside from

wanting to keep in shape for swim»
ming, people come out for the team.
Doerschug was forced to admit that
it was not for the fame, glory or
money, butjust for the fun of it.

“It is all very lax,” he said. The
team is “just out there to have fun.
That’s all there is to it.“

“We shut ’em down."

Coach Eskildsen was happy with
the win, but said he felt that the
women must cometogetherasateam
evenwhile cmshing opponents “It’s
imponant for us to continue to grow
asa group. Improvementas a team is
our top priority," Eskildsen said.

The women are looking ahead toa
pairof tough matches at Lake Forest
and Beloit this weekend,
