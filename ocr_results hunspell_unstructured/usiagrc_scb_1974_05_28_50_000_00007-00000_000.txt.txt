Ex-Edilor Views Grinnell

by John Wylie

Working in news for three years could
make a cynic out of any normal Grinnell
student. it has certainly done its best
to make a cynic out of me.

If l were, without careful thought, to pick
memorable moments out of my Grinnell
career, i suppose most of them would be
the had moments ~- the times when i
wasn't sure where l’d fine the strength
to finish the_ job immediately in front of
me, let along the stamina to stay up an-
other 24 hours.

Times like the crisp November day when
C-B—S took over Burling Library, and I
kept wondering, as I worked to cover the
story, whether the work i was doing would
help or hurt Grinnell College...and the
various communities that are a part of it.

Another memory that smnds out sharp
and clear is the day SGA thleatened to
mail a letter to prospective students telling
them about the other side of Grinnell »-
what the SGA leaders saw as the repres~
sive part of the Grinnell experience.

Then there’s the day that I wrote a small
crime story, taken from a police blotter
...and found myself facing two weeks’worth
of threats and harrassment.

But, there are many good times, too. And
in quiet moments like this, these are the
ones that i like to remember.

There is the day I took over as editor
of this newspaper —— full of hope and
ideas. i wasn’t able to hang onto the
hope for long, and some of the ideas
proved impossible to implement.
But I learned, and I grew. And that, too,
is important.
There is the day I wrote that ”now-
famous editorial,” “A Small Town in
Iowa." 1 still feel that way whenever i go
for a late night stroll, or a ride in the
country -- the real Iowa country.
Or, for that matter, whenever I go into
town for a nickel coke or a nickel cup
of coffee. '
There's the day they announced that Grin-

nell had received a grant or more than $4
million dollars to help perpetuate the lib-
eral arts institution as a part ofthe Am-

erican system of higher education. And a
year before, there was a grant of$l mil-
lion.

Some think it strange that I listen toGril'l-
nell's local radio station (KGRN). it start-
ed as part of my news work, but ithas
grown to be something more.

There is something about a small town
radio station reporting each birth with the
pride of a new father and each death with
the sorrow of the local minister thatisbotli ‘
calming and reassuring.

Sure, the programming isn’t the upbeat
music and news those of us from major
metropolitan areas have come to expect.
But it is human ~- and that’s more than

,i can say for many other stations that have
surrendered to rising costs and put in com-
puters to replace human announcers.

At least. with a local station, you can
hear the community talking to itself, with
very little hidden. There'ssomethingdown-
right delightful, at least for me, in hear-
ing the daily jibes at the local chamber
of commerce president, and the running
jokes that are stale and yet still funny.
Sound "corny?” Perhaps I really don’t
belong at Gr‘lnnell. Maybe I’mtoo"square."
I don’t think so. Maybe it's just that I’ve
learned to enjoy some of the simple plea-

. sures of life in a small town as one way

of coping with the daily pressures of cov-
ering this college...tllis town...and this
county.

Whatever it is, l’m glad to be at Grinnell.
l’ll be here another year. Then, back to the
city. But, the experience will follow me.

For those of you who are leaving, lhope
the memories you take away are fond

ones. Be they KGRN and nickel Co—
kes.,.Ron Medvin and R. Marshall
Barber on KDiC...the Grinnell Relays...
Grinnell's perennial talent for losing in
sports...or the Oh Squad that makes losing
fun -- hang on to those memories.

1 know I will.
