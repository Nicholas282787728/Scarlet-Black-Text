NE of the interesting con.
ditions of the promised
gift oi 540,000 to Des Moines Cole
lege, is that $25,000 more must be
raised, trom which a gymnasium
is to be built, This is surely inr
dicative of a great change in the
attitude of the people with regard
to college athletics. A lew years
ago a condition of this Sort would
not have been imposed. We
congratulate our Des Mornes
friends upon their brilliant pros-
pects, and wish them success in
raising the additional amount.
TALK ON ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.
Owing to the unpleasant state
of the weather last night the
audience that listened to Prof.
O'Connor's second lcctule on
Ancient Rome was somewhat
smaller than that which heard the
ﬁrst. There are none ot those
however, who were present last
night who would not gladly come
again to see the same views and
under the same circumstances.
The subject of the talk was
mainly Roman Architecture as
seen in the bridges and temples
and arches that still stand in
various stages of dilapidation,
The views shown were oi the ruins
or restorations after modern archi-
tects. The talk was entertaining
and instructive, not only to stu-
dents ot Latin but to others as
well, as was shown by the goodly
proportion of outsiders in the
audience.

CONCERT AT DEEP RIVER

In spite of the bad weather of
Saturday the Glee Club made its
ﬁrst appearance at Deep River
Saturday night under auspicious
circumstances. A crowded house
greeted the club, and received the
different numbers with enthusiasm
and appreciation. A program of
eleven numbers was arranged, tour
ot which were given by Miss
Laura Rew and Miss Helen
l-Iolden, who were especially well
received. All the numbers on
the program were encored and ex
pressions of pleasure heard on
every hand.

Not one ot the least important
results. was the proﬁt of ﬁfteen
dollars which rewarded the efforts
of those who had the concert in
charge.

Through the generosity oi the

Northwestern, a special carried
the party from Deep River to
Carntorth, where, after a some
what long but not unpleasant wait,
the club boarded the midnight
ﬁyer and soon reached Grintlcll,
fairly well satisﬁed with the even-
ing’s work.
