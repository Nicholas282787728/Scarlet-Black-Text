Women's soccer perfect in MWC

BY NATE LINDSEY

Sremrrmll 'u. . to ride roughshod over, to
overwhelm or squash; “The Grinnell women's
soccer team llmmlo/[rd through the regular
season, repeated as conference champions, and
is looking to win the MWC Tournament this
weekend."

The Pioneers,currentlyranked sixth in the
central Region by D3kicks.com, outscored
conference opponents 37—1 during the season.
They ended the regular season last Sunday
with a 6-0 victory over Lawrence, putting the
team's record at 13-2-1 (9-0-0 MWC).

Gririnell is among the top teams defen-
sively in the nation with the fifthslowest goals
against average (.250) and 13 total shutouts.

Goalkeeper Liz Carrier ’07 allowed just
four goals during the season, aided by defende
er Becca Mackenzie ’09, who earned MWC
Defensive Performer of the Week twice. One
of MacKenzie’s awards came last week when
she helped the Pioneers limit St. Norbert and

Lawrence to a combined 12 shors on goal
while also scoring a goal in each game,

The conference championship is Grinnell's
ninth since 1990. The win against Lawrence
also marked coach Heather Benning’s 100th
victory in her nine seasons as Grinnell’s head
coach.

“I think this has been the most successful
season up to this point [that] I’ve ever been in,"
Kate Diednck'07 said.“It's great it is happene
ing my senior year.“

The Pioneers have a chance to make the
season even more memorable with success in
postseason play, starting when they host the
MWC rournamenr.Their first game is against
Lake Forest College today at 2.00 pm at the
Soccer Complex.

The winner will advance to play the winner
of the St. Norbert and Carroll College game
on Saturday at 11:00 a.m.

The postseason gives the team an Upper
tunity to play for higher stakes, both in the

ch tournament and beyond, after taking
care ofbusiness during the regular season.

"[Repeating as conference champs] felt
really good but at the same time it felt really
natural," Mackenzie said “We deserved every
win we got, it felt like a natural step to he the
champions."

Mackenzie does not see the Pioneers
changing their preparation for the postseason,
but there is one minor setback for the team.

“I think the biggest problem is it’s getting
so dark outside, so we won’t be able to practice
as much,”Mackcnzie said.

Despite the lack of daylight, the team feels
they are well prepared make some noise in both
the conference and national tournaments.

“Going into the MWC tournament I'm
really confident, but in order to win you need
to think that anything can happen,“ Diedrick
said. “We just need to go into the tournament
and work as hard as we have all season not
thinking we have it in the bag,"

Spencer, women harriers dominate

The women’s cross country team dominat-
ed the ch Championships last Saturday,
placing five runners in the top seven. Sarah
Spencer '08 won the individual title to pace
the Pioneers to their third consecutive confer-
ence title.

spcncer dethroned twodlmc defending
champion Erin Kelley ofcarroll by 17 seconds
on her home turf, running a time of 13:35
(5:00 mile pace) over rhe 5k course.

Spencer was followed by teammates Sara
Brady '07 (18:53, third place), Allison Loutr
han '08 (19:13. fourth place), Katie Ryan '07
(19:51, Sixth place) and Becky Bessiiiger '09
(19:58, seventh place).

While only the top five runners score, nine
Pioneers ﬁnished in the top 20 to gainer Alle
conference awards. According to coach Ev-
elyn Freeman, that is an MWC record. The
Pioneers who rounded out the honors were
Erin Sindewald’08,Mcredirh Giovcs'os, Erin
Booth '07 and Rachel Whitﬁeld '10.

Grinncll's success secured them a domi-
nant victory with a team score of 21 points,

Second place Ripon finished with 111 points,
and Beloit and Lake Forest followed closely
with 113 and 115 points, respectively.

The team’s focus on oft-season training was
a big factor in their performance on Saturday.
“The season pretty much started at thl: end of
last spring,"conch Frceman said. “The women
were already excited about our prospects,"

Ryan cvplained that the conference race
was a 5k and that "[the ream has] been having
616 for the majority ofthe season because rhar
is what the regional meet isvve’ve been traine
ing more for a longcr race and when you
throw us into something that's shortcr,l think
some of us still had some left at the end."

The Grinnell women were eager coming
into the conference meet “We were expecting
to win, I think," Ryan said. “Throughout the
season, [the MWC website] posts the time
ofall of the teams in the conference, and you
sort ofhave a comparison. Looking at that, we
could kind ofsee that we were favored."

The next stop on the road to Nationals is
the NCAA Midwest Regional meet in North—
field, Minn., on Nov. 11.

Coach Freeman is optimistic about the
chances of the team at Regionals. “it still looks
like we’re in pretty good shape to qualify, and
our times stack up as well, ifnot better, than all
ofthe teams in our rcgion,"she said.

Changes have been made to the way teams
qualify for Nationals this year. The top two
teams from each ofthe eight NCAA Regional
mccts will receive invites; in the past, the num-
ber of reruns was determined by the region's
success at the previous year's nationals. Addi-
tional at‘largc teams will also qualify based on
ranking and performance.

Grinnell college has never sent a team to
Nationals, although individual runners have
qualified to run Qialifyirig reams send seven
runners plus one alternate.

Whether Grinnell qualities to send a team
or not, Freeman is positive about the impor-
tance of the experience to her runners "We’re
very blessed with a large number of very tal-
enred athletes, and they're working hard," she
said. “They're very supportive ofeach other, it

very citing and we're trying to relish the
cxpclicncc as best we can."

Men’s cross
country claims
10th straight
MWC title

Drake Ballew ’08 takes
individual crown as team
ties for top spot

av ALLIE GREENBERG

The men's cross country ream will head
into the NCAA Regional incct on Nov. 11 af-
tei a tie for first place at the Midwest confer-
cncc Championship in Waukesha, wisc., last
weekend. The Pioneers pldccd three runners
in the top 10 and all five - orers in the top
is en route to winning their 10th consecutive
MWC team title.

Drake Ballcw '08 won.thc individual title
with a time of 25:41 (5:10emilc pace). The
other scorers were David M Montgoincry'll)
(third). Henry Riech '09 (siath). Sam Calisch
'10 (12th) and Charlie Knuth ’08 (14th).

Pioneers also finishing among the top 50
out of the 114 runners were Nick Sprrrr ’09
(16th), and Paul Belloia '10 (let). Mike HOP
iell '09 (24th), Mike Van I'lullc '07 (Sist), Kyle
Lyncl‘rKlutup ’10 (39th), Ben Ztrrov'10(43rd)
and Anders Ahlbcrg’10(49rh).

“People think that it's tough to win a con—
ference title, and it is tough to win a conference
title, but to keep winning it gets progressively
more diﬂicult,"said coach Will Freeman.

An added difficulty, Freeman said, is the
relative youth of this year's team. “Our top four
runners [from last season] were not back," he
said “It was, in a way, a rebuilding year, and yet
I knew we had mlCnl.1('5 a young team, but a
very talented team.“

Monmouth’s fourth and fifth runners f‘ii‘r
ished ninth and 10th, while Grinnell's fourth
and fifth runners ﬁnished 12th and 14th, a
spread that allowed Monmouth to tie Grinnell
despite the Pioneers nabbing two of the top
three spots.

“You can ovemnalyze it and try to ﬁgure
‘wcll, we could have gained a point here and
a point there,'but it does no good," said Free-
man. “Wejust need to recognize that we ran a
really good, solid race with a young team, and
we‘re real happy with it."

Ballew said that the tie was not as reward-
ing as a sole title would have been but was
still special. “It'll mean more to me next year
when it hits my perspective that we've won it
so many times," he said “[A conference title]
really rs, especially when you tie and have such
a close call, something to be cherished and res
spected ”

Reich pointed to the importance of the
team’s title in terms of upholding Grinnell’s
tradition.

“It‘s a team sport," Reich said. “I know
you have individual champions and individual
competition, but it’s also the idea of continued
evcellencc in running. That's a really impor-
tant thing to the team is this tradition ofdoing
well in the conference."

With tough competition ahead, Ballew
hopes that the team will have a strong showing
at Regionals. “There’s a lot of really talented
runners in the region," he said. About his in-
dividual performance, he hopes to “just get in
there and mix it up with the best of them and
see what happens."

Reich thinks Grinnell's team is “anywhere
from fifth to 10th in the region .. . Who knows
what will happen, it depends on whether or
not we have a good race."

Freeman believes the team can compete at
a higher level than they have so far this season.
“I really think our best race is ahead of us," he
said, “and hopefully it will be on that week
end at St. Olafand we’ll grab one ofthosc fivc
spots,” referring to qualifying for Nationals at
the Regional meet.
