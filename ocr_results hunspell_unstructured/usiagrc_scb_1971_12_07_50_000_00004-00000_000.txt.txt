leggett Statement On Black Agreements}

Glenn Leggett, President

TO:
FROM:

At this Juncture, we can only spe-
culate on or hope eventually to un-
derstand the immediate sources oi
pressure which impelled the black
students to take the action they took
at Burling Library on the morning
of Monday, November 29, 1971.
There is no question that the Cole
lege had been concerned about pron
blems affecting these students and
had been dealing with them for se-
veral months. But there is also no
question that the still-small num-
ber of blacks at this and other 001*
leges makes them the victims of
irustrations which are not easily ap-
prehended or understood by others
either on or off campus.

Certainly in conironting the sit—
uation at the library on Monday
morning, i made a deliberate eiiort
at understanding what the attitude of
the black students was at that mo,
ment. As I made this effort, I
ieit, too, that I was avoiding pre-
cipitate action that could have had
the effect of escalating the pro—
blem. The students were not ex—
hihiting anger. They showed not
the slightest tendency toward vice
lence. They were not disrespect~
ful or discourteous. They simply
maintained that a number of things
had to be done to relieve their
doubts about their survival as stu-
dents and persons on this campus.

My first job, accordingly, was to
get into the building and to find out
what these students meant by their
demands, most of which, as I told
them at the time, were impossible
to grant. They replied that their
grievances nevertheless pointed up
the need for certain additional pro-
cedures and policies that they felt
must be instituted to insure the
continued viability of the black com—
munity on campus

Upon being admitted to the builds
ing, I called our Dean of Adminis-
tration and the Dean of the College
who joined me in the library, as
did the Dean of Student Afiairs la»
ter in the morning. We sat down
with a delegation of the black stu-
dents and asked them to explain their
grievances so that there could be
some understanding of the motiva-
tion for their actions In the course
of these discussions, I felt that two
things became Clear: first, to the
students, that the demands were
more qualified than they sounded;
and second, to us (the deans and
myself), that certain matters needs
ed to be looked into so thatthe black
students might continue to move for-
ward educationally and personally as
equal members of the college com-
munity.

In our discussions, I informed the
students that in one or two instances
their complaints, as stated, were be
ing dealt with or would be dealt with
through existing policy and proce-
dures. They accepted this state-
ment and said that their main con»
cern at this time was in improv-
ing the structures by which pros»
pective black students could be Ids
entified, recruited, and admitted to
the college, I agreed with them that
this was of primary importance.

After these clarifications had been
made, I considered that the period
of discussion was over and told the
students that, though the remaining
matters in a revised form could be
discussed, 1 did not intend to hold
such deliberations until the doors of
Burling Library were opened and the
building restored to normal use. The

delegation oi students in my oiiice
iniormed the general group oi this
stipulation and returned to say they
would comply, By 12:15 pm the
doors were opened andby lZ'SOp.m.
the black students had leit the build
ing and Burling was in normal opee
ration,

There had been no'violence oi any
kind, no damage whatsoever to the
building or its contents, and no dis-
courtesies shown to the deans or
myseli during the morning’s events.
Thus, though the building should not
have been occupied and closed as
it was, i tell that, because the stu-
dents had acted out of an obvious
sense of distress rather than oi anr
ger, and, above all,becausetheyhad
opened the library at the time l
stipulated, no disciplinary action
would be taken against the indivi-
duals involved.
since these events took place, there
have been continuing discussions
which have been productive and im-
portant for the college community
as a whole, The grievances orir
ginally presented as demands have
been tempered and submitted to the
college as issues lending themselves
to ieasibie resolution, Representa—
tions of all at the constituencies on
campus--students, iaculty, and
staiie-have entered into these dis-
cussions and generally support the
need for close consideration at the
ongoing concerns oi black students
in a predominantly white culture,
To any judgment, then, oi the way
an administration acts in response
to precipitate action must be added
a consideration oi the eventual out
come. I believe that our steps due
ring and aiter the incident on Noe
vember 29, 1971 were, and continue
to be, careiui and jusidicous, with no
abandonment oi the established or-
derly procedures ior handling mate
ters aiiecting college policy. All
discussions subsequent to the No-
vember 29 conversations in Burling
have been under the auspices oi re-
gularly constituted iaculty, student,
and administrative committees and
bodies, and without any coercion.
i would add to this only that we
continue to live in difficult times,
and i believe that all oi us will
agree that iorbearance and under
standing are not yet obsolete modes
oi operation. Although we cannot
tolerate violence, neither will we
turn our backs without listening whr
enver real pressures confront any
of our students and call ior immer
diate concern and attention,

AS {or the substantive results of
vember 29 and December a in re
sponse to the revised demands pre-
sented by the black students, the
ioiiowing resolutions have been
made and are here recorded ior the
information or the campus com
munity, They have been approved,
where appropriate, by the Execu—
tive Committee oi the Board oi
Trustees. The resolutions are cerr
iainiy not all that can be done to
improve the situation oi the black
students. But they are steps ior-
ward: steps that are not simply
acceptable to these students but
bases on which further work can be
done to improvethe living and learns
ing conditions oi both the black and
white communities The rest is in
the minds and hearts oiall members
of the college community-4o build
and maintain attitudes of genuine
concern and to prove opportunities
ior communication and open discus-
sion that will lead to a stronger
sense oi unity and harmony among
us.

This proposal was then presented
to the Faculty in a Special faculty
meeting on Thursday 2 December.
This proposal provided for an A -
missions Board for Black Students:

This Admissions Board will have
as its plimary duty the deciding
of all special cases in the area
of black admissions that fall out»
side the guidelines set by the
admissions policy. It will also
have the Same duties that are now
assigned to the present AdmiSr

Board ior Black Students.

Black Committee Representation

On the demand for a black stu-
dent on every committee or coun-
cil: in our discussions it became
clear that what was meant here was
that there be a black student re,
presentative on every committee in
which there is presently student
representation.

After further discussion, it was
agreed that CBS might contact the
chairman of any such committee to
learn the times of meetings and
might send an observer from CBS
to the committee meetings, In the
case oi the Freshman iiear Program
Committee, we agreed to present to
the Faculty a request that there be
an official member of that Com-
mittee representing the black Stu-
dents. This proposal will go to the
Faculty in its meeting on Monday.

Black Student-Faculty Review Board

After discussion with the represen»
tatives of CBS, it was agreed that

the present machinery regarding
student complaints in respect to ia-
culty would be adequate in bringing
to the attention of the Chairman of
the Faculty and the Dean of the Col-
lege instances in which black stu-
dents may have legitimate com-
plaints against certain faculty
members, )ust as all students prer
sently have the right to register such
complaints.

Ofﬁcial Meetings on Black
Community Problems
That no official meetings be held
discussing the black community on
this campus without a black spokes-
man present, this issue came up
very early in our discussion and it
was agreed that whenever there are
broad policy matters under consir
deration that affect the black
community, a spokesman ior that
community will be present to par-
ticipate in the discussions.

Black Studies Major

The immediate institution of a
Black Studies major: after discus-
sion it was agreed that the Dean
oi the College would appoint an
ad hoc committee consisting of far
culty and students to draw up apro—
posal for a Black Studies major wh-
ich would be presented to the allr
College Educational Policies Come
mittee in the first weeks of the
second semester for its considerav
tion and recommendation to the Far
culty.

Institution of I Black Library

We presently have a bibliography
oi our holdings in the area of M-
rican/Afro-American Studies. Af-
ter discussion, it was agreed that
the most important and current
books in that collection would be
kept in an open reserve section of
the library and that representatives
of CBS, working with Mrs. Wyly,
would establish this section in near
future. It was further agreed that
the present audiorvlsual equipment
available to all Students will, of
course, be available to‘bla'ck stu-
dents.

which is a subcommittee of the 306‘
