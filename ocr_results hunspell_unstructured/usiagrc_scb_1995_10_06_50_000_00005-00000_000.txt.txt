The plot is predictable, but
Arau’s directing lifts it up out of the
mundane. Candy salesman FaulSut—
ton (Reeves) meets a sobbing Victo—
ria Aragon. (Spanish actress Aitana
Sanchez—Gi’on) and discovers that
she is pregnant. Victoria is afraid to
go home to her family’s Vineyard
because her conservative Mexican
father “'1” kill her ifshe comes home
pregnant and without a husband.
Paul volunteers to pose as her has
band for a day and then leave her,
protecting Victoria's image with her
family. Ofcourse, Paul is unable to
esoape and is gradually drawn into
the family.

A Walk in the Clouds is Arau's
Hollywood dehut. Aftct directing
the foteign film Like WaterforClioc—
olare. Arari has highstandards to live
up to, and he doesso beautifully. The
only problem is that because it is a
Hollywood film. Iguess they thought
they needed a big name actor to sell
it. This is unfortunate. Perhaps it
they hadn't picked Reeves, an actor
ivrth depth of emotion could have
been chosen,

Arau's cinematography is filled
with light. The setting ofthe family
vineyard is up in the mountains of
California. and mist and sunlight fill
every scene One of my favorite
scenes was when the grapes became

of large white fans to push the hot air
down onto the grapes. The camera
pulls back to show the lush valley
and the workers gently pushing their
fans down like angels in a valley,
Arau has created a picture of heaven
in A Walk in the Clouds.

Reeves is outofhis league when
he talks with the family grandfather,
played by Anthony Quinn. Lending
a sage wisdom and goofiness to his
part, Quinn seems to lead Reeves by
the hand in a lesson on good aering.
Every time Reeves tries to leave the
vineyard, Quinn pulls him back for a
walk to sample the chocolates or
