After Rain

Squares of gloomy blue
cut by window frames
cast their dying hue
through rain—streaked window panes.

From/a frenzied, fading storm
shadows gather in,

a score of drunken, careless drops
gurgle on gutter’s tin.

After-rain blues turn softly dark
their frames grow weak and dim,
the night grasps all without
and discreetly, all within.

Janet Hamilton
