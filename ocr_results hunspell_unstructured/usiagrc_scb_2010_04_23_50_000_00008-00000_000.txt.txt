Read aloud in the library

BY CAROLlN SclloLz

There is probably no better place to read poetry and fiC’
tion than a library, where much of“: has come to life.This
pasr Wednesday, as parr or the Wednesday at Burling ser
ties, four Grinnell College seniors, Molly Rideout ’10, Paul
Bellota '10, Lawrence Sumulong ’10 who serves as photo
editor for the 5&5 and Lucy Schiller
’10 presented selections from their work
that dealt with topics such as the life of
a ﬁctional’character at Grinnell College
or rhe perspective ofa dead dog. Rideout
and Bellota read excerpts of their ﬁction
while sumulong and Schiller presented
an array of their poetry-The series was
organized by Collection Development
and Preservation Librarian Rebecca Stuhr who had this
event in mind when she approached some of the students
as early as last fall. “I liked the idea of students showing
their work where they wrote some of it," Stuhr said.

While presenting two of her poems, Lucy Schiller told
the audience that her Alt Break trip to South Dakota,
and the state's uncanny poverty and beauty, inspired her
to write two of the poems. For Sumulong, the events of
his life, but also photographs. have caused him to express
himselfin poetry.

“A lot of my inspiration comes from mishearing peo-

_ ”There are hilarious WWI/OHS (hm I
want to puI into a story,”

pic," Rideout said. “And then I realize what they have said
which is by far not as rool as whirl thought they said, sol
make that into a story."

Like poetry, the authors found inspiration for their ﬁc-
tion in an number of places. “I draw my inspiration mainly
from music but also life," Bellora said. One of the ﬁction
pieces he read was a completely
ﬁctional story set in and probe
ably inspired by things going on
in Grinnell College. 'There are
hilarious situations that I want to
put into a story,” Bellora said.

The turnout for the reading
was great, more than [he provided
juice and cookies could really ac-
count for. About 50 people showed up in the Comer ofBur-
ling to enjoy the readings—some simply to listen, others to
support friends.

“It's good ro support people who do art," said Lucy Rea
ese '10, who attended the reading,

Even though the reading's location near Butling's en-
trance and the activity of the library sometimes created
distractions, the event showed how substantial a place po—
etry and ﬁction have in the Grinnell community.
