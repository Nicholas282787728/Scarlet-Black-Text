THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By MAX ROSS

Although they weakened in the
final minutes, the Pioneer basketball
quintet played its best game of the
season against Washington Monday

night. It remained for a bit of ex-‘

pensive guessing on the part of tire
officials to demoralize them, but this
should in no way detract from the
splendid Washington rally which gave
the Bears ado—3 scoring advantage
during the last ten minutes of the

second half.

iProfessdr Discusses War

Debts at Sunday, Club

“The 22 billion dollars that debtor
notions owe the United states, in
‘ principal and interest. will never be
maid in full," stated Prof. R. B.
‘MCClenon in a talk on “War Debts"
‘hefore the Sunday Evening club, on
the second floor of the Y associations
building, Sunday at 7:30 p. m.
Quoting several well known ecos
nomists, Professor McClenon explain-
ed that under existing conditions we
cannot expect full payment of our
war debts and he concluded by gi ing
one of the proposed plans for partial
payment. 1
Amer-icon Attitude Unjustifled
“The popular American attitude to
collect every last cent is unjustified."
asserted the mathematics instructor.
it is unjust because we loaned money
on a Semiraltrul'stic or charitable
basis, but, he continued, Europe's at-
titude of calling America "Shylock"
is also unjustified since they were
overjoyed to borrow our funds dllrs
ing the war The loans were made
with good feelings from both the
debtor and creditor nations, but the
trouble has come from the fact that
since that timc the debts have been
reduced to a strictly business ha.
Proposes Plan
The plan presented by Professor
McClenon proposes that whatever
amount the nations pay should be in
accordance to their capacity to pay.
This money would be used to set up
credit at an international bank at
Basel, Switzerland, and the credit or
money thus gained would be used in
financing international students and
such large scale improvements as
the Panama canal, Beside benefiting
the world at large these projects
would give employment to the job-
less in both creditor and debtor na-
ticns.
