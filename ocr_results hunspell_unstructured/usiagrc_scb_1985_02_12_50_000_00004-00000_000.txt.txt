Main. is used only ior storage. Due to the
restrictions of the fire code the building
has remained unoccupied tor 7 years.

Executive Vice-president Waldo Walker
said the delay was due to a lack of funds.

“We have been grappling for 6'»; years
now on how we were going to fund the
renovation of it." Walker further explain
ed that the accumulation of designated
giits irom a iew individuals along with the
deteriorating condition of the building has
made renovation at the present time feasi-

the position will be filled by the 1986787
academic year. The chair will be fully en-
dowed by Joseph Roseniield. long-time
college trustee and benefactor. and Des
Moines businessman.

Most faculty members and ad-
ministrators involved with the develop
ment of the position feel mat it will take
until this summer to decide on the
specifications and qualifications ior die
position. Aiter the specifications are set
the national search will begin. probably
next fall, according to Dean of Faculty
Catherine Frazer.

Frazer said that the college administra-
tion's responsibility will include “con-
sulting with interested faculty and others
on campus" and noted that several depart-
ments have been giving advice on the mat-
ter already. She also said that the ad
ministration will be consulting with an ad
hoc committee on Women’s Studies
chaired by Rosenfield Professor Joe Wall,
the Executive Council, and also “Women’s
Studies research centers like the Wellesley
Women’s Studies Center.” She said after

Both Mears Hall and Goodnow viel‘c

structure. while the masonry and wood

weathering.

Renovation Will involve very IiltIe alter

shell. including the later addition (it the
north wing. will remain unchanged. Even
the original iloor plan will be kept with a
few alterations to provide tor seminar and
conference rooms, The fireplaces will re-
main and much of the original molding and
trim will be used. Efforts will also be made
to up grade the building by installing in
sulation and reiniorcing structural sup
ports.

The primary aim oi renovation is to ac
commodate the needs of the Admissions
Oifice. The modifications necessary to cute
lit the hall ior dormitory use required by
the tire code would be too costly. Further»
more, the administration sees no need tor
additional housing. Presently coniined to

Frazer noted that the deiinition oi the
position, the department the chair will be
located in, and the responsibilities oi the
position still have to be worked out belore
the search ior candidates is started.

Also at question is whether the appoint
ment should be a junior or seniorrlevel
position — Le. a person starting out and
still building their reputation. or an
already established ieminist scholar. have
ing taught and published widely Opinions
on this and on the question oi department
and curriculum were divided.

Frazer said she thought that the position
is “not really a junior appointment, not a
very beginning beginner," She added that
the person should be “someone with
scholarly commitment and expertise in
ieminist studies in a whole variety oi
iields." She indicated that the person need
not be an established scholar. but might
ideally be a “rising young scholar" with
great potential.

Frazer also noted that protessors irom
several departments including Ann
thropology, English, History, Sociology,
and Philosophy had shown an interest in
locating the new position within their
department.
