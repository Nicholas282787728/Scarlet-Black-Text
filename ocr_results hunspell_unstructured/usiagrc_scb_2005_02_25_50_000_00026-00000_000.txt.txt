Time warp: tracmg roots of Self-government

In order to uncovei the history of f’gm’clndncc .it tllis
institution, I spent .- it al hours today ~lcunining tlueagli ini-
ci-oi‘thn in basement or Bin-ling, it you've never matured into
the Microfilm Room (right next to the Listening Room), you
really should. he a \voncleitiil place quiet, dark, lonely .. good
for homework, bad fol mental health Be sure to take hieaks
cverv hou '

But I digress,

I waded thiough issues ofthe 55519 (or 77» Re-
par/er if this s spring arm), daring t’ioiu FaLl
1966 through spring 1971.1 iignrcd this was the
right time period to study I could easily covci-
selftgovelnancc from its meager beginnings
through its implementation and the immediate
aftermath.

What I had naively e 'pectcd to iind, but
did not, was an academic treatment of the
development of self-governance. Of course,
it's hard to write about history while in the
midst of making it, so what I found was a
smattering of articles regarding such is
sues as ‘loggia locks,“woincn’s hours’ and ‘wccktiay visitaticns,’
Through these articles,l pieced together wliatl believe is the
historical context ofsclfrgovernilllce. (I should have been a his-
tory major.)

In an effort not to lose my sanity, I only looked at one roll
of microfilm, the 1966 to 1971 roll. Hence, I do not know when
these issues began to surface. suffice it to say that, for my pur-
poses, selftgovcmance began with an incident of illegal visitir
tioii sometime during the end of October and the beginning of
November 1966.

LAURA LABEDZ

At that tulle, only men \veie .illoiivcd to have all campus
apartments and they were not allowed to have female visito
over, except at specilictl time, Noncrhtless, onc clay, two women
and two then, ended up: an apartment together, One woman
and one man were dating and] believe, the other man was
trying to ‘liook up' (to use niotletn lingo) with the other gill.
Unfortunately, the latter girl was mentally ill and her recently

cxed boyfriend was concerned about her health and followed

her to the apartment to try and get her help. He ended up

calling in an administrator.

In the places of getting the gill the nece Sm‘y hclp

(she was trunsporrcd to the psychiatric hospital in Neiw

ton and eventually taken home by her father). the admin

istiation discovered that the nonnmentally ill students

weie in direct VlDllKlOl‘i of Visitation inles that had

been in place {or a long time. These tlliee students

stood trial in front ofa‘court'of faculty meme

hers and were expelled for thc rest of that scr
inestcr, as well as the following one.

To those of us living in the ‘New Mille-
nitirn,’ suspension for ‘visitation' (not to incur
tion the entire concept of‘visitiition') seems ludicrous Well, it
seemed iidiculous to students living in the 1960s as well. And
those students were fiu‘ious.

What followed \veie nlanv attacks on the college’s visitation
policu One columnist that vear referred to Grinnell College
as a ticfdom and questioned when it would dispose of its fete
dal ways. 'Editoi‘ials in the SEE, tor the most part, complained
about the outdated, stifling policies of tl‘ic college and ques-
tioned whether the school had the right to govern studcrits'sex
lives. Giycn the generally slow nature ofiustitutional change,

 

students originally pushed for extended visitation periods.

in the inllowing years, howetcr, other issues came up stirs
dents wanted open dorms in which members of both sexes
could go and just hang out at any time. Also, keeping the south
Campus loggla doors locked overnight was a the hazard and
lust outright illegal according to state fire codc it was also ins
crcdihly >C,\IS|, and students wanted to abolish the restriction
defining when women could be Oulﬁldc of the South Campus
loggia The mens (i0! ms were also having problems with haz-
ing activ , By 1970, the North and south campuses wcrc
integrated

Concurrently, students were demanding more control over
major deciSions made by the institution specifically curiicu-
lum ielated decisions. They felt that faculty had too much coll-
trol over the college and wanted more student involvement on
committees.

Finally, students had issues with the model ofrcsidence life.
They wanted advisors who actually had counseling degrees and
they wanted students to he able to go to rhcsc advisors for help
without fear of administrative punishment for their actions.
They also wanted the student advisor position (which had a
different name heroic 1970) to be more focused on helping sni—
dents and less focused on iules and policies. Sound familiar? It
was out or this that self-governance was born.

I’low, exactly> That's for next time, For now, we know that
the college has placed ‘cnlphasis in discussion .on the individr
nal, his needs and...potentialities and the importance of per-
mirring him to. develop rhcm,“Allowing the snidcnrs .rree-
doln ofchoicc becomes a necessary, calculated risk ”WSW/cf

Confusion over buffer days

As I rcad the minutes from a recent Joint Board meeting
grew very confused It said that the College Curriculum Commit1
tee did not believe that adding buffer (reading) days before exams
week would ieduce student stress. Iwas conﬁised because a Sept.
17, 2004 5653 article states that the Col scling Taslt Force on
Mental Health had recommended the add ion ofhuffcr days,

I e-mailed Tom Ctady about the issue and he replied, “The
Counseling Task Force made the recommendation in an effort to
dotcsc'ilatc stress on campus since it tends to increase at the end
of the semester." He also kindly sent me a list of the rccommcndw
Lions of the Counseling Task Foice, and lo and behold the very
first recommendation was to‘ c‘reate reading days between the end
of classes and the beginning offinrtls."

So do buffer days relieve stress or not? Who is right 7 the
Counseling Task Force or the Curriculum Committee? I talked
with a student who was on the Curriculum Committee about the
issue, He gave several arguments against buffer days, He said that
many students would not use those buffer days to study but would
instead party.I argued that although some would invariably misuse
those days, is that fair to penalize the rest of campus and deprive
them ofilwaluablc study and decompression time> 1 think not.

The student also argued that the greatest challenge may be a
logistical one. He claimed that there were too many scheduling
conflicts and that adding buffer days (even just one and making a
four day finals week) would mean changes that neither the Reg-ism
trar not the professors wanted to make, It could mess up graduat
tion or mean not enough science labs or even cause Armageddon.

Seriously, if the biggest obstacle to healthy students is not
wanting to rearrange a ﬂicking schedule, than I suppose] must
accept what I have long wished false, that this school does not care
one bit about its students. And its actions reﬂect that truth:

1) The sudden removal of PLANS

2) The removal otsouthcrn Express

3) The sudden smoking ban (albeit many students do dcsire

this)

4) The 5.5% tuition increase

5) And there is still no fucking rootovcr the Hindu God

Gancsh

I do not believe the issue is about reducing stress or making life
better for students. It is about what is best for the admiiusttation,
plain and simple. In the aforementioned 8&3 article, Dean of the
College Jim Swarm states “This issue has started twrcc in my six
years here and the students have been ovenvhclrningly opposed
both times. "Fair enough. In last semesters initiative 83. 7% of the
students voted in favor oradding a buffer day.

But you know what. maybe you should just rorgct ovcrythiugl
have argued; the only thing that seems to matter for the adminis
tration is what our peer institutions do, Fortunately for us, about a
dozen otout peer institutions do have buffer days, even Carleton.

Demand whole
and fresh foods

Dear Fellow Grinncllians,

As many of us know, barely a meal goes by in either dining
hall without hearing some complaint about the variety or qual-
ity of the food. Many of us resort to bagels, a salad or just cereal
at nearly every meal. Others choose not to ear in the dining halls
despite the huge cost of the prepaid dining plan,I believe that the
mediocre quality of dining hall food is a major dmwhack to this
institution Eating is more than' Jusf putting proteins and starches
in our stomachs. Food is about complete nutrition and most im
poitandy, enjoyment. For food to be truly healthy, it must be fresh
and whole It is not enough to simply have a wide variety or items
ifthey all are n primarily refined starches nou local, nomorganic,
nontseasonal and highly processed. These foods may not be bad
for you but they certainly could be better.

I propose that we, as a student body, demand diar Dining sei-
viccs serve higher quality. healthier food. To do this, it must use
local, seasonal. whole, freerangc, and organic ingredients wherever
possible, in all the food it providesTlicic are many reasons why
this should be done, including but not limited to: putting money
back in the hands ofthe food producers and local communi es, re-
ducing fuel emissions from food transport, ceasing to support the
oppressive labor policies of many agribusiness and factory farms.
Furthermore, local and whole food is fresher, healthier and tastier.
It also is less likely to contain unknown ingredients or contami-
nants.

The link between nutritioni notjust macronutrients, but min
cronutricnts found in fresh vegetables and whole grains as well as
the percentages of essential fatty acids in free-range animals— and
cognition is well documented. Indivrduals who eat well think bet-
ter, act better, feel better and are happier. Since the College ad
ministration is supposedly so concerned about our mental health,
adjusting food policy to foster greater wellness should be number
one on their list. Sure, eating a carrot with the skin on it may seem
unfamiliar at first, and a free range chickcn will actually taste like
muscles that have been used opposed to the flavorless antibiotiCt
ridden chickens served in the dinning halls. However, this is only
because many of us have not been exposed to foods that have not
been ovei'tproccssed or humanely raised. lryou want your money
to be used responsibly, then please demand that the Grinnell Cole
lege administration make sewing good food a priority,

Equally as important as changing the foods iS changing at
titudes about food. Unsustainablo agriculture is perhaps one of the
most virulent destructive forccs on the planet. it is not acceptable
to iely on “conventional" food because it “costs less’CThe costs in

the long term are astronomical. Grinnell College needs takes its
place along with other progiessive institutions and be a model for
how Dining services can overcome the challenges associated with
fostering a new food sysreruThis is not to say that Dining scru'ccs
is not trying or even disagrees with much of the content in this
letter,jiist that moie needs to done. If you are interested in feeling
better and enjoying your food then demand an increase in Dining
Scrvices' use of local, frccrrangc. whole and organic food Better
yet tell student atraus and RKO that ifthey want a healthy student
body that local whole and fresh is the way to gol Ifwellbeing is ten
ally a priority for them then supporting these ideas through action
is the best way to show it.
