0 Death Comes to the Gym.

As it must to all gyms, death comes Monday
might to the old Grinnell gym, for fifty
years the scene of many athletic contests.
TIlis makes Monday night a doubly special
night, for the Drake Bulldog plays here.
Despite the consistent you/lingy about the
gym, there comes a feeling of sadness when
we think that its active life is over. Some

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

01' the great teams of the country have gone
down before the Pioneers in that gym, and
although Drake has not got one of the great
teams of the country, we trust that the re»
sult will be no different.

The gym is not the only thing- bowing
out Monday night. Also on the boards for
the last time will be four seniors. Captain
Paul Paterson, Hugh McCartney, Ralph
Young'sl rum, and Doll Hock are makng their
final itppr‘arance. Each of them has done
much to\ ’il'd making a good season, a good
team.

Yet in the face of such groups of senti-
ment, all we can say is BEAT
DRAKE: I ! !

O Harmony at Home.

Speaking of Union Now, the orchestra cone
cert Sunday afternoon should prove a con-
crete example of what can be accomplished
in one field at least through the amalgama-
tion of three or four neighboring communi-
ties. The best player from a radius of sev-
eral miles around Gr nell will participate in
what is hoped will eventually become a
symphony orchestra for all of central Iowa.

This project, though still embryonic, puts
an entirely different aspect on the future 01"
good music presented first hand to sympa-
thetic audiences in the various communities
represented. One really first rate orchestra
rather than a number of inadequate and
poorly balanced ones is a noteworthy achieve—
ment for any area.

The ultimate success of ths venture will
mean another triumph for that interncom-
mllnity spirit of cooperation and good will
that is so essential for enduring national
integration

To the Editor:

During the months in which 1
have hccn in service the Scarlet
and Black has given me great
pleasure and has helped to keep
Grinnell alive for me. It seems
that the paper has continued its
high type reporting.

In the issue of February 17,
then: appeared an editorial com-
menting on a university of Chi-
cage poll. This poll, you say.
found that "Non-ROTC schools
have overlooked the fact that
specialized training is of no value
to a prospective fighting man un-
less accompanied by basic milic
tary training.” I hope the soap
let and Black does not bclicve

War Shortage

Anticipating the war paper
shortage, the stenographic bu-
rea‘n has purchased a year's sup—
ply of ink. onion skin paper, bond
paper, tc., according to Selden
Norris. director,

Over 1200 reams of different
sizes and shapes of mimcogrcph
paper were included, In the strict
stationery line, $2500 worth of
typewriter paper and envelopes
were purchased, Norris added.

Mimeogrcph paper that cost 51
cents a ream last June, now
wholesales for 73 cents a ram.
ASIde from the rise in prices, it
is now impossible to obtain any
red, green, or orchid colored pa-
per, but it is still possible to buy

that.

In all branches of the army at
man who has had specialized
training of some kind will find
himself heads above those who
have not. The army nccds train-
ed men. 1: they can’t get them
they have to train them. Natural-
ly, a man who has something
to give the army in addition to
his mere presence will be reward-
ed. These rewards usually come
in the form of responsible posi—
tions at increased salaries.

This training, however, does not
have to be accompanied by basic
military training. That the army
can give a man easily. So please
don’t discourage the American
colleges’ movement toward prc-
military training subjects. It is a
very Worthy project.

With 3625 invested in the au-

chances of getting any new parts,
it will be necessary to treat the

Norris warned. But with 60,000

million different forms, bulletins,
