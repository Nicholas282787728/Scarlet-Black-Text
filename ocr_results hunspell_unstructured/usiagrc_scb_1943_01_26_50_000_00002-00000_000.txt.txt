The Lasl Tuesday-~-

With this issue, the Scarlet and Black en-
ters a new phase, one that the editors sin—
cerely hope will be only temporary.

For the rest of the semester, beginning
next week, the S & B will be printed once
a week instead of the traditional twice.
This action is taken after a long period of
discussion, and after consultation \lith repc
resentative students, faculty and adminis»
trative officers.

The change is motivated by four considv
erations.

First, the instability of student enroll-

mentl So far, Grinnell has been exceedingly
lucky in maintaining a student body of ap-
proximately the same size since September.
But such luck is not assur d for the rest
of the year. One college official’s estimate
of a loss of 80 to 100 students is considered
conservative, None at all may go, but per—
haps 80 will. Some of those men are impor-
tant members of this paper’s staff. It would
be difficult to replace them. It would be
virtually impossible to double the amount
of work of remaining staff members Their
first consideration is, quite properly, their
college education The Scarlet and Black is
an extra curricular activity and must re-
main such.
‘ The smaller enrollment means also a. loss
in income for this paper. That is an impor-
tant consideration, but even more important
is the loss of news. Two campus org m a—
tions have already declared a morato um
ior the duration, Three others are definitely
considering doing so. That means less news
to be repor ed.

The organizations remaining are concen—
trating their efforts on war work. This
move is an intelligent and admirable one,
But it does mean one story on the Grinnell
war program every issue instead of a dozen
or two stories on divergent activities,

Secondly. the fluctuations of advertising,
Thus far, the Scarlet and Black has shown
a comfortable profitl We don’t know how
long that can continue, But we do know
that we can give our advertisers much bet,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the college and this paper, if we print one
large issue every week. Page makeup on a

s. or eight-page issue will be more advan- ‘

tageolls for both news alid advertising copy.

Thirdly, the I'Ieraldrllegistcr printing conic
pally is facing the same severe shortage of
tr incd men as every other newspaper plant
ill the country. The printing of the Scarlet
and Black has hitherto used the entire conr
posing room facili ies two days a week. The
extra day now available to them \l ill allevi-
ate their labor shortage. ,

Fourtlily, the possible curtailment of news—
print. This is the factor in the future of
the Scarlet and Black as well as any other
paper We have enough to print one issue
per week for the rest of the year. Some of
that may be taken away from us, and even
more drastic printing curtailment may have
to be made,

But for the time being, a single weekly
issue seems the wisest move for all cone

ll Does Happen Here---

What did you think when you read in the
Sunday papers about the explosion of the
small Navy boat in the Chicago river".7 One
man has died and there were several seri-
ous injuries, Just one of those things? Unv
avoidable? Law of averages? Carelessness?
True, any one of these might have been
the reason for the destruction of the craft,
Did you think of sabotage. Yes, sabotage
in the heart of the midwest, thousands of
miles from the fighting fronts, The enemy
governments have been, and still are wag-
ing one of their most desperate fights
against America through their numerous
underground spy and sabotage networks.
There is a book in our library in the
rental collection that should be read by
everybodyiespecially those who believe
that here we are safe from all types of at
tackiphysical and mental. This book, “Sa»
botagc, the Secret War Against America,"
by Michael Sayers and Albert E. alin, coli-
colltains facts; facts that will make you sit
up and think hard. These men are noted for
their research and exposition of Axis agents.
They quote records, letters, contracts, and
memos that have been siezed by the Dev
partineiit of Justice and their own investi-
gatols. They tell stories about citizens of
the United States including Senators, reple—
scntatives, prominent people and most of
all, oiganizations that have fostered the
fascist doctrines of the United States for
the purpose of undermining our mor le,
“Divide and conquer,” is their creed, De-
stroy when possible is another. The ‘chlLlVl‘
ties of Mr. Lindberg were most revealing.
The fiiie object lesson this book reveals
in its expose is the fact that our enemies
are \l‘aging a desperate war both at the war
and home fronts, Our soldiers must be on
guard for bullets, we at the home front
cannot keep too great a vigilence for axis
lies and sabotage. It proves beyond a doubt
that sabotage, physical and mental, can and
does happen here, and tells how you, Mix

Victory Assembly issues
Resolutions Calling for
Just and Lasting Peace

Students of 30 Midwest colleges
and universities, meeting at Carle~
ton college, Northfield, Minn, as
a inidwest student Victory As-
sembly, ended their tlvocday sess—
ion Saturday by replacing full
support to America's war effort
and to the need for inter-nation
cooperation in the post-War
world. according to Feg Gardner,
Cleveland Senior, Grinnell-dele-
gate.

At their final session Satur-
day, the 135 delegates from the
represented Midwest colleges put
into resolutions their plans and
ideas formulated at four panel
discussons,

Stating that complete and final
Allied victory is the absolute
prerequisite for any future pro-
gress of all peoples, the students
went on record as endorsing all
mensunss and actions which lead
to defeat of fasmsm at home and
abroad by the establishment of
a complete war economy at home
and by the building of real mili-
tal'y and diplomatic unity among
the various United Nations.

The assembly demanded the
establishment of a United Nations
ivni- council to function now and
in the immediate postwar period,
to bring about a unity of coin-
mand, distribution of var mater-
ials. and complete coutidcucc bc-
tween the val-ions governments.

Recognizing the need for thor-
ough overvall national planning
in production and supply, mans
power supply, technical and edu-
cnhounl lllolillization, and eco~
ucmic stahalization, the assembly
delegates gnve strong support to
the Tolnu-h gore-Pepper bill now
in the House of Representatives,

Definite inessunes to alleviate
the persecution of religious and
rhcinl groups were advocath, alicl
cuc abolishincut of the poll my
was strongly recommended.

Members of the assembly con-
cluded with a resolution that this
war shall result in a just and
permanent peace. “We realize
that such a peace is only possible
when primarily based an inter»
nation cooperation, and that all
citizens o= the world should be.
come Citizens of a federal union
of nations."
