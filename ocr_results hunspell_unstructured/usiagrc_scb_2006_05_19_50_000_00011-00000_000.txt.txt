The old man were a buttoneup blue shirt and worn
our tennis shoes, He raised his arm and poinred directly
at Liliana Remeria. “Would you be willing to give up your
privilege for social justice?”

it didn't rake long for chtcria ro answer. “I tliinlti
aerually said yes very quickly, bur it was afterwards, after
the ralk, rhat I kepr thinking aboiir it,"

Rciiterra continues to explore how she can make ere
feerive sacrifices for her cause. Like many seniors, she is
deciding how to apply her classroom research to the real

world, Like many activists, she is faced
with reconciling her artcndance at a pres- LILIANA RENTERI A
tigious college with her desire to promote

social justice.

\thn Rantcria came to Grinncll shc
inrended ro complete rhe 34 engineering program but
ended up taking Intro to sociology as a respite trom her
load ofscience classes. “1r helped answer questions I’d ale
ways thought about," she said. However, Remeria’s family
had always thought college would increase her chances of
landing a wcllrpaying job. Now graduating with a 50-
ciology major, Renteria wants to work on immigration
issues, even if only unpaid posirions are available. “ 'm
determined to be part ofthis movement,”slie said,

chtcria has already involvcd other GrinnclLians in
the movement. She helped organize “On the lVlovc: the
New immigration," a symposium rhat focused on immi~
gration issues held in January. Over a hundred srudems
showed up at the different CVEHIS. “Th: fact that we had
this symposium and then the facr rlrar this thing exploded
at a national levelwas amazing,”she said,

After raising awareness of the issue, Renreria eon-
fronted immigration policy outside the safety ofacadcmia.
During a spring break trip, she visited a shrine inscribed
with the names of4.000 people who lost their lives in the
Arizona dcscrt. “I'm hch in Grinncll rind talking about
all these immigrants and this and that and acrually going
down there and seeing what thcsc deaths look likc on a
piece ofwali was very powerful," she said.

At 14, chtcriii left Mexico City and swim across the
Rio Ctandc. “Vl/hm I went to the shrine I saw that I
could have been up rhere if something had gone badly,"
she said,

After hci crossing, Renlcria enrolled at Port Isabel
High School where she discovcrcd that to cross a bol—

dcr meant crossing an ethnic boundary. “in Mexico 1
was considered white and then when I got to the United
states rbey were like, no, you've got to check the Hispanic
box, you can’t be white hcrc,"shc said, Rentcriri's father's
family is very lightsskinncd, whereas her mother’s morher
appears indigenous, “You put it all together and there are
so many ways you can construct your identity," she said.

Rentcria’s rejection of rhe Limits usually placed on the
education of immigrants rn public sehools also marked
hot as different. “I was the Mexican immigrant who's

trying to be white because i wanted an
education I had tunnel vision — that's
what I wanted," she said. During her
ﬁrst year in Texas, her teachers did not
encourage her. “My school Counselors-
wheu i came in they were li we don’t think you’re going
to make it. [At first] they didn't pur me in any AP classes.
I was actually taking an ESL class and it was so boring,”
she laughed

In contrast to her high school’s doubtful advisers and
poor ESL program, Grinnell has offered Renteria many
opportunities. Shc curfoundcd the Grinnell Multicule
rural Alliance and developed close faculry relationships.

Yer even surrounded by academic resources, Rent-
eria has difficulty determining exactly how to help ims
migrants. While waitressing with her morher ar a local
restaurant, Rentcrra encouraged the waiters and cooks to
look for betrer wages and working conditions. Though
shc corned the nickname "Social Justice Girl," she had a
difficult time causing change. “You can’t just point out
and say, ‘oh, these working conditions are terrible,’because
rhe immigrants will [be fired and] lose that money," she
said.

Renteriu’s familiarity with the realities of acrivism has
helped her maintain a halancc in her own Life. “Thcre is
this whole concept of the American Dream that if you
come here then as long as you work really hard you are
going to be able to have all this sruff,"slre said.

Remembering the old man's quesrion about privis
lege, she admitted that she sometimes succumbs to buy-
ing higheheeled boots. “I love bootsl feel tall,"she said.
Boots or no boots, chtcria’s truc height Lies in her abil-
ity to apply her experiences toward positive immigration
reform.

Actor aspires to turn blue

Normally one associates becoming bald
and playing bongos with a inidslifc crisis. Not
fol Noah Sieglcr. This is hrs dream.

“My dream job is to be in the Blue Man
Group so I have air audition in July,"hc said.

“it's a far-fetched goal brir
we’ll see how it goes. Knock
on wood rhatl make ir."

According to Siegler,
a Grinnell graduate in the
Bluc Man Group helped
him land air audirron for the troupe that toms
bincs comedy, music and mulri-media art in
their performances,

“There are people in the Blue Man Group
who know ofme already. it's not like I am just
walking in and gerring an audition," he said.
“I got a recommendation from this woman's

adviser who is my advisor too, so my chances
arc better. bill that doesn’t mean anything
There are probably a thousand people who
audition for one part. so it‘s a long shot.“

A: the audition, Sicglcr will be tested on
his acring skills and pctcus~
sion skills, As aThcatrc mas
jar with extensive involve-
ment in snitlcntsrun plays,
Siegler has been honing his
acting skills. To prepare for
the audition he has been raking percussion
skills all this scmcstcrr

Siegler’s proudesr achievcmcnr on cams
put is his contribution ro the lmprov coin-
cdy troupe. “it’s the most fun thing I do here,
which rs play improv games with the group.
we praerice every Friday and Saturday so are

tct every week ofworking in school we go and
we laugh for a couple ot'hours."

Siegler’s decision to major in Theatre was
straightforward. “It's what I like to do most.
There are very few things that will keep me
going. It's good for my sanity i can'r spend
eight hours working on political science I get
borcd and my mind wanders. For music and
theatre those are the two things that I can do
for 12 hours a day and not get tired ofil.”

1f Siegler can't join the Blue Man Group,
he still plans to pursue a career in thcatet in
New York. “i want to spend a couple ofyears
in New York seeing ifl can make it into the
atre just because 1 know in a few years ifI
haven’t done that I'll feel bad about it."

“i can't wait to get out. I love it here but
four years has been perfect for me," he said.
