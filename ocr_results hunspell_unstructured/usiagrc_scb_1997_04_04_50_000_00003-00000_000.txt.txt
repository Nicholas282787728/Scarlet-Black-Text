ference competition this week by

however, dropped the second game
of the double header 143/. They
hope to rebound on Saturday Ill an-
other doubleheader against Knox,

Coach Tim l-lollibaugh expects
his diamondinen to be well tested
in their first league encounters.
Cornell is well stocked with return-
ees and may be a surprise team in
the south division of the league.

played Knox on a nonrconfet'encc
basis. Although tlte Grinnelliaiis

While many Grinnell College
students enjoyed relaxation over
spring break, the men‘s golf squad
used the layoff from classes to
sharpen their skills. In an extended
trip to Texas the team caught plenty
of rays, but also faced some chal»
lenging courses.

”We enjoyed the Texas trip ime
mensely." noted Coach Greg
Wallace. “The weather was great,
so we played every day. Unfortu—
nately, some of the courses were
extremely difficult. There is noth—
ing wrong with playing tough
courses, but I don’t think our team
is ready for them this early in the
year."

The level ofcompetttion the Pier
neers faced at the Knox tournament
was impressive. At Knox were na~
tionally recognized squads such as
Nebraska Wesleyan, Central,
Carthage, Augustana. Knox and

Luther. “The tournament was good
for our development as a team,"
noted Coach Wallace. “When you
play against teams of that caliber,
you discover firsthand the level at
which you need to perform in order
to succeed."

Winning is “just a
matter of achieving
consistency over
the course of

several rounds”

Although the tournament was
clearly important for the team to
gauge itself, Coach Wallace ex-
pressed mixed emotions at the re

scores, which ranged from a low of
82 to a high of 85. But on the ﬂip
side those scores are just average
and not really competitive with elite
teams, As a result, Grinnell finished
10th in a lZeIeam field. “We have
people who are definitely capable
of shooting ln the 705," mentioned
Coach Wallace. “It’s just a matter
of achieving consistency over the
course of several rounds."

There are five players on
Grinnell’s golf team, and all must
perform if Grinnell hopes to chal—

at the No. 3 and No. 4 slots respeCr

those guys are solid players," noted
Coach Wallace. “We need at least
three of them to shoot in the 705 if
we want to be really competitive in
the conference. The best part is that
I know they are all capable of that."

This coming weekend will show
how much the team has improved.

games at Mount Saint Clare in
Clinton on Sunday.

Though their record in Florida
was 28, Coach Tieken was pleased
With the progress of her team during
the week. “We had to gel outdoors
to answer questions about how we
would work as a unit,” she said.

Six of the teams the Pioneers
played on break were nationally
ranked. Victories were posted over
North Adams, Mass, 3-1, behind the
pitching of freshman Jan Maxwell
and Wisconsin—Superior, 10-5, with
sophomore Megan Jones on the
mound,

“I‘m happy with the trip. I found
out that this is a group of ﬁghters.
We don’t give up in any game but
defensively we were victims of the

experience, We are starting to
come around and score some runs.
A main benefit of the spring trip
is the opportunity for players to
know each other better. The cat-
maraderie in this group is out-
standing," the coach commented,

Coach Hollibaugh cited the out-
standing play of Munoz. sopho-
more outflelder Jeff Clement and
freshman outfielder Perry Gordon.
The latter hit the ball well and also
fielded spectacularly. The top
pitching combination at this time
appears to be senior ieffVerthein
as a starter, freshman Pete Corsetti
in the middle, and Munoz as the
closer,

“I am satisfied with the
progress. The key is consistency,
We want to play good. hard. ag-
gressive baseball, The players are
starting to buy into this and I think
we can make some gains," the
coach concluded, Holltbaugh's

plenty of base runners but struggled
to get them in. This is not a power
hitting team. We have to play smart,
sharpen base ninning, and score in
other ways,” the coach remarked,
She added that the athletes came to-
gethersocially, moving toward a goal
of cohesion on and off the field.

Coach Tieken is generally satisr
fled with the performance of the iris
field so far and is pleased to have a
cot ps of five pitchers, including
Maxwell. Jones, senior Catherine
Brown, and sophomores Erin Ratjen

with a 3.06 ERA and in outﬁeld duty

Forest followed, The results of
this weekend's matches should
be interesting, conSidering
Grinnell's improvement as a
team (the Pioneers record thus far is
7-3).

The men‘s tennis trip to Florida
over spring break was a great sues
cess, and took some pressure offthe
team after a crushing loss to Luther

during the last week 0 classes.
Luther, undeniably a power in the
Iowa Conference, swept that match,
7-0. The only close matches were a

No. 3 singles and a close 7—9 loss at
No. 1 doubles by Mujl Sherdl ‘97 and
Seth Pourciau ‘00.

In Florida, however, the Pioneers

Sports Information

After training in the warm
Florida sun, the Grinnell College
women’s track team is ready to
launch its outdoor season this Sat-
urday at the Luther Invitational.
The Pioneers are coming off a
strong performance at the Midwest
Conference indoor meet where
they placed second.

This is the first time in two years
that Grinnell has run at Luther, The
meet features seven relays and will
include field events. Twelve teams
from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa
and Illinois are expected to com-
pete, “We are excited about this
meet and hope to do well," said
Coach Evelyn Freeman,

Over spring break the tracksters
got in almost two weeks of work
in Orlando, Florida, Some athletes
competed in a meet in Miami, but
since the emphasis was on training.
no scores were kept. “The weather
was great! We had excellent facili-
ties and it rained only once." com-
mented Coach Freeman.

The women’s squad also picked
up some welcome additions. New-
comers are Tina Ward ‘98. Jo
Schaalman ‘99 and Natasha Vasey
‘97 from the swim team, and Tina
Popson ‘97 and Sacha Steenhoek
‘00 from the basketball team.
Schaalman and Popson will com-
pete as middle-distance runners,
while Vasey, Ward and Steenhoek
bolster the field-event corps.

Grinnell will host the MWC out-
door championship in May andjust
like the indoor season, Monmouth
is the team to beat. “Hopefully the
momentum from the MWC indoor
meet carries us that far. We will
try to close the gap while striving
to stay ahead of Cornell and Coe,"
concluded Freeman.

Back from a great training ses-
sion in Florida, the Grinnell Cole
lege men’s track team is ready for
the Luther Invitational this Satur-
day in its first meet of the season.
Coach Will Freeman expects to
send about 30 participants to the
event. “Coming off of our train
ing trip to Florida, we are revved
up and ready to go. We expect to
see some good times this Saturn
day," commented Freeman.

With great weather to boost their
spirits, the men's track team spent
almost two weeks during spring
break in Orlando getting into shape
for the coming season. Coach
Freeman states: “I saw a lot of
progress in Orlando. and I think
that we will have a strong team this
year."

In addition to the annual
DcLong Classic on April 19.
Grinnell will also host the Midwest
Conference championships in May
this year, giving the team ample op-
portunitics to show off their talent
to a home crowd.
