Impe rsonalization

The only pro\'sion of tile llew registration procedure
which has met with opposition is tllat concerning multi-
section courses. The other pro\" ions seem IOI'Wle‘drIOOh'illg',

the Executive Council Ills made several assumptions

ceptable to stlldents in connection with this controver~
l provision.

We feel there is no reason that students should be
pel llized because some professors are jealous of the pop-
ulality enjoyed by others Some faculty members are cone
sis-:ently bypassed by registering students. It is doubtful
that the fault lies with the students.

It is probably true that equal classes would nlean im-
proved opportunities for teaching and learning, but stu-
dents woillfl rather accept crowded conditions, or wait, ill
art 2‘ to get the professors who will teach them the most.

The new procedure for multi-section courses has given
students a disillusioned View of the faculty. However, it is
dif cult to believe that the whole facility is ill favor of
this impersonalization. We hope those who are not will
make themselves heard.

Lost In Shuffle

For'nearly two year the Grinnell scene has been marli-
ed by a comforting calm. In View of this, the discontent
mi ‘Dl'ed ill this issue \l‘lll seem’ like all explosion to friends
and alumni, More to the point, it will also be unexpected
by the faculty.

\

Students are disturbed about new policies concerning
registration, the “fall weekend" combination of Homecome
' and Parents‘ Day, and a policy of expansion which ap-

‘s in the students’ eyes as a policy of crowding beyond

lble physical and academic capacity.

There are strong points in favor of each of these plans,
and doubtless they were made with the thought that they
\\'OJI(I benefit students, But, other than that vague thought,
the Executive Council formed these policies without con—
side ltion of student feelings. The students have the im—
pression that they are incidental to the whole affair.

The_Elxecutive Council is composed of nine faculty and
two administration members. It is disheartening that facuL
ty members who form policy and teach have little know-
ledge of student feeling and apparently little desire for the
knowledge.

It is obvious that the student body is only one com»
ixvent _of the college Community, and must he considered
lh relationship to the other components. However, it should
be obvious also that the parts of the College community
affected by any specific policy should be considered in its
inrmillatioil. . '
_ ' A fact for students to consider is the surplus of qualir
fleil people Wishing to get into Gl'inilcll. If any of the
1) exit students become d satisfied enough to leave, there
ulll always be plenty to fill the places. This attitude, which
has been expressed on campus, indicates that the only re-
course for students is to convince policy-makers that their
.teeJngs are right, and desel' e to be coi.idered.

NOW: Behind all this is a poly
icy of the “executive committee"
of the faculty that until now
has been unhear -of. It goes
something like . ,

Instructors are:
supposedlyequal.

That is, they are»

equal in ability,

in "audience-

appeal" in their

classes, and in their “philosophy
of grading.” So. says this com-
inittec, the student should have
no reason for wanting a certain
instructor tor a certain course.
They object to this popularity
evaluation when choosing cours-
es, and would like to urran-ve

Needless to say, this is blind
idealism at its lol‘tiesl. since
the dinerenee between instruc-
tors is recognized by the Lane
ulty as ‘a whole, and indeed
by our entire educational syse
tern. Faculty counselors advise
their serious students who are
planning to go on to graduate
school not to take certain
courses from certain professors
when they can get the same
course [mm a professor who,.
because oi his greater ability
as a teacher and scholar, can
add something to the course
other than the material in the
textbook.

An Open Letter
to the Administration:

Within the past two works,
we students have caught wind
ol many sudden and startling
Lhanges forthcoming at Grim
hell. To name a few:

ithc combining ol Home-coin
ing and Parents' day into a pig
convocation weekend;

—tlic so-callcd “answer" to
Courses with more than one SCE-
tioii and the withholding of the
names of the professors who
will touch each sectlon;

illie denial of the
enterprises such as true
mg on spring day, and:

_tiie denial or the Student
Council to handle the problems
granted to it LC, the Coca Cola-
FepsiCola dispute (the Business
omce rerused to let more ins;
chilies come on campus at all
alter the Student Council had
granted Pepsia one-month trial).

Probing into each one oi
these problems would be an
endless task, Therefore, I wish
to speak speciﬁcally about the
convocation both ironi an
alumni point oi view and the
students’ point of view. To
bring big names to c nell
is commendable. To build up
Grinnell’s reputation and to
increase its ﬁnancial intlnw is
likewise desirable.

But to do either of them
things at the expense of the
students with the addition of the
doubt as to Whether alums will
like it or not, is neither com-
mendable or desirable.

I wonder it anyone stopped
to think that when an “old
grad" comes back he will br
exporting to see a tew things
that went on when he was
here, a day with decorations
done by each hall, a ball game
that is spirited, and a dance in
the evening to top it off. But
next year when he comes for
this big convocation he will rind
a big commercial show, decora»
tions (it there are to be any)

rest of the many events. and

major doesn't want one oi these
“easy" courses. And the student
who has had a series of them
(In a language. for instance) is
lost when suddenly confronted
by an instructor whose ability
and standards at excellence are
higher.

This argument of mine admits
the existence of lionrscholastic
ideals on the sides of both stll»
olents and [acuity—a sad and a
bad situation, although not
widespread. But when the ex-
ecut 'e committee denies the
existence of an element of in-
iei-iorily among the iaculiy. and
puts the burden of this info ior-
lty on the students in an im
personal and mechanical regis—
tration system. i believe that
those of us who aren't satisﬁed
with it have a right to‘ubjeet,

To the Editor:

Coming to Grilinoll i felt
(mistakenly, i now realize) that
i could somehow escape from
a mass production education.
When my f onus spulic to me
about their registrations at the
large univcrslt’les, telling how
they were {orced into schedules
without knowledge of instruc—
turs,'i laughed, “I'm going to
Grinncll where i can choose the
men 1 am going to learn under.”
i said,

When arguing with them
last Christmas 1 always said.
“I know you have countless
courses to choose ironi, but I
am able to choose my moles

isor. I think it’s a big advan-

tage." That is one point they
always agreed with.

or course, Grinnrlrs advsii.
tages go tar beyond the area of
registration. It is fortunate they
do; tor as registration is now
being set up. Grinnall would
have no advantage over a
sprawling university.

The new system whereby the
registrar's ofhce blindly assigns
students to classes where there
is more than one section is
faster, cheaper in the long run,
and much easier for the regis-
trar’s oflice. The losers are the
members of the faculty and the
student body.

Mr. Thornton seems to believe
that the change involves only
imaginary dilriculfies for the
students; but what about the
faculty» Does not a professor
want his classes ﬁlled with stu-
dents who have chosen his class
because they like his manner
of teaching, learn wall from
him, and generally enjoy his
courses?

No matter how good an in—
structor is, there are always
students who are bored» by
his teaching style and prefer
another man, or dislike him
personally and would gladly
take any other prolessor, Why
should (Ln instructor have to
put up with such students
who would never be in his
clag or. laboratory or their
her: will? Why should he
have to contend with an un—
necessarily large number 0L
unwilling students?

Mr. Thornton also seems to
feel that since there are a very
few poor instructor at Grinnell
swhich is so trucilt will make
no actual dinerence which prm
fessor a student is forced to
take. But it is ridiculous to use
sume that some instructors are
not better than others; it is
also obvious, even to me, that
some instructors in the same
courses are more vigorous and
thorough than others. This is
a simple (act, ‘

Theoretically. why should a
premed biology major, desiring
the mosi complete background
possible. be cheated out of the
most thorough and rigorous
professor in the natural science
