Not until Wednesday afternoon
ivasthc ﬁrst tootball practice ot
the season seen on the Grinncll
gridiron. Truly a late time to be-
gin when nearly everyone of our-
opponents have been out tor a
week and over, The large num-
ber of vacancies to be ﬁlled on
the Varsity brought out a goodly
array of candidates: sixteen the
ﬁrst night, twentyrseven the secs
end by actual count. Many of
the men are new material and
necessarily an unknown quantity.
The interest and zeal of the can-
didates to work for places on the
team, is ot course pleasing to the
eye and encouraging to the man-
agement. But the one indispuh
able fact that stares Grinnell in
the face is, that a vast amount of
work must be (lone to get the
team in condition. The ﬁrst game
isjiist two weeks distant. can a
team be organized in that length
of time?

This is the problem ivhich Cons
fronts the management. “Jack”
was on hand the ﬁrst day to get
the men in condition. His ser
vices in past years are well known
to all triendsot thccollege. Grins
nell never put torth a ﬁner cons
clitioned team than that of last
year. Heivillovcrlooktlie physio
al weltare of the team during this
season, and, we are sure, wlth the
same success. C. E. Harris has
served in the capacity of coach
during former years. His enthusir
asm and energy in the work of
coaching is inexhaustible, and his
greatest success lies in imparting
those same qualities to his team.
Moreover, he is an alumnus and
has the real interest of the college
at heart, He deserves the entire
conﬁdence and cooperation of
the team and will certainly receive

 

it. Coach Harris will arrivein a
few days, and in the meantime as-
sistant coaches will have the men
in charge. During these ﬁrst few
days, of course, only light work is
taken.
ing, and a little signal practice are
all that have been required. It is
too early to make predictions, and
no satisfactory estimate can be
made. As was previously stated,
the number of candidates is en-
couraging,and, but let the present
enthusiasm and interest continue,
Grinnell may have hopes or get.
ting together a fairly creditable

team.

Track Team.

At the beginning of every school
year it becomes necessary to look
ahead at our chances tor winning
the spring meets. One way we
look ahead isto take advantage ot
the ﬁrst six weeks of school in the
fall and secure preliminary trains
ing tor the Fall Handicap Field
Meet This meet is tor the Fur»
pose of giving new men a chance
to show of what they are capable.
The men are all given good and
reasonable handicaps, m a kin g
every event close. Another rea-
son tor the tall meet is that while
Iowa City, Drake and Antes have
so many men to pick from in the
spring, we must make our choice
from about onerthtrd the number;

and we being so small, makes it a
necessity for us to get together
early in the year and then to pull
together for the rest of the year.
So therefore, let every man who
has ever done anything on the
track or who even wishes to. come
out at 4:15 every afternoon in suit
and shoes, ready tor business.
There are a good many vacancies
this year and new material will
have the best chance imaginable.
Tile track is in poor shape. but by
Monday or Tuesday it will be all
right and when scraped it makes
one of the fastest quarterrmile
tracks in Iowa.
