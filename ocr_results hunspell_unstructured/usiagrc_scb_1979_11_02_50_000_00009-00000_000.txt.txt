Da has begun its second year on
Broadway When it first opened, the
play received rave reViews. The New
York Times wrote, “In a class with
the best of Sean O'Caséy, it is steeped
in Irish language, laughter, and at-

return to Iowa for the touring cast
which a iew weeks ago played in Iowa
City, Ames, and Des Moines, where it

phlets with lists of dance, music, and
theatre groups who are available for
tours. The committee then sits down
with pamphlets and gets a list of
pass ties for the following year.

mances. If We had a classical dance
company last year we'll try to get a
modern dance group next time," said
Dobbs.

The committee also applies for
grants from the Affiliated State Arts
Agencies of the Upper Midwest. the
