Dear Editor,

Trees and other vegetation in a land»
scape setting require maintenance — to
maintain their health and Vigor, and to
assure mat they serve the purpose tor
which they are placed, e.g., shade
(seasonal or not), shelter from our prevail-
ing north-westerly winds, cosmetic screen-
ing of less pleasant vistas, aesthetics
and/or focal points of interest. etc. To my
mind, we do well with our (few) flower
beds and with the lawns, less well with the
shrubs and foundation plantings, and poor
ly with the trees, As a function of available
time, manpower and equipment (all of
which translate to budget), the little tree
maintenance that normally gets done is
accomplished in small spurts during the
spring and summer when our grounds
crew is very involved maintaining athletic
facilities, mowing lawns, and attending to
myriad other logistical chores assorted
with commencement, reunions, alumni
days, summer programs, etc. With the
phenomenal open spring-like winter that
we’ve enjoyed mis year, however, it has
been possible to address the much
neglected tree maintenance problem (no
snow to plow, walks to clear, sand to
spread, etc.). What appears like a
vigorous flurry of cutting and pruning is in
fact a continuation of what is usually a
much less conspicuous, and less effective,
summer maintenance program.

Some of the purposes served by pruning
and cutting are:

, ii To remove dead and dying branches,
and snags, which can serve as entrance
courts for decay organisms. When it’s
feasible, and we think its safe, we do keep
occasional hollow trees as nest sites for
squirrels, birds and other wildlife. We
have also replaced several oi our recent
storm losses witrl hickory, walnut and but

2) To reduce the number of weak, .e.,

wind damage late in the life of a tree.

growth, is addressing the appearance of

4) To preclude injury to people and
damage to property from falling trees
and/or limbs.

5) To provide for the light and air cir»
culation needs of grass, forbs and shrubs
growing beneath the tree, or of other near-
by trees.

6) To facilitate grounds maintenance
and enhance the safety of maintenance
personnel. The most serious longrterm
damage to to our trees and shrubs
originates with ground-level abrasions
from lawn mowers and other machinery,
An operator who doesn’t have to dodge and
fend off low-sweeping branches is much
less likely to scuff a tree. Some well-
shaped conifers, of course, are maintained
as specimen trees with branches down to
the ground In this connection, we are ex
perimenting with several differentways to
minimize the scuffing problem: a) plastic
tree-wraps on saplings; b) mulching
around young trees to keep the grass away
from them (most mulches, however, cause
troubles for reel-type mowers); cl
chemical
zones around tree bases to eliminate the
temptation to mow too'close, and d) the
use of iron stakes to mark and protect
whip-size trees. — Ben Graham, Professor

SGA officercriticizes VP. election

Dear Editor:

I want to apologize to the students of
Grinnell. It came to my attention, after the
ballots were counted last Friday, that
some of ﬁle Election Board members who
worked the Vice Presidential election were
showing preference and campaigning for a
candidate while handing out the ballots.
This was not how I intended the election to
be run. it you were subject to this bias
while voting. [am very sorry.

I am at fault in that I did not say to those
who‘worked that this behavior was strictly
prohibited. I felt it was obvious that the
person who sits behind the table and hands
out the ballots should in no way show a
preference~obviously not. i also received
complaints that students were uncomfor»
table while voting due to the presence of
one of the candidates. Thae events should
immediately invalidate the election.
However, due to the nature and timing of
this election, I left the decision to the can-
didates and they chose not to contest the
election.

1 have written up election procedures to
be approved by Election Board and Joint
Board. These guidelines outline for
everyone what I mistakingly felt was ob,
vious, and they will be used in the upcom-
ing Presidential and Vice Prsidential
elections, Those people about whom I
received complaints are no longer on Elecr
tion Board,

1 do not wish to imply that Shannon un»
fairly won the election, 1 am only saying
that the election was uniairly run. The
margin of votes indicates that Shannon
would have won in any situation, and she
will be a very good Vice President.

Yes, Grinnell College is a casual, laid
back kind of place, but i do not think that is
an excuse for unfair elections. My
apologies to the students and candidates.
If anyone is unhappy with any aspect or
future elections at Grinnell. please talk to
the Election Board Chair as soon after the
occurance as possibleiAnnette N.

Student finds alternative to poverty

Dear Editor:

Now the symposium on homelessness is
over and the students seem to have been
deserted, It was arranged that a number of
speakers would come to our campus and
raise our consciousnesses. Now here we sit
with our raised conscmusnesses, so aware
of society’s wrongs and ieeling helpless to
do anything about it, Our two alternatives
seem to be intellectualizing in ‘deep' con-
versations with our peers about our place
in such an unjust society, or taking Mitch
Snyder’s advice and dropping out.

Actually, there is at least one more alter-
native; there are more it only students
would look for them. While Mitch Snyder
was Speaking, he mentioned a shelter in
Des Moines which was being closed by the
city. One student in the audience was not
only touched by Snyder's speech, he was

prompted to take action. Dave Lowenstein
called to Des Moines and found out enough
information about the situation that he felt
compelled to inform the student body ot
the problems facing Kindred House at a
meeting Wednesday in the Forum.

Hopelully, by the time this issue is
published, a great many students will be
putting various skills and abilities to a
useful purpose: helping to keep Kindred
House going. How long this help will last is
unknown. Hopefully, once the word‘
‘homeless’ brings a Specific face to mind,
students will find lt much more difficult to
rationalize their way out of feelings
brought on by the symposium. it there is
anyone who is interested in helping out in
any way, feel free to call Dave at 23675916
or myseli, Kelly, at xl799.—Kelly Camp»

Students qualify Snyder’s message

Dear Editors:

in response to the editorial concerning
the feeling evoked by the Mitch Snyder
speech, we would like to establish that not
all Grinnellians were applauding their
guilt. Some were applauding Mitch for his
courage and his example and for his
revelation of a long searched for solution
to those who really want to do something.
As tor the converts-they are not entirely
motivated by guilt. Part of his objective
was to create that feeling, but it was also to
get beyond the’guilt and to take action.
Maybe not everyone in that room will be a
“convert”, but if at least one is, then he
has accomplished his goal. The guilt may
be a useless emotion, but it can be over-
come and once this occurs, great things
can be accomplished. Some people who
have been very comfortable with their
white, middleclass liberalism may feel a
few pangs of guilt that they have not felt
beiore. Some may even begin to question
their own righteous attitudes.

Mitch’s speech. which should have been
mandantory, not only for the students, but
also for the faculty and administration (in-
cluding the trustees), was an incredible
account of the evils some members of
society can justify inﬂicting upon others.
We, the elite of Grinnell, have to take a
step back from our righteousness and ads
mit that the majority of us do not do a
damn thing to alleviate the problem. With

Ali

mg to town, and that can only mean one
thing: Tuition is going up. There, it’s out.
start warning your parents, because they
will soon be getting that dreaded letter
from President Drake. Maybe advance
warning will ease the shock. of course, it
really shouldn't be a shock. l‘ve been told
that tuition at Grinnell (and most other
schools) has been raised eighteen years in
a row. Why should this year be any dif-
ferent’! Indeed, the real question is, by how
much will tuition increase? I coniess there
is not much SGA can do to inﬂuence the
tuition-increase decision. About all I can
do and have done is ask that more

few exceptions, we continue, by our ex-
ploitation of our capitalist system to
perpetuate the poverty and homelessness.

We are not proposing that everyone do
what Mitch does, but that people accept
that his approach is the ONLY way to rid
our society of the capitalist system. in lecr
tures following Mitch's talk, Robert Hayes
argued that there should be people in
mainstream institutions who attempt to
correct the problem. But unless a large
number oi people realize the inherent evils
ln our society, all the attempts at putting a
band-aid on a festering open Wound aren’t
enough.

We, like many others who came here in
search of a solution, are also perpetuating
the system and all is evils, so as we cone
demn the system, we include ourselves. It
is this system that locks us into our current
position. We came here hoping to find a
solution to many problems, but In doing so
we have incurred large debLs to our
government, as Mitch admitted, In order
to break away, many of us will first have to
work to first repay our loans. So, even as
we perpetuate the system , we are also vice
tims of it. That does not mean that we can
forget about our positnn in society that
leaves the questions of poverty and
homelessness up to us. As soon as we see
an opportunity to abandon this system, we
will take it.--Thank you, Kris Leonard,
Peggy Doyle

The SGA Office is staffed every
weekday afternoon, even Friday, trom 15
PM with people who are willing, and
depending on their academic load,
sometimes even eager to help. So if you
have an idea or concern you need help
with, please come and see us. If you don’t,
we get lonely. It‘s not easy being patient
all the time.
