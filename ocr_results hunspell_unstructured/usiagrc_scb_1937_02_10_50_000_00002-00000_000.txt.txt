Meyers Explains Causes
of Short Circuits
in Power Lines

“Wish I had a date!” said halt
the population at the Libc when
the lights went out for the third
time Monday night. And it wasn't
just the library; electricity was off
and on, all over town Monday and
Tuesday.

The students who blamed fail-
ing eyesight, and the ones who
cursed the college lighting system
were all wrong. The flickering was
caused by the sleetvstomi which
covered central Iowa, according to
Paul P. Meyers, college mainte-
nance superintendent and general
manager of the Iowa Southern
Utilities company in Grinnell.

Ice on Wires

"Ice termed on the transmission
wires in the country," he said,
“and then a high wind rose." It
swung the wires into synchroniza-
tion and made them “jump" as
much as eight to ten feet. when-
ever two struck together, a short-
circuit was made. and the current
went or: temporarily.

Grinnell’s current comes from a
general system which connects
Des Moines, ottumwa, Center»
ville, Oskaloosa, and several small-
er towns, Mr. Meyers explained
yesterday The Iowa Southern
Utilities also has a plant here, not
usually operated, which was put
into service Monday. It is being
kept in readiness to help bear the
load again it an expected blizzard
materializes.

Burn Candles

Candles burned throughout the
college and tovrn Monday night, es-
pecially in the college library.
Nancy Griffin and Jeanne MCEI-
ravy were torehanded enough to
take their own candles. once Miss
Miriam Allen, assistant librarian,
had to light Prof. and Mrs. Joseph
Charlton to the front door with a

candle.

League board members and
quadrangle hostesses grew greys
haired when lights were out in the
cottage parlors and the recreation
room. Studying was generally for-
gotten as students preferred un-
prepared recitations to headaches
caused by studying by candle
light.

Asked if anything exciting Ill-1pc
pened when the lights went cit, a
Waitress in a popular eating-place
replied, “No. They came on too
often and too suddenly."

“There Will probably be no more
trouble with the lights," Mr. Mey—
ers declared. “that is, unless that
blizzard comes along.
