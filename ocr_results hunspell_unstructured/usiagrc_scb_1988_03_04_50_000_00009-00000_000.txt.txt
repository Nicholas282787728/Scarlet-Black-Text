91/2 Weeks

by Brian Strause

“eta Weeks" was brought to us
by the same teenyrbopperrplcasing
director. Adrian Lyne, who scored
big with the titillating
“Flashdance " it that does not
give you reason enough to pass up
this seltrindulgent music video
from hell, then take into account
that the clerks at AdventureLand
Video highly recommend “eta
Weeks” as being “a great movie.”
In the past, had I taken their ad»
vice, I would have enjoyed a lively
evening of “The’Corntield Killer"
iollowed by “Porky's II."
Somehow. I resisted. but then
again, what do you expect irom a
store that puts "The African
Queen" and “Terms of Endearr
ment" in the budget bin'.’

“an Weeks" has everything that
a good pre-pubescent thriller
should have, The manly Mickey
Rourke plus the sensuous sex pup~
py Kim Basinger plus wild,
creative sex games equals a iilm
whose scenes can be relived over
and over again in all their throbb-
ing glory. Uniortunately, “9hr
Weeks" is rated ”R" so the
youngsters who really need this
kind oi outlet were probably turned
away irom the theatre.

John (Mickey Rourke) sees
Elizabeth (Kim Basingerl at a
Chinese market. Their eyes meet
Oh, baby, baby, baby, and there's
iire in those eyes, burning to a beat
oi gyrating passion 0h, honey, it’s
like I've known you all my life,

For some reason or another.
they don‘t exactly meet. But there
will be other days at the market.

.Sure enough. the two hook up, And

this time they exchange a honey-
you-canrsizzle-me-on-yourrtrying»
pan-any~dayroi'rthe»week stare,
And that‘s what happens tor the
rest oi the iilm.

Was it sheer passion that
brought the seemingly ordinary
John and Elizabeth together? Or
was it the pulsating, aphrodisia a1
beat 01 the soundtrack? Maybe it's
a mixture oi the two. But, ii We
were to make a pie graph, the
soundtrack would win hands down.
“9“,; Weeks" iS a music Video,
possessing all the charms oi that
genre 7 it‘s slick, boring, and cons
ducive to headaches

As ior the good si one cannot
deny the acting ab ty that went
into this iilm. Mickey Rourke
reportedly got so wrapped up in
playing the part oi John that he
acted the part even when he was
oii-camera. This technique is also
used by Meryl Streep. Apparently.
Kim Basinger liked being treated
like a twtrbit whore, so it all work
ed out very well.

The New York Times called “9'2
Weeks" “one woman's vacuous
journey to the outer reaches other
sexuality and the man who takes
her there.” The key word in that
sentence is ”vacuous " There’s
nothing here, “an Weeks" is void
and hollow. ii a Iilm could echo, it
would.

The Tree of Wooden Clogs

by Leii Larson

Every exquisite irame of Er»
manno Olmi’s “The Tree oi
Wooden Clogs" is drawn from the
iecund, umber soil of its setting.
olmi's portrayal oi the commune
oi Bergamo, northeast of Milan,
exists in a realm far distant from
that of “cinema"; it derives its
visual splendor, smoothrslow
rhythms, and organic unity irom
the strength of an implicit faith in
God, man, and nature. It does not
teach, show, and dramatize so
much as it germinates, ierments,
and permeates.

in “The Tree oi Wooden Clogs."
Olm‘i's palette is one oi natural
light — the sun and the seasons,
candlelight, a kerosene lamp. With
this palette he paints the life or live
families that live on a farming
commune and share a ramshackle
Iarmstead with each other and
their treasured animals, Amateur
actors irom the region provide
honest, unmannered perior-
mances. The course oi the iilm is
the course or the seasons, and
nature's cycles provide the rhythm
and movement oi the film, olmi re-
jects tricks oi iraming, editing,
and contrived suspense His direc~
tion is sure: scenes are structured
in “real time.” irames are deiined
by the earth and natural limits, the
peasants' lives are celebrated in
the ordinary rather than the ex-
traordinary. 0lmi nearly
transcends the medium and
transports the viewer to this world
instead oi telling its tale; in doing
so he approaches the grail oi the
“slice of life.”

Film remains a creative pro
cess, however, and Olmi's
presence is ielt in a number oi
ways, as is inevitable when one
man writes. directs, and edits a
Iilm. Implicit in the film is the con-
ilict oi the natural and the impos-
ed. The spiritual, human, and
organic is venerated while the
political, economic, and legal
criticized, The opening montage
that flashes on the screen shows
the landlord taking two-thirds of
the peasants' crop as rental ior the
land. Thus. even as we absorb the
wonder oi existence in the iilm, we
labor under the knowledge oi this
oppression and exploitation. The
presence oi the church is also om»
nipresent: church bells periodical
ly sound. prayers are said ior
relatives, meals, and cattle.
Crosses and rosaries are always
hear at hand; even the exchange of
greetings assumes a prayerllke
quality,

“The Tree of Wooden-

Clogs" is a triumph oi cinema even
as it avoids being cinema. It lives
as iilins rarely do

Meet Me
in St.Louis

by John Newmark

1904 was a big year ior the
Midwest, especially St. Louis. That
was the year the World's Fair was
held there. imagine you are a
teenage girl living in St, Louis at
that time. A year beiore the iair
opens, your father gets an oiier ior
a job thousands oi miles away and
decides to accept.

You and the rest oi your iamily
will have to move beiore the iair
opens. You will miss a once-in-a-
liietime event. That is the problem
that [aces Esther Smith tJudy
Garland) in the musical, “Meet Me
in St. Louis "

The musical was released in 1944
at a time when many American
iamilies were breaking apart
because oi the war, The unity oi
the Smith iamily made the iilm
quite popular at that time.
However, the themes brought out
in the musical are still quite rele-
vant. It is interesting to see a tannin
1y at the turn or the century having
the same problems that we do,
chr so years later

Not only do thethemes make the
musical a pleasure to watch, but
the creative directing by Vincent
Minnelli adds even more to the
rum. Whenever I watch the movie,
both the title song and the Trolley
Song, as well as the scene on Hallo-
ween Night, reluse-to leave my
memory [or hours alter the iilm is
over. But perhaps the one scene
that stays in my mind the longest is
the one at the end with the
snowmen

There are three reasons why I
recommend this musical, First.
Jud Garland has a remarkably
enc anting singing voice. Second.
Vincent Minnelli's direction is
quite unique and leaves the viewer
with a lasting positive impression.
Third, the music. plot, and themes
combine with the superb acting
and direction to create a wonderiul
evening. on a rating scale oi iive
stars, “Meet Me in St. Louis"
ranks a o u a «tr.

Queen Anne
in Grinnell

by Vincent Prosser

The house reproduced above
stands at 1222 Broad Street and is
the home at Professor and Mrs,
Parslow. What really interested
me about the architecture of the
house. made me Want to write
about it. is its similarity to a house
in Margaret Keyes' book
"Nineteenth-Century Home Arr
chitecture oi Iowa City." The
house, illustrated on page 103 oi
her excellent work, is no longer
extant. but is similartoanother
Iowa City Summit Street house
which still stands, at the corner of
Summit Street and Burlington
Avenue. one block away irom the
“Bloom County" house.

Keyes classiiies houses such as
the Parslow house as “Neo-
Jacobean."My impression is that
She uses this term because it does
not necessarily imply turrets or
woodrtrame construction to the ex-
tent that "Queen Anne" does, This
allows her to group together
houses teven including the Bloom
County house) which are united in
their overarching use oi such ar-
chilectural details as tishrscale
siding. banding (a sort of pseudo
halirtimbcringi. and extra porches
or balconies scattered on the upper
stories.

The Parslbw house shares these
[eatures, but also includes such
relatively unique ieatures as the
window panes in the tower which
[allow the curve of the wall The
house, built in 1903, is quite late
Queen Anne and very simpliiied in
style. The classiclzed detailing of
the porch is perhaps indicative oi
the influence of early 20th-century
Colonial Revival. Built by a local
dentist ior his iamily, the house
went through many owners until
the Parslows moved in in 1963.
Luckily. although the house had
been used as three separate stu-
dent apartments, no mayor struc-
tural changes had been made.

The house is oi very solid cone
