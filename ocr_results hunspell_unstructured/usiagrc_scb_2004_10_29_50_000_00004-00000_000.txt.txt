The program is born from a gift to rho collcgc of
the Iowa Peace Institutes headquarters building and
endowment, which is currently worth approximately
$650,000. The institute was founded as a nonprofit
corporation in 1986 and recognized by the Iowa Leg-
islature to “promote alternatives to the violent resolu-
tion of conflict,"lt was brieﬂy located in Des Moincs

In 2003, the Peace Institute “began looking for a
way to continue its mission in a more ﬁnancially sta

a small budget and formed a committee that would
decide how to constnicr the program, As Verrer put it,
the gift was one “without strings attached.”

The program will continue to support and coor-
dinate mediation services for Poweshiek County and
truancy intervention services for local schools. “The
[county] magistrate is Very supportive of [the medias
tion] program," said Vettcr. “All small claims cases in
Poweshiek County, or almost all ofthcm, are required
to go to mediation first... About 70 percent are res
solved in mediation and those that aren't then go to
hearing, but the idea is to help people resolve their
problems without having to go to court." The media-

In conjunction with the peace pole dedication
ceremony, the committee brought several speakers
to campus between Oct, 8 and 12, three of whom
spoke on the Israeli»Palcstlnlan conflict. Although
the speakers included a former special adviser to the

Organization (PLO) Commissioner for Jerusalem

The Peace Studies Program receives assistance in
organizing lccturcs from the Rosenfield Program in
Public Affairs, International Relations and Human
Rights and from the Center for International Studies,
said Vetter,

The Peace Studies Program will also facilitate and
sponsor student internships. Internships could be rai-
lorcd to student intercst,but possiblc internships may
be with organizations that bring Israeli and Palestinc
ian musicians together or that fosrcr restorative justice

In order to raise awareness of peace issues, the
Peace Studies Committee also identified parts of this
year’s curriculum that deal With conflict and conflict
resolution. All of the peace studies-related courses
chosen by the committee are listed on the Peace Stud»
les Program’s weopage, except for one now coursc that
will be taught next semester in the Japanese depart
ment, in English, called “I survived: Japanese Comics
and War."

When asked whether, with the combination of
curriculum and internships, the Peace Studies Pro-
gram could be turned into a formal concentration,
Vetter repl'tcd, “We‘re not there yet, We’re growing
gradually and it would bc something that we would
dcﬁnitcly consider...as we become more established
or are perhaps able to encourage more curricular inc
corporation of peace studies."

At the peace pole dedication ceremony, Profesr
sor Bob Grey, Political Science, reminisced about
Grinnell’s legacy of nonviolent political and social
activism. For example, Grinnell students protesting
the Vietnam War by occupying the campus Reserve
Ofﬁcer Training corps (ROTC) house accidentally
broke a window and immediately took up a collection
to pay for its repair.

To Grey, a legacy of such activism will make

0n faculty diversity: ”As PAA, 1 will
ensure that we bring in new faculty to
every department through the [Minors
ity Scholar in Residence] Program, We
will fund this by having an alumni
fund drive for endowed chairs. If
alums will pay for the extravaganza of
new buildings going up around cam-
pus, they will certainly put forward
the smaller amount of money needed
to create excellent and diverse faculty
on this campus.”
Experience: ”Last March, Andy Grimm
and Iran against each other for the
SGA VP/PAA position, It was a very
close race, but in the end, he came

out on top with a narrow margin of
nineteen votes.... While in saddened
that events have forced Andy Grimm
to take a leave of absence, and I hope
for his future success, I am deeply
concerned about what he leaves her
hind."

0n tuition: ”I will fight against raisr
irig tuition merely to ’keep pace with
out peer institutions: I am also very
opposed to the turrcnt ﬁnancial aid
policy that interprets the ’full-need’
goal we supposedly hold so dear to
mean, ’Bleed every student for every
penny they can possible afford',.,l
will always be at the forefront of an
effort to increase ﬁnancial aid beyond
the bare minimum."

On Working with trustees and
administrators: "I will never back
down nor shall I ever fail to champion
student demands. I will reopen the
line of communication between the
student body and the administration
Never again should we allow things
such as the Forum Grill or the South-
em Express to change or close without

Priorities if elected (academic):

- Buffer/Reading Days before ﬁnals
week

- Larger, more diverse faculty

- Online Registration

Priorities if elected (student life):

- Campus safety

- Tuition

- Parking

~ Cored dorm rooms

on faculty diversity: "In my opinion,

Students are not able to have a true

liberal arts education if they are not

exposed to different opinions on any

issue. i will push for the continuation

of [the faculty Diversity Initiative}

as well as more programs like it in

order to create a much more ethni-

cally, ideologically, and pedagogically

diverse faculty."

on audcu- “This year’s renewed use

of the Judicial Council, in which stu-

dents, instead of administrators decide

the fate of their peers, represents a

return to our basic philosophy of self

governance. However, 1 also ﬁrmly be

lieve that the ssh VicerPresident has a

responsibility to ensure that the cases

brought before JudCo are indeed seri-

ous infractions of self-governance.”
0n self-governance: "We need to re
establish our commitment to assuring
its continuation. speciﬁcally through
a renewed emphasis on educating
students."

Experience: "I was a Joint Board Sen-
ator for two semesters, have served
on several committees... and am cur-
rently the President of the Student
Alumni Association."

an lutition: "If elected ViterPresir
dent, i will fight against these
increases in tuition that exceed the
rate of inﬂation. 1 will also work to
see that financial aid continues to

rise and that Grinnell’s program of
loan forgiveness is increased so that
students are not graduating with such
large amounts of debt.”

on working with administrators/
trustees: ”I already have established
a good relationship with many admins
istrators of the college, as well as with
the Board of Trustees... Iwill continue
to take a strong stand and see to it
that students and administrators work
together to make positive changes."
