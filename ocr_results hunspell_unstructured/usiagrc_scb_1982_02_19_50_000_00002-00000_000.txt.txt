in addition to changes caused by

plans revisions in housing options. The
new proposal includes distributing single-
s'ex floors among several dorms rather
than designating dorms as only single-sex
by alternating noors. Another section of
the proposal calls for lower nun-Co-op pron

Although room configurations tor Loose

several features. St dents will find addi-
tional lounges adjoining the kitchenettcs
on each floor and expanded laundry

ment was also enlarged. Space ior these
improvements came by reducing storage
areas which were empty or poorly utilized.
In addition, the basement lounge was mov»
ed from the west to the east side of the
hallway to insure better ventilation

Krause attributed the decision to increase

Besides the room improvements Krause
also mentioned other structural changes
slated for Cowles. He noted the college
plans to put in double doors on the south
entrace tn the building. equip the dining
hall with air-conditioning and resurface
the balcony root.

"They [the collegel knew they couldn‘t
keep students on the balcony so they
decided to put on a new urt ace to help stop

Krause noted the new surface "is not fund

. lt's tunny that only a "knowing" glance
or a snide remark can intensify an inac-
curate stereotype of the gay community at
Grinnell. Just recently. I asked a friend at

overheard my question and responded
with a chorus oi derogatory comments

I‘ve seen similar reactions to a mention
at the college‘s gay community before and
have often been curious as to where the
negative attitudes stemmed from. Like
most curious students. I had never taken
the initiative to attend one of the group:
meetings tor [ear of being labeled “gay"
by members of our college community.

However. last Week my editor called
with an assignment Go and talk to Bob

. Dorsett about GCG , he said. "See what
plans they have tor this semester. Also,
check out why they might not get any more
money from IFC to fund events."

Present were Dorsett and Donna Kelley.

Lesbian/Feminist Group lL/FG). respecn
tlvely. along with some members of both
groups who declined to have their names
revealed.

Initial discussion revolved around the
question of how many students " clong" to
the two groups. An exact number is hard to
decide because there are always new laces
showing up at the two groups' weekly
meetings. In terms of "participatory
members" ti e those who work at organiz-
ing eventsl. Dorsett altered a ligure at
about 40‘for GCGC. It was also clarified
mat some students participate within both
groups.

When asked why there were two distinct
groups instead or one all-encompasing
organization, Kelley said, "Well, obvious-
ly. women are ditterent than men. They
have different needs, they face different
problems, etc. We need a comfortable
place where women can be together to talk
about each other.“

Although the two groups are distinct,
they do work together “There is always
discussion of the national gay situation at
the meetings," explained Dorselt. It‘s
very easy to lose touch ata placelike Grin

This makes up the "business“ part of
meetings. What I found interesting was the
discussion of their personal situations in
life The entire "gay issue" has received
mass public attention recently. it is a
serious deviation from the norm in the
eyes or much oi society. Homosexuals
often wonder about their sell'rimage and
how their sexual decisions are going to air
fect their lives in a vast nonvunderstanding
society. There is contusion with respect to
future interaction with peers of both sexes
and confusion about how their preferences
will affect their lifestyles.

~~ ’Coming out' is a very big step."
related one of the persons present I asked
him it he had opened up to his parents.
”Uh. yeah , , i haven't spoken to my
mother in two years,“

“That‘s one thing," said one woman
"Our parents come from a society with a
totally different set of values than we do, It
would be very hard for them to understand
and accept what we're doing, I‘m not going
to tell my parents. . i love them too much
to jeopardize our relationship."

Members at both sexes humorously
reflected on how "straights" sometimes
feel awkward around gay or bisexual pear
ple in social settings. "Guys think that this
‘dyke' is trying to make moves on their
girlfriend and the same thing is true for
gay guys. Sometimes it is so lrustratiiig
the way some people think of us as sex
crazy sterotypical perverts!"

There has been suggestion that GCGC

receive no further funding from SGA for
their projects or that they receive funr
ding and match the allocations with their
own money. This creates a kind of CatchnZZ
situation. since GCGC has no budget

"Some people probably think that
because GCGC is such an active group.“
Said Dorselt. "IFC tInitizttive Fund Com- 7
mitteel should try to prevent us from
becoming too visible on campus. They
think of us as being a small. speCialn
interest group whose activities wouldn't
benctit a lot or people. But look at what
we've been doing . the Ginni Clemmens
concert was packed for both shows; the
dance we just had was a big success 1
mean. I don't think there‘s a questions as
to whether or not GCGC has initiative."

The question might be one of how much
money one group should get. Since GCGC
has been a very active group on campus.
they have been given a large portion oi
IFC funds. However, it is not the case that
other groups have applied and been turned
down in favor of GCGC. Dorsett, a
member of IFC, said that he would undersn
tand the decision it mere were other
groups waiting to get money for their ac-
tivities

greater awareness or the gay and lesbian
