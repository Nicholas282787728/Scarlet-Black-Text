played off Thursday alter-noon at
Ward tield, when the advanced sopho-
mores deteated beginning sophomores
ii and upperclassnien took a 10—1
victory train the postman sound. The
ireshniau-uppei-class tilt ““5 more
closely contested than the sophomore
battle in which the beginners offered
little competition to their more an
perienced opponents. .

A icw players on each team
made the contests interesting by ex-

iting a fast and levelrlleadcd
brand or real hockey, but on the
whole the playing was characterized
by more rootwoi-k than headwor
and there was a marked tendency to
play eleven positions instead of one.
Several or the upperelass players did
not exhibit the brand or play expecte
ed from their ability and experience.

The play on Ward field gave the
,women a taste of real hockey er
pei-ience which is hard to get on a
small practice field, and it is expect»
ed that they will turn Thursdays ex-
‘perience to proiitnhle use in the tinal
games next week.
