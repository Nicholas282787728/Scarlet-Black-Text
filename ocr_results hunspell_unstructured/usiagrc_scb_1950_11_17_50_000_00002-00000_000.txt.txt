Paradox or Progrees«

An edict has been issued by the administration It is
this: No faculty member may invite couples to babysit
in their homes.

We dislike the order. But far more than this particu-
lar statement, we object to the principles whicll seem to
stand behind it.

A college, in order to keep its name relatively unblem-
ished, may do its utmost to protect its students. It can
make a great many rules which are designed to hold its
students in check. 0r its administration may be founded
upon a different principle—building the character of its
students through allowing them to make decisions thenr
selves instead of legislating for them.

The Grinnell college catalog for 1950 states, “Phrases
like ‘a laboratory in democratic living‘ and ‘a preparation
for adult citizenship’ sometimes become altogether too fa-
miliar. Grinnell college tries to put real meaning into such
phrases . . . " Do such strongly worded “Thou shalt nots”
astl'llave been handed down to us since last spring bear this
On l

Rules forced upon any community too often, if they
aren’t mutually developed between the governed and govA
erning, produce the unhealthy situation of an outer cone
formity masking an unwilling inner dissent. Is this not
a form of hypocrisy?

Are the makers of these rules, who are striving to do
their best for this institution, willing to bear the responsi-
bility for breeding hypocrisy?

Rules are made to protect the small number of people
in any community too weak to protect themselves. The
rule for the minority acts as restriction on the majority.
However, if we’re going to do a thorough job of this would
it not be a much better idea to lock up ARH and the chapel
every time they are unused? Shouldn’t we forbid any so-
cial dancing and put on a rule against any male having
anything to do with any female on the campus? And
hadn’t we better dig up every tree and bush in the near
vicinity?

In the sincere, searching, speeches of Nels Ferre this
week, he stated, “Any moral standard is relative only to
the society that lays it down." We are wondering if the
moral codes laid down to this community have been con-
structed with the inevitable reaction in mind. Following
the aim quoted from the catalog, we wonder if it wouldn’t
be in accord with this high principle to allow those who are
being governed to share in devising the government.

In the particular question of babysitting this would
include faculty and students affected. This actually is
working toward a reasonable compromise,

Or other plans of compromise may be thrown out for
consideration. Why not consider the possibilities of a list
of couples approved to babysit? They might be engaged
couples only; they might be people with parents’ pel'mlSA
sion; they might be couples chosen with the careful disc
cretion of th faculty. There are no doubt other ways to
handle the situation.

A hardship is worked on faculty members who will no
longer be able to take advantage of the times when one or
the other of a couple can arrive earlier than the other ln
order to take care of children the whole time they are gone.
Students, under this rule, cannot have dates and study at
the same time. Which is more likely to suffer, dating or
studying? Sunday evening dinners in'l'aculty homes pre-
pared by the babysitters would be a thing of the‘ past.

The couples who babysit would undoubtedly be allowed
to sit in living rooms at home without parental chaperon
age. These same people are probably not restrained lrom gor
ing out on dates in cars. 'Most of them have been brought
up to respect hospitality. Instead of them being in an un-
desirable situation in faculty homes, they are in one of the
few spots that allows a personal setting. 'It is not easy
for a couple to plan their future over cllnklng.coffee cups
in the Union grill, under the frequent visitations by the
housemothers in the lounges, or knee deep in snow.

Paul Williams, the chaplain at Mount Holyoke college,
says he is proudest of the number of times his parlor has
been vacated for students. He said, “I look With happiness
on the malried couples I have helped as a chaplain." Are
we less trustworthy than the girls at Mount Holyoke?

With rationality and discretion, let faculty, students,
and administration come to a mutually satisfactory answer
to this in the hope that it will pave the way to such ac—
tion when it seems called for in the future.

SCARLET AND BLACK

State of the Union . . .

The Union is there. The juke box is
there. The rugs are roll-back-able. We sug»
gest a happy combination of all three on
Sunday afternoons in what is working at
many colleges nowiwhat was once a fea-
ture of Grinnell social life in years past.
This is the Sunday Afternoon Tea Dance.

This seems to be a likely solution to
freezing weather, non-swimmers, and any
one else looking for a pleasant way to spend
a Sunday afternoon.

Back in the days when the now-sell—
iors \‘lei‘e visiting the campus as wide-eyed
prospective students, the loggia was filled
with higheheeled women and coat»and-tied
men on their way to and from the weekly
Sunday afternoon dance in the rec room.

el'al less delightful aspects to this picture.

The formal announcement of this departure from trae
dition ran, “it was a question of printing them and selling
them, or issuing them in some greatly less convenient form
and restricting the number available.” ‘

A problem faces the college switchboard staff, how-
ever, the operators are required to ring women’s dorms by
room number, but in turn, can't require the callers to use
these numbers if students aren‘t expected to have herd
books containing these numbers. Looking up numbers,
especially during busy switch hours, should wreak havoc
with the “fast and efficient" switchboard service expected

by students and administration.

To the Editor: ‘

Concerning the editorial of
last week’s paper, I feel that it
does not represent the opinion
of the majority of the students.
You say, “grow up." How can
we grow up if the system that
favors it forbids us to do 507
Maturity implies that we have
the knowledge and the right to
choose between right and wrong.
How are we going to exercise
thls privilege if we have never
been permitted to? Dictation of
right is infancy, not maturity.

A few people have remarked
that this editorial was dictated
by the administration. This is
absurd because, the editor is ca-
palble of writing his own editor

Sincerely,
John Miller

Tc the Editor:

On reading the thundering
denunciation and ridicule heap»
ed on Merle Fischlowitz in Oct-
lcbcr 27': S a B, I decided to
reread.his letter, and examine
the heresles he expounded,

His feelings, it seems, are that
chapel attendance “is up to the
choice of the Individual." ruc.
ther, he feels that students
should not be “penalized" for
nonattendance by closing the li-
brarv and the student union. He
ithen closes with some rhetoric
on preserving Grinnell’s ”llb»
eral” reputation Heresy, indeed!

Alan Goldfarb seems to feel
that the “kick him in the teeth”
method is valid for reasonably
considering a problem, Dripping
lwlth sarcasm, he calls our here»
'tic a “literary lion" and a “so-
cial butterful,“ and finally just
batters him with an accusation
'that his sole reason for action
was “an egotistical desire to see
his name in print.”

union from going to chapel

2. Grinnell is founded in a
Christian tradition, and thus
there is right in pressuring
(King’s “removing distractions")
the student body to attend.

As to point (1), I agree yer
hcmemly. However, before shedr
ulng bitter tears over the dire
possibility, two things ought to
be done, First, find out how
many of the librarians and
workers in the union do go to
chapel now, Second, find out
how many would be willing to
work the hour, if paid.

Regarding polnt (2), I might
simply say that this argument,
carrled out logically, could be
an argument for 2. new Inquisi-
tion.

And, if this tradltion has no
root ,how will these closings
help? Can it he argued that
a student who cannot get a role
ercnce book because a matter of
no interest to him is being dis
cussed next door will feel more
kindly dlsposed to that tradi-
tion?

Well armored and eagerly
awaiting your replies, I remain,

Tea Dances--Possible?

The rec room in Main hall passed quietly
into oblivion the next year along with the

We now have the
