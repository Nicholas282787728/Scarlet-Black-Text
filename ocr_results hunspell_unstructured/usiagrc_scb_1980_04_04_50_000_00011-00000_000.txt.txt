“Too many cooks almost spoiled the
broth of this now classic anti-politician
gcnre iilm concerning the thinly
disguised Huey Long, politico, who
achieved lame by clcaning up long»
standing “machine" grail, only to
replace it with his own more
enlightened style or corruption This
inevitably (we would like it) believe,
present day evidence to the contrary
and Watergate notwithstanding) leads
to his downfall and also creates the
psychological impetus that leads to the
more permanent solution oi assassina-
tion, as it did with Louisiana's Hucy

the lead, he and Mercedes McCam-
bridge both won academy awards ior
their periormances, as did the picture
as best picture of1949. While this film
is only playing once I urge you to take
a “vidi” at it, lor it contains many
iine pertormances and is good tor you
history class people without you hav~
ing to work at viewing it; it is very en-
joyahle.

The Wiz is not a remake of the 1939
him The Wimrd of Oz starring Judy
Garland, rather it is a new adaptation
01 Frank Baum‘s famed children's
classic. This 1978 adaptation is really
a double adaptation since it was
originally a Broadway musical with
an all black cast. Alter its big success
on the great white way, Universal pic-
tures gained the iilin rights and pros

cccdcd to spend millions on its adapta»
tioil for the silver Screen.

If you talks are into spccial eiiects,
this lilin has more than its fair share
at them and from what I have seen of
it, the are all executed very well. My
book ll me that, “The characters
are played by some oi the most
delightful entertainers today and the
eiiectiveness and joy oi this movie
will make your heart sing." According
to the material available the film is a
MOTOWN production. This “truly
magic” iilm is coming to you in co-
Sponsorship With the Concerned Black
students and Black Martyr’s
Weekend The dancing is supposedly
very good, and i look tcrward to having
a good time.

process. she converts a mandarin
