@hitotiul

l-r is With regret that we notice
the death of one who stood as a
friend to Iowa College in her hour
of need, Mr. John I. Blair of Blairss
town, New Jersey. Mr. Blair was
an example ot a selfsmatlt: man,
rising from a poor country boy to
amillionaire Hislife was marked
by many acts of generos ity espe
cially in his home Blairstown,
where he was tlle founder of a ﬁne
academy, At the time of thc cy-
clone, in t882, when the college
buildings were destroyed, Mr.
Blair came forward and donated
some 517,000 in money and build-
ing materials, which was used tor
the erection of Blair Hall, named
after Illm Mr. Blair was rl man
of integrity and perfect honesty.
His gift to the college was only
one or the many by which he has
caused himself to be remembered

ON SATURDAY evening, Dec, 9,
will occur the annual interssociely
debate. which is the prelimrn
for choosing Grinnell’s rcprcs nr
tatives in the debate with Cornell
college.

The debaters for the home con-
test have been at “‘0th since last
spring irt preparation for this event
and the discussion promises to be
one of the closest and kccnest for
some years past. The subject is
the disarmament question, the
Chrestomathian society support»
ing the proposed abolition of are
miss and navies and Grinnell
Institute arguing against it.

Since the last debate with Core
nell, in the interest of which the
whole college rallied and worked
so encouragingly, the spirit of tlc~
termined and earliest effort in
prepcraticn tor the debate or the
current year has characterized
both societies in a gratifying way.
Two preliminaries have air-early
been held and on Saturday cvcn-
ing the ﬁnal team will be chosen.
In order to assure the best results
the debaters need the encouraging
interest ota large attendance. If
the college spirit is weak and dis-
interested on this occasion it may
prove a setback to the whole line
or errort. Every student or the
institution who hasour college dcr

hating team at heart should not
fail to nianilest it by his attend

ance Saturday evening, The dc. tl

bate will be well worth hearing in
itself and the occasion ought to
be one of great advantage to both
