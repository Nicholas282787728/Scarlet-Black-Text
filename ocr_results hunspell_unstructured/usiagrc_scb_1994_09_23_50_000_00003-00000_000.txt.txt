dents were able to
draw some conclu»
sions. Senior Grace
Beeler believed that
the focus of the welr
fare program often
lies not on the needs
of its recipients. but
on the needs of the
State. Beeler also
commented that, in
light of the com»
plainls and attention
being given it, the
welfare program
seemed to be the
“catchrall” program,
one that many people

strong Grinnell tie, here,” he said.
“It‘s really neat to see people from
Levin-Epstein‘s generation and from
this generation all interested in this
same topic.“

Indeed,desire lobe informed is
the magnet that drew many attend-
ing students. Iunior Laura Lockard
stated, “Many times people who are
uninformed about it tend to have
negative views about the welfare
system."

N outbreak of illness that
struck an estimated ten
percent of the student

population since last weekend is
spreading, Health Center nurses re4
ported this week.

The sickness, transmitted by
sharing drug paraphemalia, is not
effectively treatable, and threatens
to spread out of control unless stu-
dents take preventative measures,
according to nurse Rhonda Bayleaf.

“It‘s like an angry case of the
flu," Bayleaf said Thursday. “The
best thing we can do is to give you
cough syrup and aspirin, but you're
going to be running a temperature
and coughing for at least a week,"
she said.

Baylezlf said that the flu shots
given at registration are not effec-
tiveagainstthcillncss,dubbcd‘hong
fever."

Before visiting the health cen-
ter this week, at least one infected
student found that the illness per-
pctualcd itself. First~year student
KevinRiley noticed Monday lhathc
had a temperature, but did not visit
the health center until yesterday. “I
thought it would just go away in a
few days,“ he sold.

 

HUMOR:
“Bong fever” cripples campus

Having nothing to do but stay
in bed feeling Sick, Riley said he
passed the time by smoking maris
juana and taking naps. His water
pipe for smoking had been passed
around from mouth to mouth on
Friday and Saturday. “I had no idea
itwas my bong thatwas making me
cough,“ he said.

Another first year student. who
asked to remian annonymous and
to be identiﬁed only as “Donkey
Kong." said that someone left a
pipein his room Saturday “Ididn‘t
know whose it was, but I smoked
out of it anyway," he said.

“I don’t recommend sharing
pipes, bats or bongs under any cirr
cumstanccs," Baylcafsaid. “Espo
cially now, with the fever going
around, everyone needs to be extra
careful." She likened sharing drug
paraphemalia to unprotected sex,

”When you smoke a pipe, you
colne tncontactwilh germs fromevery
other person who smoked that pipe
since “5 last sterilization," she said.

Bayleaf mid she is fms‘l‘mled be-
cause the administration would not
allow her to distrubute an alloampus
mailing with recommendations for
preventing the spread of illness.

Note: This piece is humor. It is
not want to be taken seriously.

 

 

cems in the welfare movement: “We
need to think about the ways we‘ll
change ourprograms...Not [all wel—
fare recipients are] going to have the
same level of skills. The important
thing is, we have to take a step back.
as a country, and decide how we’re
going to respond to unskilled work-
ers.”
