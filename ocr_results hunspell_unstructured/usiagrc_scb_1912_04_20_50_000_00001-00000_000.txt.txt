GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY. APRIL 20, l9l2

BHINNELL MENAGED
BY TWII HIE-THAT’S

Titanic Disaster Brings Up Gen-
eral Subject of Precautionary
Measures as Applied to Local
SituationﬁNeed Tmperative.

Because proper precautions were not

taken , s' ‘(een hundred persons, needs

lesslv sacriﬁced, went to their deaths
on the shattered Titanic last Monday
morning. Survivors all agree that if
enough liie boats had been provided.
every soul on hoard might have been
saved.

u ils Grinnell has no crying need
ior lifeboats, merely a superﬁcial ex-
amination at her precautions against
ﬁre show it serious need or attention.
The two most conspicuous cases of
negligence are the Rand gymnasium
and Blair Hall, particularly the chem»
lstry department.

Numerous times during the year the
tower building is used ior social
gnthcrlngs, and on silcli occasions
there are usually irom two to three
hundred students in the building. If,
at any such a time a ﬁre should breali
out at the south end of the structure,
it would almost immediately block the
only means at exit, and leave those
within at the mercy oi the names. The
iact that a gasoline stove is used in
the south end at the gym, near the
entrance, whenever a banquet ls being
served makes the danger moi-c imnir
nent.

Remedy Very Simple.

The obviolis means or eliminating
this condition would be to cut a door
at the north end of the building or
the east side ncar the north end. While
this would entail a little expense, the
cost \lould he so small in relation to
the gain in safety, as to rule it out ol
consideration.

The other case mentioned, that of
the chemistry dcparunenlt. \lhile it
does not endanger so many people, is
oven worse because it - a tciistant
menace. Fires in chemistry laborator-
ies are by no means uncommon, and
while, up to the present time, nothing
serious has occurred, ther is no rea»
son to believe that it cannot happen
it a ﬁre should start in the lower
story, it would instantly cut off the
one exit from the upper stories, a
frame stnii-uay, inching it necessary
for the students to jump from the wine
dons. It a ﬁre escape was placed at
the rear or the side or the building it
would nliniinizc the danger. 1n a
town such as Grinnell is, where the
facilities ior ﬁghting tire are not of
the best. even more precautions should
be taken than in a city even it the lnu
does not l-cquirc them.

DENOUNCES INDIFFERENOE.

Urges College Men to Enter Politi-
cal Field Actively.

“The Great American Gums" was the
topic discussed by Pl-oiessor J. W.
Gannaway in an excellent Chapel tall:
yesterday. He distinctly stated that
he did not mean our characteristic
national sport, baseball. He reierred
to that contest which vitally concerns
every American, namely, the woi-ldeold
game or politics.

The great unlinoun in politics is the
nature or man, whose underlying mo»
live is selfrintercsL. However, in the
gamc ot politics, instinct proves it
more potent lactor than reason. The
politician is iniluenced by love, hate,
lenr, loyalty and he is only curbed by
tradition and authority. Man can be
best studied in the political arena
Eerresident Roosevelt by such state
ments as ”My hat is in the ting!"
intimates in a ﬁgurative way the hat-
iirc ol the political game. Politics is
not a parlor game. it deals with the
lives at men, and the prosperity oi
nations. it is a grllclllugt . oi coui»
age and character. it demands great
physical vitaliti and o trained, skilliul
'mll'ld. Tile late Senator Dollivcr and
Senator La. Follette noteuorihv
types of men whose playing oi tnc
game moi-its adiiiiratlon. The voiy
essence or politics is struggle ior sue
pi-ciuacy. Thi-u it lill sell-control is a
necessity to attain success we are
not in n position to lulliiencc others

u-oitliy lecture oi the game is that

Reports from the front concerning
the (oi-tunes oi Coach Brown's squad
ol hopefuls are very meagre, but suf—
ﬁcieut has been relayed in to let us
know that Grinnell was unable to dEr
{eat Upper Iowa due to the fact that
they scored 5 runs to the Scarlet and
hldc'k's 3, and also the fact that Fick—
en's Willow Wielders landed on Cos
to the tune of 23 to 5,

The account of the U. I. Ur game
sent in by special correspondent is as
follows:

The weather was extremely com
with a slight ruin tailing part or the
time. The game was called at 1:30
sharp, with Grinncll having ﬁrst outs.
Gi-inncll registered one in the ﬁrst
and another in the fourth, but Upper
Iou'i‘. came across with two in their
half, tying it up. Nothing happened
in the ﬁlth frame, but the Upstate/rs
again challicd up two in the sixth on
an unhappy combination of hits and
errors. Grinnell made a desperate at-
tempt lll the seventh which brought
form one run, bllt the Green anti
White brigade took advantage of some
more slips by Grinnell to Send over
another in the ninth, and Grinnell per»
ished miserably ln thelr half.

Fiche!) was the ,whole show {or
Giinncll, making ten strike outs. His
speed and Curves were cliective, hold-
ing the U. l. Us to four scattered
hits. The university team gave New-
comer gilt edged support, playing an
errol-less game. Grinncll lost
through costly errors with men on
bases, but nlulod good boll aside from
a law pcriods oi stage fright due to
inexperience.
