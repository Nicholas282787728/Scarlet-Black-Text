FOR A SCHOOL )LATE.

Christmas, the time of praise and of
mirth and happiness is rapidly all-v
proaching and'Setui-day night the one
clent traditions of the Christmas tree
will be revived in Gl‘innell at the big
all-college party that will be given by
the seniors in remembrance of the sea»
son. There will he presents for all
and the scene should be one of mirth
and enjoyment to the full.

While we are receiving our presents
in person, however, we should not tors
get one Who is unable to attend and
Who is apt to spend a. very cheerless
vacation if he is not remembered by
his classmates and friends.

Four years ago Mons chie came to
Gl'lnncll under the auspices Of the
American Missionary Society and en.
tered school here with the intention,
of preparing himself for a medical
course so that he might eventually re-
turn to his people in Liberia, a branch
of the Bantu cannibals, and labor
there as a medical misslonary among
his own race. His coming entailed tre—
mentions sacriﬁce and boundless ambi—
tion for he was forced to make his
‘own way in a strange land, wiﬂi prac-
tically no help from those who sent
him here.

Today, Chic is in a. local hospital,
Where he has been conﬁned for theI
last six Weeks with an acute attack}
of tuberculosis of the stomach. He
has been forced to drop his Work both
in and out of school and has been de-
prived of the means which he earned
to put himself thru school and to sup-
port himself. He is thousands of.
miles from home and is without
friends.

Saturday night, at the Christmas
party, the senior committee has plan»
ned to make a special Christmas gift to
Mona. Chle, a classmate, a mitn who
has the highest ambitions fur service.
and the entire school Will be asked to
join in the present its an appreciation
of the man and of his career here.
All students and faculty members are
asked to come prepared,

“IIER COME TlU‘l PIONEERS."

At 2L meeting of the Student Council
held Monday night, steps were taken
for the consideration and possible
adoption of the “Pioneer" song as the
official athletic song of the college.
The Council acted on this matter lit
the request of the Graduate Council,
the members of which are highly in
favor of the move. No deﬁnite resolu-
tion was adopted but the matter was
referred for further consideration with
recommendations that it should not
replace the college song, "Sons of Old
Gl‘il’lnell," but should rather serve as
supplementary to it,

This action of the Student Council
brings the student body one of the
vital Phases of school Spirit and
enthuaiitsm, the part that Songs shall
play in the athletic contests oi’ the

i used in the past, but it is not Dﬂi‘ticll.

day, There is no question in the mind'
of the careful ohserver that a school
song has a wonderful effect when'
properly played and sung. It not only
gives variety to the cheering of col!
lege rooters but it also has an encct
that cannot be gained tnru any, other
medium. Grinucll has long been in

the best that we have for the purpose.
This dues not mean that “Sons of old

background, however. Far from it,

The United states, Great Britain.
France and Japan all agreed to the
four party treaty proposed its. :t subr
stitute for the Anglo-Japanese alliance
and announced the matter to the other
delegates at the Disarmament Confer—
cues: in the fourth plenary session held

Saturday. The treaty was signed yeSr'

tel'day by all the delegates of the four
powers. However, the irreconcilable:
in the Senate are active in their ei-
forts to kill the treaty ilnd declare it
to be a second "Article X.”

'NAVAL DISARMAMENT PROGRAM
PROGRESSES
Latest developments in the naval
disarmament situation seems to show
that the majority of questions are
cleared up. Japan, however, wants
to scrap old ships instead of the new
Mutsu, built by national contributions,
and Great Britain and the United
States will doubtless concede, insist—
in: always on the same concessions
for themselves and on the 5,5,3 baSls.
Complete secrecy is being enforced its
the issue nears settlement.

With this in mind, the Council has.

to put the song selected before the
school in order that it might be given

Tentative plans are being made by

voted to learning this song and to Elva

What Do You Think?

To the Editor or anyone else who
can give it:

I come in search of information. .

01 course I laughed heartily at the
extremely funny episode of st goat be
ing turned loose in the loggia. Es»
pecially when something was put on
him to make him stiller. Did ever
any one see anything so humorous"
We trust that the instigators of that
bit or surpassing cleverness recognized
from the peals or hearty laughter and
shouts of enjoyment that echoed thru
the Quad how highly successful it was.

But since college is a place of ac-
quii-ing knowledge, and since I can do
so through this column without the
cuihaivassnient of revealing the fact
that l n ssed the point, I would like
to inquire just wherein lay the humor
of the episode.

I have understood that some times
insane and Ieehle minded people had a
bent for torturing creatures, out that
the only group that thought it Dal-r
tioulaily funny consisted oi small hays
from eight to fourteen years old. To
them there is something highly amus»
ing in pulling legs and wings off or
thiugs, and tying tin cans to calls. But
nly dull intellect had not yet grasped
the fact that such things were now‘.
in vogue among college mcn. To me, E
and to all whose opinions I have heard
expressed it looks like a hangover of
small-townrtougllism. If these oplnr
ions are mistaken ones I am sure we
would be glad of enlightenment.
