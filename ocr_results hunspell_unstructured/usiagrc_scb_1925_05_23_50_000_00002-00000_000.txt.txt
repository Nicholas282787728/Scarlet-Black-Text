The International Conference for

supported by Italy and Japan, has slice

inariiies, tau . and aeroplanes from
international control and the United
states, through its opposition to the
Arms Control Bureau controlled by
the League, has succeeded in elimin-

opinion in this direction,

French statesmen, bonercr, know
that Germany cannot pay and thei-
lore want the United states to take
Ger-man reparations on account. Ace
cording to George E. Roberts, pres
dent of the National city Bank of New
York, France's total national wealth is
about 67 2-3 billion dollars In laid
her debts amounted to to billion dol-
lars and have enormously increased
sincc. On many of these dcbts she is
paying niue per cent interest. Hei-
war debt to the united States in 1921
was tour billion dollars. She ou'c‘ a
similar amount to Great Britain who
insists on reaching tlrc same treat-
ment as tllt', United States.

No honest economist believes that
such enormous debts can he paid. No
Frcuch ml istci- could go beiore the
Frcuch peoplc with a serious propose
al to pay fulll billioir dollars to the
United States ior thc French people
believe that they do not really owe it
to us. They liuld that the money was
spent in the lliritcd States for war
supplies at enormous proiit to Allie“-
caii manufacturers, They claim that
they bought in an inflated market and
are ‘ ed to pay in n deflated market,
that. alter all, the money was spent in
a common cause, that thc United
states made its contribution in wealth
and Franco mailc hers iii man pou‘t.

Judge Kenyon, the other day in a
speech in Iowa, declared that the

Frcnch war debt to the United states ,

should be cancelled, that we owed
such action to France for her past
scrviccs to America. Public opinion
in America, however, is far from be-
ing ready for ally such step. The are
crage American doughlroy feels that
he was mercilessly gauged by French
shopkeeper-s arid that has had its rc-
tlex action on American public Opilk
ion.

sir George Paislr has declared that
oi all the nations that would suffer
lrom the financial collapse or France,
Great hritain and the United states
would sutier most, He says that fiire
they delay in strengthening France's
iinancial condition will be attended by
disastrous consequences. He believes
that it Great Britain would cancel the
French debt the American people
would eventually be willing to make
stsiniilar- contribution to world re-
construction.

If the cancellation or such debts
should be conditioned on the demili-
tarizafion of France and on an effort
to organize the n or ld on a new gasis
for peace, then it would be worth cone

To the Editor of Scarlet and Black:

It is as a rule a protitless and foole
hardy enterprise to criticize the Press.
It seems necessary, however, this
time. Your report of a. distinctive
and unique event, the All College Rec
wire, was to my mind and to the minds
of many others grotesquely unfair
both to those who were responsible
ior it arid to tbc rest of us who en-
1'03 ed it. The “criticism" was a blase
caricature or a serics of presentations
that were the result' of tireless labor,
by liaiit ingenuity, and air admirablc
spirit of ctr-operation, and that gave
pleasure to hundreds or people; for
we could hardly be mistaken as to the
enthusiasm and lightheartedncss of
the whole audience as we leit the hall.
It is true that some touches in the re»
port, such as the way in which praise
or Mr. Fuguy~Cote was dcltly turned
into a subtle insult, had wit, bill it
was wit oi the inexpensive kind that
is quite easy if 0110' is willing to be
disagreeable. The Revue, to our un—
critical and provincial minds, was a
joy all through. There were some
things I likcd better than others—the
Opera in Miniature and the scenes in
the Temple of Isis, perhapsihllt 1
had pleasure also in the colors of the
curtain, in the balloons, iu the joy-
ridc, in the playing or the orchestra,
. I thought we all did. And if some
of the productions were, as the critic
ggcsts, a. Swedish nightmare, I must
reply that be has discovered a new
glory or swcden: it is riot every peo-
ple that can make a nightmare funny.
There is a type of criticism that
sees bad in are thing, But it seems
a pity so to disilli ion us when we in
our topidity thought uc were justi-
iicd in having a good time.
or the s and B. who were not present
are amply aware how that Mr. Bilharz
riewcd the production with disapprove
a1, Very well. I liked it. So did ev-
ei-youe with whom I bare spoken of
it. It was to me one of the really
notable and successiiil events or the
year. If I had carried away nothing
but lIai-giicrite's rendering of the Jews
el Song and the impressive vision of
Isis on her throne, I should have—as
an enthusiastic youth near me put it
7”sul'e had my fifty cents worth.”
