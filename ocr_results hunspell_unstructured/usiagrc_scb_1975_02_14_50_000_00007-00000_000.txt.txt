“THE LONGEST
YARD a mwie that
cracks a lot of jokes.
And a lot of bones.
Burt Reynolds stars —
tough, sassy—and
always that tire.

The wrath of a
woman scorned starts
his trouble. However,
he’s got some wrath of
his own. And the last
45 minutes at the film
is unlike anything you
have ever seen It w
have you how ng and
cheering like no movie
ever has.

“THE LONGEST
YARD" is for men, for
women, for everyone.
