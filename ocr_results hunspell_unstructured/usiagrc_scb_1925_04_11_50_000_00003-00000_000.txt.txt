At the left of this group is Lieut. J. A.
Macready, U. s, A., rot-mer holder ofthe
world’s altitude record. Just behinel the

supercharger which kept the Liberty
motor running in the thin air, six miles
high.

Year after year, plucky explorers try to climb
Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak,
29,141 feet high.

With a G-E supercharger feeding air zit sea-
level pressure to the engine, an airplane pilot
can go far higher. Lieut. Macready has
reached 34,509 feet over Dayton, Ohio. He
would have soared over Mount Everest with
more than a mile to spare!

The tasks attempted for centuries in almost
every form of human endeavor have been
conquered with the aid of electricity, with
more than a mile to spare.

The impossible today will be accomplished
by men and women now in college. The
scientist and engineer are doing their share.
It remains for men and women entering
upon their life’s work to proﬁt by the new
opportunities that are constantly appearing
in every profession and vocation in theland.
