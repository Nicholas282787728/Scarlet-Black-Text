Hat (ha-thing: a plan
I guess what I want is a big hat. Not the stealth
skull cap of the tortuIed poet or the cool multicolored
knit number of the free-spirited soul. More like large
velvet boxed numbers with embroideIed flowers and
vines. Big ass straw sombrerus. Overwhelmingly sphen-
cal turbans. Dversized dunce caps. Gargantuan
propellered beanies. I feelthat a big hat would cap off
what has otherwise been a lacklusteI academic year.
Put. me at the head of the class. 0r block any son ofa?
that has made me sad. Hats on. Hats off? Hats on. Hats
off? Hats deﬁnitely on. To wax on and on eloquently

Damn you, rest of campusl Every week, an 585 ad
nges you to submit a random rants, yet that task
always talLs back on stIessed editors, unable to form
142 words of Coherence. I know that you all are funny,
you say funny things at the Forum, and in my educa-
tion class (well, things that I think are funny). Nor-
mally, I'd be there with you, Cracking wise—like, how
come vegans get to have ice cream and quesadillas at
Quad? Such pandering is deplorable, encouraging bad
behavior. or how about: I'm appalled at The Gum. The
front cover and interior were hilarious, good clean
fun (that no cool person could object to for any rea»
son) but the back cover crossed the line 1 love cam-
pus bikes, and hate your orange racism!

Oh, my woefully incomplete rants! Come up with
your own, Grinnell!

The double standard of patriotic fruit

I know it’s the end of the semester when the quit
at the dining hall begins to completely piss me off,
but nevertheless... I: there really any need to patriotize
the oranges? Even if you're into conspicuous displays
of America»love, a Iound ﬂag sticker that you'Ie going
to peel off and throw away doesn’t seem like the best
idea. Last week the protest dance people, myself
included, were repIimanded repeatedly for
“disrespecting” the flag, for not folding it properly for
putting it on the ground, etc. But you’re not supposed
to change the shape of the ﬂag, write on it and throw‘
it away either, The same (dumb) Iowa law that says
that ifs illegal to "disrespect" the ﬂag by hanging it
upside down out the window also says you can’t "deﬁle"
it, which I think should include putting it on fruit.
Either the police should arrest everybody at Quad or
the whole thing should just be declared dumb. That’s

what I say. " —Kr1tl'e Meat: ’03
