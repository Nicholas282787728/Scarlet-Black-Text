Eiection Procedures

We cannot condemn members of the election board for
wanting the eiltire student body to vote in Monday’s elec-
tion for Student Council president. It was an admirable
desire,

We can condemn them, however, for the methods they
used in getting olit the vote. ‘

According to the niimeographed sheet they put out
tllis year, one of their duties was to “secure adequate pub
licity.” What adequate publicity consists of could be debated. ,
We do not feel that telephoning halls where there were ln-1
dividuals who hadn’t Voted comes under that categor .

The election board succeeded in getting 93 pe cent
of the student body to vote. It is undoubtedly a record, one‘
to be proud of. But, was it ethically correct for them to‘
solicit votes?

It was rather evident that the election would be ai
close one. Fellows were ta ing bets on whether or not there
would be a 50 vote margin between the two candidates,
Pre-election predictions on who would be the winner were

'jhst about even Thus it has no surprise to discover that
only 25 votes separated the candidates. It 1)]‘0V'Cfl to be the
closest election in four years.

Because of the small margin of victory, we uuestion
even more the tactics of the election board. When it became,
evident to them, that an extremely large number of stu-l
dents had voted, they were eager to get 100 percent re 1-]
reselltation at the polls. They called halls where there werei
students who hadn’t voted and asked them to vote. This,
seems to us to be stepping out of bounds. Officials at polls‘
in city, state, and national elections simply sit and wait,
for people to come in and vote. They do not feel it either}
their duty or position to run around soliciting votes. l

Jim Morgan has assured us that the action of the elec-
tion board did not make a difference ill the outcome of
the election. He estimated that approximately 19 people
came to the polls after 3:30 when the telephoning was
started. It is evident that 19 votes could not make a change
in the final results. Nevertheless we do protest the action.

There were other things we did not like about the
election procedure. We did not like the non existence ofi
mimeographed ballots. Writ in ballots of white paper wouldi
be easy to dpulicate, not withstanding the fact that the of-
ficial ones were numbered—by pencil.

We did not like to hear about the fellow who went to‘
vote and found his name already crossed out as havingi
voted. We did not like to hear about the girl who wasi
accosted by a member of the election board and questionedi
as why she hadn’t voted. She had voted—but her name‘
wasn’t crossed out. -

The final paragraph of this year’s miineographed sheet
giving the “Revised Method of Electing the Student Council
President" s 's, “The election board shall give .a
of the actiVltles to a Student Council meeting on thei
operation, faults, and improvements of the election sys»
tem." We suggest they clip this and send it in.

except their own campaigns.
