explained its purpose. The new or-
ganization, composed of the so wom-
en who live in town, has as its aims
the stimulation of social life between
quadrangle and town women and the
securing of representation in campus
affa s.

A plan similar to the big and little
sister arrangement was proposed by
Miss Read, Under this system, a
quadrangle woman will be selected by
each town woman to notify her of
important meetings.

Invited to Dinners

Miss Read invited every girl to at-
tend Sunday night supper in the cot-
tage with which she is affiliated. She
also said that special dinners may be
held by the cottage for their affili—
ates. At all dinners given by campus
organizations, town women are ale
ways entertained free of charge.

The group suggested the ﬁrst
Tuesday evening of each month as a
tentative time for the regular meet-
ings, but it was decided, inasmuch
as other campus meetings may Con—
ﬂict at times, that announcement of
all gatherings of the group will be
ma‘de through The Scarlet and
Black.

Second Amateur
Photoplay Here

Students at Grinnell -college will
produce another photoplay this year,
the production staff of last year’s
picture announced today. “Treasure
Won", Lwo~reel comedy drama made
last spring, was successful enough
to warrant production of another
play with a different theme,

The scenario has not been decided
upon, but the one under consideration
is a mystery dealing with the United
States secret service. The production
staff will probably he the same as
last year with the story and direction
left to Maurice Birdsall and the pho-
toplay in the hands of George Cush-
man.

As/sooh as the Story is decided
upon, the cast will be selected. The
picture will probably be completed
and shown to the student body be-
fore Christmas time. Students inter—
ested in trying out for parts should
see Maurice Birdsall.

Campus Groups to Sponsor
Service Each Week;
Hipp'in Chatrge

student chapel, offered to Grinnell
college student representatives by the
faculty last year and refused, will
be inaugurated here next week. The
student council asked the faculty
this year for permission to hold stu-
dent chapel programs weekly and
permission was granted. The council
started arrangements toward this
end at a meeting in the quadrangle
Sunday,

Stan Hipp is chairman of the com-
mittee in charge of arranging chapel
programs. Others serving on that
group are Georgia Murray, Esther
Collette, Fillmore Gwynne-Vaughan,
and Ruth Goodenow,

Discuss Convocntiou

Mr. Hipp has announced that tentae
tivc plans call for various organiza—
tion to sponsor chapel programs, thus
taking the burden of responsibility
in each case from the student coun—
cil. Deﬁnite date for the ﬁrst chapel
has not been announced. ,

The council also discussed the pro—
gram for the next convocation which
is to be scheduled soon. The group
failed to decide whether it would be
in the form of an open forum as last
year or include several speakers on
a campus problem. Council members
agreed to try to include some music
on the program, however.

‘Ffivor Vocation

Recommendations as to reapportiam
ment of the semester fee this year
were decided upon and sent to the
faculty.

The council had voted unanimously
at its previous meeting to ask the
faculty for suspension of classes on
the Friday following Thanksgiving.
The present 1931732 Grinnell college
calendar calls for regular classes on
that day.

This vote was discussed again Sun-
day, members of the student govern—
ing group retaining their earlier
opinion that a vacation on the Fri-
day following Thanksgiving would be
desirable.

announced the wrong date for the At-
water Kant audition contest. It is

Minnesota Downs Oklahoma Aggies
for First Victory Over Valley Team

When Minnesota's powerhouse
smashed the Oklahoma Aggies for a
20 to a victory last Saturday the
Gophers handed the ﬁrst defeat of
the season to a Missouri Valley con-
ference eleven.

Valley teams, on the other hand,
have hung up a record of 10 wins
against the single defeat, Creighton,
Grinncll, Washington and the Aggies
have each collected a pair of scalps
while Drake was victorious in its
only tilt.

In piling up this impresive record,
Missouri Valley-s teams have amass—
ed a total of 176 points and held their
opponents to 43.

Aggies Lead

The Aggies lead in number of
points scored with a total of 59. How—
ever, the Stillwater team has seen
its goal line crossed the most for 29
points in all.

Grinnell college, doped an under—
dog, has surprised everyone by two
onesided wins, piling up 38 points
while Pioneer opposition has failed
to tally.

The Drake goal is yet unsullied as

 

the Bulldogs inaugurated the season
with a 26 to 0 win over Simpson.
Baker’s touchdown via the aerial
route marred Creigh‘ton‘s defensive
record, the Bluejays beating Baker,
26 to 7, and the University of Wyom-
ing, 3 to o by virtue of Captain “Wee
Willie" Worthing‘s field goal.
Drake Meets Creighton

Washington’s victims have been
William Jewell, 6 to a, and Illinois
college, 18 to 7. Grinncll has beaten
Coe college, 26 to o, and State Teach—
ers, 12 to o, The Oklahoma Aggies
boast a doubleheader win over Beth-
any college, 34 to U, and Northwest—
crn State Teachers, 25 to 9.

Drake, undefeated in the valley for
three seasons, ofﬁcially opens the
conference race Friday night at Des
Moines, meeting Creighton’s Blue-
jays. Washington plays its third con-
secutive home game, taking on West—
minster on Oct. 10.

Grinnell meets another Iowa
eleven, playing Cornell college at
Mount Vernon Saturday. The Okla-

Team Ready
for Grinnell,
Homecoming

Pioneer Triumph of 1930
Recalled by Purple

in Practice

(Special to The Scarlet and Block)

MOUNT VERNON—vividly recall—
ing a third quarter defeat at the
hands of a Grinnell college eleven
last fall, the Cornell gridiron squad
is eagerly anticipating an opportun-
ity for revenge before a homecom-
ing crowd at Ash Park, Saturday
afternoon.

Adding more fuel to the flame is .
the fact that Coach R. w. Barker
and his purple crew have taken two
trouncings at the hands of Chicago
and Michigan State respectively, and
so are still priming for the first vic-
tory.

Seven Men Lost

Weakened by the loss of seven
veterans of last season, “Dick” has
had no easy task in plugging up a
few of the holes. However, the
squad is above average in weight,
and contains some real football tal-
ent. Injuries have taken their toll,
the most severe being the loss of
Earl Gabrielson, Humboldt, who Ie<
ceived 'a broken collar bone in a
scrimmage preceding the Chicago
game. "Gabe" played a halfback po-
sition and did a share of the passing.

Crosby, Watson, and Morford have
alternated at his position since, none
of them salting it down yet. Several
sophomores have appeared in the
lineup with Osborn, 178»pouhd guard,
and Hammond, 177—pound guard

'holding down regular positions.

Wanner Captain

Haloupelr is a fixture at the pivot
position, with Warner and Anderson
at the tackles, flanked by Helmar
and Kuhnke, In the backfield, Lee
Adamson is a mainstay at fullback,
with Brandeau at left half, and Grif-
fin or Campbell calling signals.

The Furple's captain for the home-
coming fray will be Max Warner,
loo-pound alchidwest conference
tackle of last season. Warner was
recently elected president of the
senior class.

Six Pioneers

Have Injuries

A devastating varsity football
team, that swirled through yearling
ranks with uncanny shiftiness, kept
the frosh upset in scrimmage last
night and made one of the best show-
ings that has been made in Scrim-
mage this season.

Hank Thomas, calling signals, sent
the varsity men through their paces
and with forward, backward, and
lateral passes falling at all angles,
it was only after 20 minutes of
scrimmage that one proved incom-
plete.

Gratin-id Out

The air attack was well mix-
ed with a running game in which
Thomas showed his heels to tacklers
regularly and McCreary managed to
pickup yardage regularly.

Fritz Graflund and Frank Duncan
are out of practice this week, the
former with a wrenched back re
ceived against the Tutors and the
latter as a result of an infection.
Golz is still on crutches and James
and Rose have not been in scrim-
mage. The last two returned to
the squad in signal drill yesterday,
however.

Trumbull Hurt

Mark Trumbull, 190-pnund sopho»
more, who had been counted to fill
a guard or tackle gap in the line,
suffered the return of his shoulder
injury Tuesday, and will probably be
lost to the eleven for the major part
