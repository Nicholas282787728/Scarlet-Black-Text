The second aspect of Selfr
Governance is unfortunately
bureaucratic. Self-Governance
should mean, ideally, that current
students have some say in large-
scaie campus decisions. Forgive me if I misrepresent
the administration here, but it seems like they hold
our opinion only a couple notches above the opinion
of the Fed E\gt

Imagine this. Should the mavens over at US.

us to make committees, read bylaws, argue with each

But why shorrldrrt we put up a light? The admilr
rstiatron may propose a new set of
dorms, brrt students will have to
live in them. So we should have
somc say in campus politics Even
it we only stay here for four years
at a stretch. Even if our opinions
might go against Osgood’s Strate-
gic Plan.

This campus can seem cold.
More than ever, as Grinnellians, I think we have a
responsibility to care for one another. We do care for
each other, certainly But sometimes we might not

. have time enough to show that care. Perhaps, as Iowa

gets colder and darker, we could try to think about
what we can do to show this care.That,l think, would

Bye-bye, IA

Dear Iowa Politics,

It really breaks my heart to write this but, well
i've found someone else. It isn't your tatrlt,1 really li e
you You are so strong and intluenria and some or
your friends (Palmer and Hiirkiii to name a few) are
really great people. And I will never forget the thrill
of berng wrth you during November 2004. You were
there for me in the dark trrnes and not a day passes
that you don't tell me how important I am or how
much yrou love me, but those are just words.

It just feels wrong for no [0 be involved with you
Honestlv, I have never ally understood you I it an,
Im a girl fiom a big Southern city and you are. well.
youre a cornael d. How am I supposed to know what
tar trs need: And who am 1 to play a put in decid-
ing what goes on in Iowa> l'nr only going to live in
Iowa for another year and a half

The“ someone new" is not really new at all Ive
known Tennessee politics for a long time and 1 tLally
understand the issues Tennessee is facing (Also, Ive
always had a thing tor Harold Ford Jr. lie has repre-
sented my district for years and I lost my votergin-
ity with him, Now that he is running for Senate that
old spark has once again rgnrtcd.)

I really hope you understand. You are always tell—
ing me how irnporrtant and inﬂuential you are and
tranldy I’m beginning to get sick of it. You may be
big and important, Iowa, but Tennessee is important,
tool This isn’tjust about Harold, either. Other factors
like the gay marriage bill. education and dealing with
Katrina refugees in Memphis are things that affect
me and my family.

Aganr,l enjoyed my tune with you hurt think it
would be better itwc don't scc each other anymore,
This is t a “take time off" type ofthing. What wc had
is over. warmest regards.

P.S.- Ii'] someday decide to live in lowa tor longer
than {our/ s, I'll call you.

Chet and Eric

It s an interesting and important time of the rear
for Grinnellians. Yes, i iall, ind whether voli ic
watching Prayer-I Rmiturrv or [Mam/try Nig/i/ Fae/brill,
tlrcr- s soruetiung an- more pressing to kccp on your
radar

1m writing today because I know most oryou on
reasonably personal basis Whether we pass on the
sidewalk, or youve heard me tumble an answer rrr
class, (3 rnell is a tight-knit community. similarly,
i'rn writing because I know two orthis you s electoral
candidates on a very personal level, and 1 know that
they would do our community well.

Chet Cirlvci, our Democratic candidate for Cow
ernor, has been a close friend otmy family since I was
ﬁve years old, Similarly. I've had the personal priv-
elege to get to know and spend time with Eric Palmer,
our candidate for the Iowa House of Reps.

I write further, thatI particularly encourage you to
vote for Chet and Eric for an important reason. Not
only are they wcilrroundcd, and able to articulate why
they feel compelled to change our community for the
better, but more importantlyithey’re good and hen-
est people.

I personally frnd comfort in this. Yes, their inter
est is actually in the well-being ofyoung women and

men, and they understand what it means to represent
us. As Griune ians, we should cherish the oppottur
nity, Get out and vote Your ﬁve minutes now will be
evident come January.

Week of Love

At Glinncll, we like to think of OUISCli’CS as an
cnirghrcned. liberal and t’cmrnist community. We be-
lieve that we live in a hcalrlry and open-minded entri-
r-onrncnt. Howevcr, itwe an: honest with ourselves, we
realize that the relationship nrany otus have with our
bodies rs often Llrallenging, inconsistent and hurtful.

We are self-conscious, undercduc ed about and
disconnected from ourselves and our bodies. \Ve are
afraid to , .it up to cont‘rorrt the truth or our own

’uagc and to c above the unhealthy and um
rL- istre ideals that sociLty h ct for us This is why
Love Your BodeVeek rs neee riry and relevant,Tliis
is wliv we continue to organize the week.

The Feminist Action Coalition hopes that Love
Your Body Week will create a space tor an open dia-
logue between all gcoders about the universal struggle
to come to terms with oneselfand one's body

our hope is that each and every person learns
something about themselves and from each other
during [his week—whether that knowledge comes
out of an open discussion of anatomy, masturbation
and sex; a movie on the effects otadvertising on body
rmage rn the U.S., or simply from the act otbrrngrng
these issues to the {entrants ofout minds and (hater
t’ore increasing our awareness.
