IOWA TEACHERS ASK CUTS

Grinllell students have often endeavored to pro-
cure a more liberal cut systcnl for juniors and
seniors in college. \Vhether such a move would be
advisable .or not is problematical. At the present
time, however, Grinncll does have a liberal cut
system.

The College Eye, student newspaper at Iowa
State Teachers college in Cedar Falls, is conducting
a campaign for a more liberal cut system at tllat
school. At tlle present time every eut taken by a
student at the Tutor school must be accounted for
by a written excuse, and even with this help the
student loses a tenth .of a credit for each cut.

The State Teachers football men were surprised
when they learned of the liberal cut system here,
and spoke highly in favor of it, The privilege of
17 cuts witllout penalty looks good to a student
Who is used to losing half a credit for ﬁve, even
though excused. The practice of ﬁning .a dollar an
hour cut on the day following vacations is also
liberal, when compared to the policy of some .of the
state schools. There are cases where an unexcused
absence in any course on the day following a va
cation means the loss of an hour‘s credit in that
course.

The College Eye presents the aspect Of the
student body ill ﬁnding the cut system at State
Teachers too severe. After all, a student must

\achieve a certain amount of responsibility and in-
dependence ill college, and a fairly liberal cut sys-
tem is a small step in that direction.

Grinnell’s cut system, in all probability, would
work to the satisfaction of both students and facul~
ty at the Teachers college. Although liberal, it does
not permit enough cuts to allow a student to miss
classes other than (luring emergencies. It places a

premium on hours lost through cutting, and thus
prevents an overloading of courses [or makeup
‘ work. It is one of tile privileges of which Grinllcll
stndcnts are proud.

LABORATURY BOOKS DISAPPEAR

Disappearance of books from the, shelves of
the psychology laboratory, and the almost silnul»
talleous removal of books from the chemistry lib-
rary indicate all unfortunate situation on the caul-
pus.

Undoubtedly there was no intention by those
who took the books to appropriate them permvar
nently. It is probably true ill many cases that solue
who did, did so because they lacked the chance to
do required reading in the classroom during the
afternoon or evening before closing time. Even
this group might have asked permission.

The unfortuntc result is that non-offenders
were unable to get the material which they needed
every day, because the books were not returned the
morning after the removal, ill most cases not sooner
than a week or two later. After much difﬁculty,
some books were recovered and the situation
remedied by placing them on the reserve shelf in
the library.

\Vllat is wrong? To take books from a class
room and keep them for a week is to steal them.
Worse yet it. is a case of individual beneﬁt at the
expense of social beneﬁt. The alibi, “I forgot,”
only serves to emphasize the point that the offend-
er must be selﬁsh.

The practice of taking and keeping books is
now being worked in the chemistry library, where
rigorous rules have not been installed to prevent it.
This is unfortunate. It is a practice which is not
tolerated ill the business world.

GRINN'ELL SYMPATH'IZES
(From the Carletonlnu)

Grinnell college, whose teams have often encount-
ered Carleton teams, sent the following telegram to the
Carletonrnn through its school pnper, The Scarlet. and
Black: "Grinnell sympathize: with Carleton in the denth

(From the Wnslungtnn high school Pulse, Ceanr Rapids)

A criticism of awards at the Iowa High School Press
association convention st Grinneil was lnuncbed by a car
tain daily newspaper asserting that. schools winning
prizes had alumni of Goinnell college on their
faculty. To correct this statement. it can be stated that
only two of six high school Winners have Grinnell grsd-
Hates t'o‘r edvisors. Pulse representatives to the confer-
ence heard nothing of dissatisfaction about awards, find-
ing the whole session enjoyable, with no suspicion of
anything but courtesy and fairness to visitors. Though
inst year we had three awards, this yen-r one, we didn't
