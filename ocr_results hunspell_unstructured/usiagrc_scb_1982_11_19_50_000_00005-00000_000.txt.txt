Yes, the Brooklyn faculty was excited by
e core. (Incidently, it was Brooklyn’s
aeulty and not their dean or some other
idministrator who asked for it.) But
.rooklyn’s problems are not Grinnell's.
iscusi was quick to point this out and was
ot ashamed to admit there were pro-
ilems. (For example, there is no real in»
egration in the cure, no interdisciplinary
ork going on.) However, one sensed that,
ven if Viscusi and the Brooklyn taculty
id not know where their core program
ould ultimater lead them or if it was not
.olving the problems it was meant to solve,
hey were more aware of these problems
an anyone else and were constantly
.truggling and working at it.

It was Viscusi's eagerness and genuine
oncern that most impressed me. He was
oncerned about the type o1 education his

t.udents were receiving and with address-
ng the problems of the institution itself.
hat became very clear to me as a result
as that those who are espousing a core

ing some kind or punishment on the

there for, I told him 1 wanted a drink. 1-1e
ooked at me suspiciously as if 1 was there
o play some kind of sport. 1 fidgeted and

en promised I wnuld not win at anything

in the building. The guard smiled and let
me pass through; 1 had chosen the right
words. The supple curves of the fountain
evoked Such emotion in me that I nearly
stumbled backward, but I did not, and in-
stead drank. Still too warm, but getting
loser. ‘

Having been disappointed by the water
fountain in Main, I next went to Cowlﬁ.
The water fountain stuck out. of the wall
like a giant beacon, screaming for so
meone to quench his thirst there, to suck
down it's transparent liquid. I bent over
and drank. Wow! Now here was a cold
fountain. 1 shared at the line of people that
seemed to stretch forever into the Cowles
dining room. As 1 looked at it, my hand
resting on the fountain, I wondered why no
one had moved in ten minutes. [decided at
last to join the line and see. After moving a
bit (contrary to theory it does move) I
passed the ice cream machine, the
lumbering hulk hummed with electricity,

a huge piece oi black tape over its coin
slot. Why was it on? No one had ever used
it. I shrugged my shoulders and continued
to amble towards the serving bar. After
getting food, I went to the lemonade
dispenser. It is my personal opinion that
Grinnell’s kitchens serve some of the best
lemonade in the country.

Cowles, the ecsmsy-producing lemonade’s
taste still in my mouth, I looked towards
Norris, “Hie prison." The warden met me
at the door, his strange lace frightening
me, his worn features bespeaking the cons
tant intake of intoxicants that most of the
inmates partake of. He asked me what I
was in for. 1 told him of my quest and he
just laughed. He kept on laughing as he led
me up to the fourth ward, up to Norris 'west
fourth. There I bent down and, lo and
behold, there was ice! Ice‘had shot into my
mouth! The robed figure appeared. He
patted me on the back. Another day over,
oh well.

studenu for years of bad academic
behavior; somehow the few, the Very few,
who graduate from Grinnell having indulg-
ed in specialiution at the expense of a
liberal arts education are reason enough to
reprimand the entire study body and to
lock the faculty into a core they will un»
doubtedly tire of quickly.

Brooklyn has no advising program,
Grinnell does. My guess is that many of
their problems could be resolved if so-
meone in the school were made accounr
table for-meeting each student’s needs.
Perhaps the answer for Grinnell would be
me institution of some kind of distribution
requirement (an obligatory 12 credits in
each division or some other magical
number than makes us well-educated). In
the end'. this would allow the students to
tailor their course work to their individual
levels of proficiency and give a little more
strength to the advising program. I would
be very surprised, however, if this
“magical” number is not already matched
by an overwhelming majority of Grinnell's
students.

Open Space ,
Explaining the iudicial
System

The students at Grinnell College are for-
tunate enough to operate under a system of
self-governance. This praupposes that we
conduct ourselves in such a-way that we do
not-encroach upon the rights of others. It
also necessitates a mechanism for dealing
with the unfortunate instances where one
person’s act harms anodier, or the com—
munity as a whole. _ a

At many colleges and universitia, the
judicial power is entirely vested in one of» .
ficer of the institution. Grinnell handles
this issue differently in a much less air-
bitrary and more equitable manner. The
college Judicial Council is made of of five
students (of both sexes, from north, south
and otf<carnpus> and two faculty
members. These people are responsible
for seeing that all defendants receive a fair .
hearing.

It is important to note that the Judicial
Council operates as a fact finding board,
First it decides on the basis of the facts
presented whether or not a violation of a
provision of the Student Handbook has in-
deed occurred. Then the council is made
aware of a student’s past disciplinary

record, which it takes into account in mak-
ing its sentence recommendation. ‘

The last word is crucial, All the council
is empowered to do is recommend a ’
sentence to President Drake, who reviews
the council‘s decision and has the power to
overrule it if he finds it either too harsh or
too lenient.

In conclusion, several points deserve ad-
ded emphasis. We have a judicial system
here that deals fairly with all involved, and
one which is clearly superl to one in
which a single individual is judge, jury
and executioner,” The members of the
council make difﬁcult decisions on behalf
of the whole college community, They do”
however, remain a part of that small com-
munity. In protecting the rat of our rights,
they have not given up their rights not to
be harassed in the wake of a controversial
decision — especially when they are not
ultimately responsible for that decision.
Those who violate‘the few rules in the Stu-
dent Handbook are themselves responsible
for the use of judicial sanctions against
them.

To the Editor:

Last year a member of Younker’s Hall
Council told another member of GCGC and
myself that he would be ”goddammed" if
he ”were going to a party with a bunch oi
queers and faggots." As this person is no
longer here to defend himself I hesitated,
quite naturally 1 think, from mentioning
this in my previous column. Given this and
the fact that both this year and last year
the Younkers and the GCGC party were
run concurrently, what other conclusions
could I be expected to arrive at?

The Younkers party or even an “alter
native" party is not the issue or problem;
from all accounts both were well-attended
and met with great success, The issue is in-
tolerance, the issue is the Vandalism and
hosit ity that has reared its ugly head this
year. As I stated in my column, I’m sure
those who are responsible are a slight seg-
ment of the campus community, and i am
hardly ioolish enough to believe that they
all reside in Younkers. 7 Sincerely, John

Correcting
‘Correciness Corner'

To the Editor:

It has been with considerable interest on
my part that 1 have been avidly perusing
on a weekly basis the tascinationinspiring
weekly installments of “Correctness Core
ner" in die Memo. By way of sharing an
idea or two with you, I’d like to contribute
the following inrdepth analysis of a
mistake that lots of people commonly
make.

“Having never possessed a desk, the
Caucasian bureaucrat was not leaving a

tell-tale tail of smoke wistfully wafting ’
‘ away as he walked."

What is wrong with the above sentence?
First of all, the word “bureaucrat" is
derived train the French word “bureau,"
which means “desk,” whence a (wo)man
utterly lacking with respect to the suc-

cessful implementation of a desk acquisi-
tion procedure cannot be properly termed
a ”bureaucrat,"

Second of all, the word "bureau" is
derived from the old French word “bure,”
which semantically indicates the concept
of “dark brown.” Thus our friend the
Caucasian government functionary once
again ought not be subjected to reference
by means of the erroneous title of
“bureaucrat."

Third of all, and conclusionachievingly,
the word “bul‘e'Y is derived from the Proto-
indoEuropean root “'pur-o,” which in the
olden days designated a fire or torch. If
our esteemed civil servant was indeed a
“bureaucrat," (s)he would necessarily be
maintaining a state of burningness at at
least the detecmbly smoldering level, if

. not higher, thereby emitting an unques-

tionably visible trail of gaseous,
oxidationally-produced etrliivium. Since
the alleged person in question has been ex-

plicitly characterized as being unaccom-
panied by any sort of phenomena in terms
of vapors, which is to say, he/she/it/thou
is unescorted smokewise, it is undesirable,
irresponsible, reprehensible, and bad, to
sanction the generation of the contradic-
tion which inevitably occurs when the
abovementioned parsonage is associated
nomenclaturally with the identification
oriented entity “bureaucrat." So don‘t do
it. e Prescriptively yours, Kevin Lang
