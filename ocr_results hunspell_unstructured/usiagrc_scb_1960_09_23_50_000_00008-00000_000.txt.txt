couple of year-s Jerry Gray
set in Cowles and observed
the Gsinnell 1m. program.
Griilnell male students had
grown accustomed to reading
his slanted outlook on 111155,
which was almost presented
as a sort of view from Cowles'
terrace.

dition going, Ryd Wallerstedt

Our own 1M. football sclleﬂr

Kent trophy as the eventual
prize. Cowles again brought
llome the coveted prize last
year bv placing high in almost
all nine sports.

This was the second year in
succession that Cowles has walk
ed off with Kent and could re
tie it by repeating last year's
feat, Last Veal"s race was a vcrv

close one in which Cowlcs edgedi

out North and Rawson by less
than 100 points, .

North started off strong bv
Mill‘ning the football trophy with
a 7-1 record while Cowles and
Dibble tied for second, In looking
over this y'ears race. there ap-
pears to be no really strong

team to beat. _

Rawson will have its hie linc
retaining and with the help of
fast freshman backs, could win
a lot of ball games Last year s
winner, North, lost it's top passer
in Don Olson and its line power
in Bob Hewitt but with Joel
(the flash) Prescott at the helm,
they should be among the top
contenders again this year.

AI Convention

I
As state 'cllzlil'mzln from Vinl
ginia of the “Students for Stev-l
enson" movement at the nit-l
tional Democratic convention
this July, Mike Horwatt, Grin
nell sophomore,
gates from Virginia and' the
midwesterii states in ali'attempt
to gather votes for the party’s
former standard bearer.

From his participation in a
national political convention, ,
llorwatt observed in an inter-
view that many delegates are
motivated not by nationnlgpur- ,
poses but by petty local con—
sidcrations.

He said many appeared to
have no perspective of thc na~
tional scene and looked at a
candidate only in the light of
how many votes he could pulli
in their ward. This is true. Hor»
watt said, in both political
parties and can. in part, be
remedied by cleallvups on local,
and state levels and by inclu—
sion on these levcls of informed
citizens with national concerns.

Horwatt, the only Grlxlnell
student in Los Angeles ‘for
the full run of the convention.
was on thc floor when Stev-
enson made his tumultuous
entrance. By the night before '
the first ballot, Horwatt said,
he and other workers for
Stevenson could count about
127 votes pledged for the ex-
governor from Illinois.

While at the convention, Hon-
watt stayed with the floor mane
ager of thc Stevenson forces,

partner ol Wendell Wilkic and
