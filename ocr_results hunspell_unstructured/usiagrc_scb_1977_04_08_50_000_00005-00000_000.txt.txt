ﬁlm" by Todd Rundgren‘s

Utopia, produced by Todd Rund-
grcn lor Alchcmedia productions
on Bearsville Records.

Despite some personnel changes,
Todd Rundgren continues to put
together an imaginative group of
musicians. “Ra,” though a bit
strained and pretentious in places,
is Utopia’s lirst completely studied
effort and is imaginative and
solidly musical.

Ari eastern ﬂavor permeates the
album. Cuts such as “Communion
. ' h the sun," “Singn‘ng and the

ass guitar" and “Hiroshima,"
while fun and interesting, show in
places unnecessary triteness and a

dency to become synthetically
losophical.

However, the music more than
compensates ior that slight
shortcoming. Kasim Sultan, John
Seigler’s replacement on has, has
a fine voice in addition to his full,
fluid bassmanship. Roger Powell,

heir of the keyboard duties alter'

the departures of Roger Shuckett
and Moogy Klingman, con-
centrates on wailing synthesizer

effects and sequencer rhythms in
addition to piano and clavinet
work.

Although it is evident on “Ra”
that the band is contributing much
more material, essentially the
album is pure Todd. “Magic
Dragon Theatre" is a bouncy tune
akin to H1056 pop-ish melodies
heard on “Something-Anything"
while “Jealousy” is a plain
straight rocker (and a pretty good
one, too). The songs are well
recorded and produced, the high
points being clear, crisp vocals and
John Wilcox’s thudding drums.
Those oi you who heard Utopia's
first album may be able to extract
some similarities, but probably not
too many. Good ideas run ramp-
ant, and while the album rock and
rolls only limitedly, the
creativity of these music'i'ans
outweighs any mistakes It you are
3 Todd freak, “Ra” Will be
delicious. If you aren’t, it’s worth a
spin.

“Works" by Emerson, Lakc and
Palmer, produced by Emerson,
Lake and Palmer for Atlantic
Records, Inc

“Works" is lc.lassicalrrock. It’s
not classically inﬂuenced rock;
parts of it are not even rock at all,
Orchestrations abound in praCr
tically every cut. while this may
please some, the album itseli is of
mixed listening quality. ‘

Previous ELP recordings, like so
many other offerings in the rock
scene, are classically influenced,
yet rock ‘n roll in the traditional
sense. ELP’s uniquely gifted
musicianship sets them apart from
the rest, however. in “Works,” the
orchestra ousts the rock and roll,_
but the musicianship is still 3p.
pa rent. The album, ELP’s seventh,
is structured so that each of the
three musicians composes,
arranges, produces and performs a
side.

On Side one, Keith Emerson’s
“Piano Concertu No. l” with the
London Philharmonic Orchestra is
exactly that—a fullrfledged piano
concerto in three movements, with

A small town treasure

Q.

I come from a small town, so
mil thatGrinnell, in comparison,
appears to me as a goodlyrsized
city. There’s no barber shop in the
town i grew up in, let alone a
supermarket. a bakery, a fabric
store, pharmacy or high school. We
do have our share of drinking
establishments and churches,
however, and we do have a library
iounded by a group oi women one-
hundred and fifteen years ago.

Grinnell’s Stewart Library
reminds me of the Brewster

les' Library back home and the

se and Snow Libraries in the
neighboring villages o[ West
Harwich and Orleans, Perhaps it is
a quality oi small town libraries
Wthey seem to have a terrific
su ply of practical books.

0h, there‘s plenty of heavy stuii.
too; but it’s the practical project
book that nearly always grabs my
eye when i go into Stewart along
with the little children and their
parents and the junior high kids
and the senior citizens.

The project books there are
many and diverse. One can learn
how to convert a van into habimble
living quarters. jamjellies. make a
c or dry a ﬂower, build a
cement wall or survey an acre,

One can also find cook books for
Mexican, Chinese and French
cuisine. For. general editication
one might sélect a book about how
to quit smoking or cook without
sugar. And if a quiet evening is in
order, one may draw upon the
whole collection of P G.
Wodehouse, or one of the new
social commentary books like The
Fall of Public Man. '

Now an entire column could he
dedicated to that very subject, but
since I am to be kidnapped
tomorrow and taken to Dubuoue
and then, my abductor threatens. i
may have lunch in Illinois and tea
in Wisconsin, i must shortly retire
to prepare tor the trip, You see, 0
sunrbronzed ones, i haven't been
out of the state Since August 1976.

To conclude then, Stewart also
sells back issues of some
magazines. The other afternoon I
found a May 1972 edition of Esquire
containing articles by Nora
Ephron. Stephen Spender and John
Cheever. not to mention my very
favorite writer of them all, George
Frazier.

George Frazier never wrote a
book and none has been written
about him He was a columnist
wlth Esquire and the Boston Globe
up until his death three years ago]
lived without the words of George
Frazier for three years until last
week when We were reunited in
Stewart as old lriends in ecstacy.

ningham's, it only costsa nickel.

the fine romantic tradition
dominant. Noticeable here are
iavorite lragmenls and rilts of
Emerson, easily discernable by
Emerson freaks. Very satisfying
listening for classical buffs.

Lake contributes some mellow
songs on side two in which his
golden voice and acoustic guitar
prevail. Though “C‘est la Vie" and
“Lend your love to me tonight” are
quite pretty, a few others resemble
intentional top to chartgrabbers.
One exception is “Hallowed be thy
name,” a rhythmié concoction of
bizatTe orchestrations, dissonant
piano, and interesting playson-
words.

Carl Palmer and an array of
percussion-oriented tunes make up
side three. Bach's “Invention in D
minor" played on the vibes is nice,
though original pieces such as
“LA. Nights” and “Food for your
soul,” while rock and roll, seem to
lack guts. “Tank” is an or-
chestrated rework of a cut off
ELP's first album, A comparison
of the two versions should prove
the first to be more enjoyable.

1977—pnge 5

“Ra ,” solidly musical ; “Works ,” mixed quality

Side tour consists of two pieces
in which all three musicians work
together, “Fanfare for the com-
mon man," an Aaron Copeland
piece arranged by Emerson, is
dominated by Emerson’s syn»
thesizerian interesting cut,
though Emerson gets a bit carried
away in his improvisations, which
take up most of this one. “Pirates”
is an omately arranged work, with
Lake‘s vocals sharing the limelight
with the orchestra.

With the exception of side one, it
is in fact the orchestra's
dominance throughout, and the
almost Sterile overproduction
which make “Works” less ens
joyahle than earlier ELF. Three
years were spent putting this
album out, and it sounds too per-
fect, too thought out, not spon
taneous enough. Obviously the
classics are a strong inﬂuence on
these three “Works” satisfies
their taste for it. Another record
should be following shortly which
perhaps will display what ELF
does bostmprcvidlng some of the
most unique rock around.
