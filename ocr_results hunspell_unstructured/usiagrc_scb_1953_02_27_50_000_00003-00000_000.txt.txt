‘Andromaque'Exeuﬂed SkHHtu

by Steve Fischer

Last night in the Arena theater Grinneli theatergoel-s were
given a startling and unforgettable introduction to French classic

drama with the [production of R
direction of Norm Cohen.

Racine has been appropriately named the ”painter of the dis-
orders of love." Norm’s “reproduction" was Superb. All the shades
of the spectrum of passion were admirably rendered: dcspondency,
melancholy, brooding, anger, violence, and folly.

While missing from the cast
of characters in the program,
the presence of Fate was cer-
tainly felt in all his power.
Ellie Park, While a bit weak in
the first act, more than warmed
up to her role in the second act
and turned in a magnificent
performance in the role of An-
dromaque. She showed the
poise, pride, firmness, and'he-
role humility so necessary for“
a full portrayal of the charac-
terr

Jim Leavenworth was outs
standing in his presentation of
the Uhalf loving, half angry"
Phyrrus, giving the audience a
Well rounded picture of the
king plagued by' love, honor,
and pride.

Nancy Weinfeld, in the role
of the impassioned ‘femme
fatale' Hermione, showed a keen
perception of and feeling for
the part as evidenced by her
unleashing of just the right
amount of emotion. The role of
Hermione can easily get out of
hand, but Nancy showed a,£ine
sense of control. '

Jim Stewart also showed an
acute awareness of the diffi-
cult Character of Orestes, For if
not ,handled carefully, the fate-
ridden Orestes becomes nothing

, more than a milksopr

A particular word ’of praise
should be paid to Joan Fuhr-
man. ,Her costumes showed
fine taste and artistic refine-
ment.

Norm should {be congratulated
for his sensitive interpretation,
as should the cast for its ex~
cellent execution of this in-
terpretation. *

ABoui' Change

The student Council Thursday
voted in favor of a showdown
on what they considered the
“administration's policy of not
informing the student body as
to new regulations until long
after they have been decided
upon."

Specifically, ,the council was
referring to the announcement
in the new catalog that students
would have to supply their own
linen and towels next yeari

Charles Anderson, south
Younker sophomore, asked that
the administration publish full
information about changes in
regulations as soon as is gas»
sible.

Dave Ferguson, north Youn-
ker sophomore, requested that
(Norris Neveln, college control-
her, explain to the Student
Council the entire situation, in-
cluding the disposal of the linen
fee which is now charged, and
the absence in the list of fees
for next year of a charge for
health.

Monna Caudle, Main fresh-
man, asked about the possibil—
ity of installing television sets
on north and south campuses.
lNo decision was made for north
campus, but the council asked
the social budget committee to
study the chances in the quad.
