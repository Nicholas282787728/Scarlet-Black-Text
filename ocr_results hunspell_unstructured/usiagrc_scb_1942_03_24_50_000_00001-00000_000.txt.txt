By Clyde Bates

Gl‘innell students won’t be
able to tell a campus beauty
queen from a pair of jacks,
a full house, or the ace of
spades after the smoke clears
away this weekend on the
“Great Queen Quibble,” Stll'v
red up by promoters last
week.

With a new Grinnell mot-

Burma Stricken After
Holding Party for
I? Faculty Members

Possibility of an involuntary
spring Vacation was heing
considered on campus today,
since 19 faculty members
may have been exposed to meals»
les Friday night while attending
a party at the home of John
H. Burma, instructor in sociology.

Students did not escape the
Week-end developments. Stcwart
McElravy, Dibble sophomore, was

taken to the Community hospital .

with measles on Monday.

Burma developed the disease
over the Weekend mill was cona
fined to his home yesterday.

According to Miss Florence
Swan, collcgc nursc, thc infection
may not be so widesprcad as the
minor, “The infection dcvclops in
the patient about twciityfour
hours before the rash appears.
Mr Burma. may have had incaslcs
Sunday; he was not really ill una
til yesterday. Therefore there is
a good chance that faculty mem-
bers who visited him Friday night
were in no danger of infection.
Howcvcr, we cannot be certain
for from 14 to 21 days.”

Mrs. Burma reported last night
that tho Grilmell instructor had
served all the guests on Friday
night. "He was being a psrfcct
host; but it seems hc may have
given away a few germs as well
as food.”

Baumann Boos
Friday Night
Open House

The scope of social activities at
Grinncll, already pared to the
quick according to some obsel’v-r
ors, is due for another trimming
if the plan of Frederick L. Bau-
niann, associate professor of his»
tory, gets the official nod.

Playing to a definitely depleted
audiences for several Saturdays
past, Mr. Baumann last week
blow the war situation right out
of the Far Eastern history class—
room with his suggestion that all
Friday evening social functions be
abandoned in order to assure a
proper represcntotion and an ac-
ceptdble degree of participation
in Saturday classes.

Best method for achieving such
goals is, according to Baumann,
the general practice of Saturday
tests until the idea of keeping
Saturday work up to the regular
standards is firmly entrenched.

“But I am not a Beowulf," de-
clared Baumann, in a qualifying
statement. “I am in favor of a
inid-wcclt vacation and period of
social activity for the students.
This would give them the reloxa
tic they seem to need, and it
would avoid the long interruption
of a two-day weekend, which most
people arc taking now, whether
their sciiclulc so specifies or
not.”

Recalling that a mid-week vaa
cation was once suggestcd as‘an
inherent part of thc fourshour
system, Baumunn said he did not
think it was ncccssaiy, but adds
cd, “I am over 50."
