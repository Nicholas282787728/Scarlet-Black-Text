wants to promote every student of Grinnell college seeking a teaching position
for next year.

Please write me for enrollment blank.- If I do not offer'you u better
position than you can secure through other sources you are under no ﬁnancial

and ambition to get a college educa—
tion, no matter what their financial

situation is.
The Des Moiues Capital is one of

tbe‘statc papers that has taken rccog-r

nitibn of the plan, and has the follow—
ing comment to minke on it:

D. w Norris, editor or the l\
shalitown Times Republican and a
member of the executive coininit-
tee oi the Grinnoll Cullege'cudou‘r
msut campaign is the author of a
plan which will harp young men
and women of small means in
ﬁnancing a college education. The
plan was substituted to the board
of trustees of the college and was
approved at the last meeting.

Mr. Norris, a Grinnell graduate,
proposes the sale of educational
bonds by the college These may
be purchased by students and par—
euts on the partial payment plan.
The payments may cover a long
period of time and in this way the
purchase may be started before
the prospective student is ready
for college.

Another feature of the plan calls
for the foundation of a trust come
nany which will p- vide a means
of ﬁnancing the Norris scheme.
This institution will he known as
the Bankers Trust company of
Gl'innell. The company wrll hold
mun y in trust, will pay four per
cent ntercst, and will issue col-
iateial trust certiﬁcates, Money
will be loaned to students in Grin—
nell college but the company will
not do a current checking account
business.

The third provision of the plan
calls upon Congregational church
societies of the middlerwest to
endow scholarships in Grinnell
college. The individual soci-
eties will be permitted to name
persons to whom the scholarships
will be issued.

The relationship between Grins
nell college and alumni like Mr.
Norris is most fortunate. Grinnell
graduates have been a. powerful
factor in the rapid growth of the
college during the last few years.
They have been lenders in the na-
tion-wide movement to get former
students back of their alma mater.
No other college or university in
the country has made more of a
success of this plan. The Grin-
nell spirit is good for the college
and it is good for the state.

By allowing a student to attend col-

lege, and pay his debt to the college
in 8. large number of Small payments
covering a rather long period of time,
the college does what no college has
hitherto done. It expresses conﬁdence
in its own ability to so ﬁt students at.
tending Grinnell, that they Will he
successful business men and Will be
able to pay back the cost of educat—
ing them. In other words, the college
uses'ils own ability to make successful
men and women as security far its
loans. It makes resell more or less
TESDOBSlble, and this expression Of
conﬁdence in llSelf as :L builder Of
men is something that no onlher col—
lege has ever done in a financial way.

The signiﬁcance of such a move has
hardly been realized by those of us on
the campus. Here is a college that
has turned out so many successful
men and women that it feels sale in
placing the price of tuition against its
ability to train a student.

It seems to be the inherent right

 

lot every college student to "crab",
land of every alumnus to criticize. At
ﬁts worst, however, crabhing is of
some help to those against whom it
iis directed, if it is really made hnown
lto them, and not lfept in the undercur-
rent of campus talk. Every leader‘
.welcoines what he calls "constructive
criticism". Even just plain criti—
cism, w—ithont any'constl'uctlve sug-

thing, lor the director of an industry,.

knocks he gets, feel the success or
failure of his Work.

Crabs can be either harmful or
‘helplul, according to the real wish of
the crabber._ By directing a criticism
to the proper person or department
in question, the crab becomes a help
to the person under fire. By merely
going around and crabhing to fellow
students, he becomes a propagandist,
an agitator, stirring up people against
the object of his crrt ism, without
any chance for the person in ques-

if there is crahblng, it means that
someone is dissatisfied. Dissatisfac-
tion spreads easily, and the facts
should he faced, whether officially
brought to the attention of the per-
son or body in question, or not. We
can idealrze all we want, but that is
not stopping the trouble. Too often
optimistic people who are used to

alright in the end.

This is not facing the facts. Crab-
bing is an indication of dissatisfaction
and dissatisfaction is not a help to the

nrent. To keep down dissatisfaction
is to hasten the success of an under—
taking. If by showing a little interest
in some pet crab of a student, his
harmful crabbing will be turned into

nothing. I-lis clause may be small, but

about something, and he should be
humored.
