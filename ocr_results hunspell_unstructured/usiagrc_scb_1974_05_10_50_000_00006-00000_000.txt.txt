The “golden record” is the big
prize that song writers and singers
get when their hits have sold 2 mil-
lion copies.

But‘Grinnell College PresidentGl-
enn Leggett has the “silvertray”
tor a much rarer kind of hit -- a
book on grammar and usage thathas
gone well over the million mark.

Over Million Sold .

Prentice-Hall, publishers oi the
“Handbook for Writers," by Deg-
gett, C. David Mead, and William
Charvat, announced that the volume
has sold more than 1,100,000 cop-
ies since 155 first publication in
1951. ,

In a recent presentation in New
York, Leggett received an inscri-
bed silver Iray for the record per-
formance.

Howard M. Warrington, board Chv
airman ot Prentice-Hall andaGrinr
nell College graduate, said that the
book, now in its sixth edition, “has
guided several generations oi coil-
ege students in America and abroad
through the intricacies oi the Eng-
lish language and the craft of writ-
mg." ,

English Teacher

A teacher of English before enter-
ing administrative work, Ieggett
completed L'he original edition otthe
handbook as an assistant professor
01 English at Ohio State University.

With his co—authors, he worked on
later editions as associate protes-
sor of English at the University of
Washington, as vice provost and
provost of, that institution, and as
president of Grinnell College.

He is quick to note, that he is
not only president of the college
but also a professor of English.

“I don’t teach any formal cour—
ses,” he says, “but I can still
look stemly at a split infinitive or
a dangling participle whenever one
comes across my desk -- or, as is
more likely, when [see one in some-
thing l’ve drafted myself."

National level

On the national level, Leggett ser-
ved on the Commission onEnglish
ot the Colle e Entrance Examina—
tion Board CEEB) for the period
1959-65. After several other com-
mittee and trustee assignments, he
became chairman oi the CEEB in
1972 and will complete his mnure
in the top post this year.

How well is the English language
used today? ”1 think Americans
could do well to concentrate on
the problem a-lot more than they
do," leggett says.

“We need more discipline, more
clarity, more order in our expres-
sion. And this doesn’t mean that we
have to give up style and creativity.
It’s simply a matter of making our-
selves clear, which of course isn’t
simple at all.

Plain Sense

”We all want to sound sophisti-
cated and important in our wri-
ing, so that we often end up with
jargon instead of plain sense. So-
mebody today might write, for '
stance, that ‘it is a major necess-
ity that illumination be provided’
when what is meant is ‘let there
be light,’ as it says in Genesis.
The first statement is quickly for»
gotten; the second has lasted for
centuries."

Leggett is the author or co-auth—
or of several other books on writ-
mg.

Three New Releases Shine

by Steve Hirtle
Dr. John, The Nite Tripper, seems
to improve with every album andhls
latest on Atco, DesitivelyBormaroo,
is no exception. Mac Rebbenack
(Dr. John) has mellowed with age
and like a fine Wine, it hasn’t hurt
a bit. Not only has his voice im—
proved, but the vocal and horn ac-
companiments blend in perfectly
to make this LP one which makes
you feel like you’re in the right
place at the right time. At bit slo-
wer and a bit smoother, Desitively
Bannaroo is Dr. John at his best.

onquake, a Fantasy album by a gr-
oup of the same name, does it. Led
by the talents of Havaness Hagoplan
on acoustic and electric guitars, el-
ectric sitar and synthesizer, this
trio does everything from a coun-
try tune, “1 Couldn’t Hang Around,”
to hard rock. Although Moonquakle
needs a little more polishing to be-
come a top-notch group, this al-
bum oertajnly shows more talent
than comes from the ave rage sheet
of vinyl coming out of California.

Another tight album is the latest
by Alan Ross on list) Records, si-
mply called Ross. With a voice si~
milar to Stevie Winwood’s and an
incredible aptitude on the guitar,
Al Ross leads a live man band with
a driving rhythm section of Steve
Emery on bass, Tony Fernandez on
drums and Rueben White onpercus-
sion. With Bob Jackson filling in on
keyboards, Ross becomes a fine
lesson in basic rock. Again it’s not
one of the super albums of the se—
venties, just a good clean LP, with
simple, pleasant music waiting to
be consumed. ’
