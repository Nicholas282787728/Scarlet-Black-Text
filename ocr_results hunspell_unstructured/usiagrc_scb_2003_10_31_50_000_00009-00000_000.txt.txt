Harris’s Horriﬁc Halloween

Multiple identities and multiple pedophiles in’this weekend's movie patch: much scarier than any haunted house or Harris party.

Brad’s Fun Swedish Fact: Swedish children
have gotten their wishethis year there will be a
white Halloween in Stockholm. Actually,
Halloween isn’t celebrated very heavil ‘n
Sweden, but 1 L'Xpett that you all will pickup the
slack,

K: End, this weekend in Grinnell is going to
be iefrcshing indeed, since the film committee
did a nice job offering its real Halloween
experience.

Identity (R)

K: Technically speaking, Irlt‘nnly is worth
seeing, given that John Cusack is soaring with his
latest hit Riivrririy/ioy and has already otab.
lished a decent name after the higlily-uccluimed
Being/Mm Mr/tovi’c/i, and that James Mangokl is
not a bad director (Girl, [tiri-ittirprrr/ got an
Oscar).

Personal opinion: You MUST see this horror
ﬁlm! its a nice marriage ongatha Christie's
”\vhodunlt” and Stephen King‘s clever twists of
plot, with directing that's good enough to
highlight the genius screenplay We have 10
people packed into a deserted place by pure
chance, and then they are gruesomely murdered,
one by one. However, the story doesn't end there,
since it would be another predictable Final
Destination. sandwiched between gruesome
murders is a discussion cm a multiple homicide

case caused by a guy suspected ofsufrering from
multiple personalities, which leaves us with a
wondering “11mm" while watching people
mysteriously disappearing. The end is brilliantly
unpredictable. Despite all its gore, Idewrriy is not
a cheap thriller. You're left figuring out the end
long after you're done with this original horror,
B: Counterpoint: Despite several chances to
sceIr/eiiri'ry, I've missed it. Missed implies that I
actually want to see ii orcourse, which really isn't
the ease Even ifHarris was separated by Just
Eighth street and not the Atlantic, 1 wouldn't
watch what looks like a derivative horror film.

Capturing the Friedmans (NR)

13: The Friedmans were your mneof-thccmlll
Long island household, until the Naussau
County Sex Crimes Unit charged that in that
household, Father Arnold Friedman and youngest
son Jesse Friedman committed a combined 352
counts ofcliild sexual abuse. In the mid-19805,
Arnold and son taught computer classes in hrs
Great Neck basement, where according to the
authorities. they took advantage of their students.

There wru one other way that the Friedman's
were different from the typical American simily:
they were home video fanatics who taped a
multitude ofmeals and conversations. This
extremely inedcpth documentary proﬁles the
family's breakdown in a very voyeuristic way.
Once die allegations against Arnold and Jesse
surface. each Friedman’s loyalty to the family is
questioned, with some relationships irrevocably
destroyed Much ofthe material is so private that
the audience has to feel guilty watching, yer can't
turn away because it's so involving. This film
proves Just how much people like to see a good
train wreck, even ifits only within one family,

Child sexual abuse is a delicate issue to
discuss, especially when discussing the adult
abusers. Director Andrew Jarneelti masterfully
acknowledges the immense psychologiml and
physical pain that abuse causes children, but also
shows how in the case of the Fliedmnns, it's likely
tape was cried ,ust as witchcraft claims wracked
Salem. How does a man abuse classrooms of
children for several years without anyone finding
out?

paraphrase an old saying, truth is BETTER man
fiction. Harris should be packed with people
tomorrow night. nursing their hangovers and
nuising their thoughts on tape scandals, family
scandals and the scandal that is film itself.

K: Do you think all Japanese movies are as
innocent as cute little Sfirited/Ilmy Then you’re
in for a traumatic enlightenment. Arrdi'n'otr is a
well-directed nightmare that disturbs even the
most hardcore Fan of the genre. The ﬁrst half of
the movie vaguely resembles a porn plot, with a
widowed film exec staging auditions, searching
for a replacement for his lost half stiangely living
up to his expectations of something ”bnuuful,
classy, obedient," a former ballet dancer

gracefully steps into his studio, only to cuise him
for good, The headbowcd, constantly.drcssed.

feverish psychotic experience for well-teased
viewers who have been breathlessly following the
storyline.

i don't think MPAA has any available rating
for the disooncerting torture scenes in Aiditian,
which should make us appreciate director
Taltashi Miike’s talent even more since he
succeeded in incorporating horror tricks and
artistic editing into a well.written seiecnplay that
brands this horror film scorching in our heads.

Lost Highway (R)

K: This is a very complicated plot to follow
since the protagonist doesn't seem to keep track
ofhis “self" either. i really don’t underscand this
movie. One saxophone player is charged with the
murder ofhis wife and somehow magically swaps
places with somebody else, in a locked oell.
people who don’t question the logic ofa piece of
art may appreciate LosiHigheoy helmed by
decent director David Lynch. who knows how to
create excellent sound and visual elfccis.

Movie Times

Capturing the Friedman:

by Nathan Smith

The B/xr: Kit: is a Chinese ﬁlm is ostensibly about the
sufferings endured by one family during the great leap forward.
on its most basic level the movie is a political condemnation ofthe
itrationzllties and human fallings that drove the Communist
regime to destroy die lives of those it supposedly libemtcd, And
though it deals with concrete political events and culture The Biro
Ki'ir's defter psychological mechanisms turn it into a sort of
existential Fable of human resilience,

Since The Blue Kit: is often about events d-int are meaningless,
capricious and unchallengccble, itseldorn grains in characters or
the audience the comfort at narmtive structure wrthin which to
make sense of the often tragic events that befall them. The
characters neverseem particularly exceptional and much ofwhat
they do seems mundane and irrelevant. The ﬁlm is structured
more like a symphony than a story with the structural unity
coming more from the themes, matifs and mlsc-cn-scene than the
actual :vcnrs themselves. The famous climax of the movie

involving the titular blue hire is more a bringing together ofall the
movies themes than a resolution ofthe dramatic problem.

The color and sound design are particulaily amazing. I was
constantly disappointed that I didn’t speak Chinese bemuse ofthe
tendency ofthe film to use RobertNtman-mqu: overlapping of
dialogue, which the subtitles failed to catch. The structure of
speech seemed particularly important because one ofthe films
most interesting motifs was its use of thatcwhichcwncleﬁ-unsaid.
This motif, like most in the movie, analyees in great depth the
abilities that allow humans to live in a world that they neith
control nor can make sense of. The subtlety with which this is
displayed makes this movie both extremely challenging and
extremely rewarding. Anyone who watches ﬁlms for escape and
relaxation could easily be disappointed by this movie because it
provides neither, What it does provide is much harder to find in
movies: political protest without demoniration and the heroic act
of being unable to be a hero.
