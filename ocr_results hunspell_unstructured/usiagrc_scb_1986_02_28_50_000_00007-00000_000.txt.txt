The Marriage of
Maria Braun

by Dave Lilienstein

Rainer Werner Farsbinder's The Mar-
riage of Maria Braun. for which Hanna
Schygulla won the best acress award at the
Berlin Film Festival, is another feature of
this semester‘s Foreign Film Festival
The following review is taken from Stanley
Kauffi'nann’s column in “The News
Republic.”

[The film isn't one minute Old before we
know we’re in the hands of a skilled,
unhackneyed director The first thing we
see is a picture ol Hitler hanging on a wall 7
An explosion. The picture disappears, and
through a hole blown in the wall, we see a
German soldier and a girl in bridal
costume whose wedding has been intern
rupted by aerial bombs. If that isn’t suc-
cinct and graphic filmmaking, what in the
World is?] . . . The script tells the story of
that bride, who spends just one night with
her husband before he leaves. After the
war, she hears that he’s been killed. She
gets otherwise involved. l-le returns, and
goes to jail for killing the (black)
.Americansoldier by whom she’s pregnant,
although it was she who broke a bottle over
the soldier’s head. Later, Maria gets in
volved with a rich businessman, although
she keeps insisting * as she has done all
along g that she still loves Braun and is
his'kvﬂle: When Braun is released from
prison, he leaves Germany for a while
because (we later learn) the rich man is
dying and persuades Braun to let Maria be
with him until he dies Braun returns after
the rich man's death. He and Maria are
enriched by the dead man's will, An explor
sion occurs with a gas stove. Braun and
inﬁrm are blown up, fulfilling (i guess) the
hipg'in‘which they were blown apart.
”The Marriage of Maria Eraull will be
shown on Thursday, March a at 10:00 p.m.
in South Lounge, German wiﬂi English
subtitles.

Never Cry Wolf

by Jonathan Greising

(1983, 103 minutes)

Though ostensibly a nature film, Never
Cry Wolt moves far beyond other Disney
productions of that genre,

Director Carroll Ballard (The Black
Stallion) deliversa visually impressive
film, but the center of interest is the
development of the character or Charles
Martin Smith (Terry the Toad from
American Graffiti).

Smith is a bookish biologist hired to
determine whether wolves are responsible

for mass killings of caribou by observing ,

them in their natural setting. His deter
mination to prove himself sustains him
through his initial inexperience and his
deepseated fear of the wolves.

Showings will be Friday, February 23, at
9:30 p.m.and Sunday, March2at7:30p.m.
in ARE.

The Tales of-
Tris and Ella

— as narrated by James Embryo

Teatime, it was: time for tea. From
behind her desk, our sultry librarian pro
duced two steaming mugs of tea (it was
teatime) for our woolly friends.

"Baaaaaa," muttered Tris and Ella.
One noted scholar (Frank Janus) feels
that they meant by this sound to say thank
you to the librarian, another, argues that
Frank Janus is a “jerk and a fool” and that
“we must keep;‘uppermost in our intern
pretations mat Tris/Ella cyclonic ans
tipathy which figures so prominently in
later parts of our story (or is it a
legend? l”; the present translator keeps in
mind the fact (and it is indeed a fact.
verified by psycholinguists of all colorsl
that Ella had spoken English previously in
her existence, which implies that she could
darn well say “thank you” if the situation
arose.

Not to disgress: “l'm glad you could join
us here at HillBrook Memorial Library;
the tea’s on me." .

“Baaaaaa,” muttered Tris and Ella ap
preciatively, nodding their shiny heads in
unison.

“Most sheep here speak English,” tact-
lully replied the librarian. .

“Do they?” asked Ella.

“Ich bin hier," said Tris, who. as it turns
out, only spoke German. “Du bist hier
auch." he continued, turning to Ella. “Wir
sind hi i“

“You know," tactfully continued the
librarian. ”I really hate that man sitting
next to us here. I’d like to kill him, right
now, even as he turns red in the face and
raise: his ears. standing his hair on end
and making this librarian look foolish, this
librarian who has worked and strived
and——”

“Baaaaaai” cried Tris and Ella as they
ran through the huge glass library doors
into the street. ”Baaaaaal"

At which point they bumped directly into
a Nenturian.

What oh what oh what, you ask (wonder-
ful reader), might a Nenturian be? Ami
what is the effect or bumping into one? And
what about the antipathetic qualities of the
Tris/E": ralationship?

Lo. foolish reader; Part IV awaits.
