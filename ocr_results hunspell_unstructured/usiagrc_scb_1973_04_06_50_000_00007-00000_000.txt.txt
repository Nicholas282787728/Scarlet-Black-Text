FALSE TELEPHON E

CHARG ES ENRAGE
BRANDEIS

(The Justice)--Erandeis University and the New
England Telephone and Telegraph Company are em—
broiled in a continuing controversy over responsir
hility for $12,500 in long distance telephone charges
made from the Brandeis campus and charged to
fraudulant telephone charges

in an effort to collect the money and prevent
more charges, New England Telephone has r6*
moved pay telephones from a number of residence
halls. However, student and administration reaction
to the move has been mixed,

Some students have had private telephones in-
stalled in their rooms, but others have urged that
Students not install private phones, and that none
pay ally money owed to the phone company because
of the pay phone removals.

In addition to the lradulant long distance calls,
the telephone company asked Brandeis to pay lor
the replacemeilt ofa vandalized instrument, College
administrators refused, and the damaged telephone
was not replaced,’

UNIV. NORTHERN IOWA

(Northern lowan)~The firing of Campus security
Watchperson Marge wrage has created a major
controversy at the University of Northern lowa

Ms. Wrage was the tirst female member of the
Cedar Falls campus’s security force, and was
fired on March 2 for “failure to accept the duties
of a Security Watchman as detined bythe University
of Northern low and the inability to work in har-
mony with other watchmen”.

A number of students protested the dismissal,
and a hearing on the firing was scheduled by the
University. The hearing was planned as a closed
session, but considerable protest had developed
over this procedure.

 

 

 

Personal Perspective

 

Urban Studies 'Important’ In College Career

by Jane Freidson

Grinnell is a nice place It’s one at the 47 safe
places to live. But too often, people who live here
forget that there is a whole world beyond Grinnell.

The Chicago Urban Studies Semester is one off—
campus program about which students should
be educated.

Briefly it consists of 4 areas of study: the Core
Course, the seminar, the work assignment, and
the independent prciect. orinnell gives 12 credits
for the semester with an option to receive 16
if one produces an additional independent project,

The students live in apartments rented and turn»
ished by ACM in Chicago. The areas in which the
apartments are located include Uptown, Lincoln
Park, Near North, and Racine (these vary slightly
by semester, the 4 I've mentioned are the north
side areas offered this spring).

Each area is considerably different from the
average ACM campus and forces a somewhat

COE COLLEGE

(The Cosmos)—-Coronet Food Service is being
plagued by an extreme version of a very common
problem -- student “borrowing" of food service
silverware.

The problem has become acute in Coe College’s
dining hall, and the food service has not taken
steps to alleviate it due to rising food prices.
Columnist Beth Trimble notes that, it the thefts
Continue at their present rate, there will be no
silverware by the end of the year and “food will
be provided, even if you have to eat it with your
hands”,

RIPON COLLEGE

(College Days)--Ripon College Students seem to
he more dissatisfied than most with their news—
paper -- and the newspaper Seems to be having
more problems than most attracting staiimembers.

A number of recent letters to the editor have
attacked almost all aspects ofthe paper, [rom layout
to bias of content. Few writers seem to agree
about exactly what is right or wrong with the Dnys,
however.

Members oi the Days staff appear equally con—
cerned about lack of student interest and input for
the paper. A quarter page ad in the March 2 issue
read, ”This white space occurred because no one
gives a damn about their college newspaper", fol»
lowed by a plea for staff members.

ST. OLAF COLLEGE

(Manitou Messenger)»-The editors of the Munitou
Messenger have been the center of a lively con—
troversy at Northiield. Recently, the editorial
board of the paper decided that advertisingiormil—
itary recruiters or the school’s AFROTC program
would no longer be accepted.

Following several rounds ofletters, thepolicywas
eventually revoked by the St. Olaf Publications
Board. Letters commenting on both sides of the
question were still appearing in the paper several
weeks after the final decision had been made.

altered perspective of society onto the student.

For instance, Uptown is composed oprpalachianS,
American Indians, and other non-indigenous
peoples, all poor and most dependent upon day~
labor as their only source of income.

The academic side of the 131373!ng is struc urpd

twice a Week in the Core Course. Readings are
assigned to Supplement the lectures and discus
sions, Often people outside of the program are
brought in to speak in order to offer a different
View of any given situation.

For me, the Urban Studies program was the
most important thing I’ve done since coming to
Grinnell,

1 think that 8 semesters of Grinnell College
is unhealthy both emotionally and academically.
I believe that everyone should get out of Grine
hell for at least one semester. And I would
certainly recommend the Urban Studies Program.
