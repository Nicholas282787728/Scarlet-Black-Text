Coca- Cola boycott must go on

Although the student initiative to reinstate the campus boycott of
cocA- cola fell short of the so peAeenr needed to pass, LASG does
not regard the vote as A failure. We believe it is significant that a clear
majority of studcnt5755 percentivoted in favor of the boycott,
Over half the Grinnell campus has sent a message to Cocarcola that
its business piactices contradict their values. Whether the boycott is
ofﬁcially recognized by campus or not, we encourage every student
7 and not just those who voted “yes"ito uphold socially responsible
consumerism by reducing their consumption of Coke products.

Wed also like to addiess some lingering mAsconcepnons about
the boycott and LASG that have been raised in recent issues of the
$83.

First, there are a number of concrete and reasonable actions that
Coke can take to respond to the human rights violations taking place
in its ftlcrotlcs. Both Professor Lesley Gill ofAmerican University, in
her presentation to the Human Rights Committee ofthc American
AnthropologAcal Associanon, as well as the New York City FactrITlndr
ing Delegation, presented a number of possible actAons avAAlable to
Coke in their reports.These options include: formulating a coherent
policy apinst the collaboration between any employee, contractor or
agent of the company and the paramilitary forces; establishing the per
sition of a human rights ombudsman or a human rights commission
in each bottling planr in Colombia; creating a fund to compensate
employees and their families who have been \n'ctimizcd by the parse
military violence; and dropping retaliatory charges against employees
who ﬁle complaints in court.

Second, we would like to respond to recent comments question-
ing the effectiveness ofcorporate boycotts as a tool for social change.
There are countless examples of boycotts that have succeeded in the
past, including boycotts directed at Coca-cola. The boycott ofcoke

in south Africa in the 1990s played an important role in the abolition
ofaparrhcid

Global boycotts, such as those dunng apaAthcAd as well as the etu—
Aent campaign called by A Colombian union, begin with individual
choices, When you drink a Coke you are sending the company a mCSr
sage that you approve ofthc wages, the working conditions, the union
status and the management’s response to the deaths of workers that
aie embodied in that beverage. As consumers, we have the power to
create a more just world by supporting socially responsible businesses,
and withholding our support from those whose practices are unjust.

Third, we would like to clarify some misconceptions about the
activities of LASG. In the S {9’ B staff editorial, “Ivory Tower to
Trenches" (Nov. 11, 2005), the author states, “many students united
to develop an ideological opposition to CocarCola do not investigate
the exploitation ofLarinos in Iowa."Contrary to the author’s assump
tions, LASG addresses issues affecting Latin America on the local,
national and international levels. Currently, LASG is collaborating
with student groups, professors and local activists to organize a sym
posium on Latin American immigration and Iowa to take place in
January Others have suggested that we should target the School of
the Americas and us. foreign policy towards Colombia. LASG has
worked and continues to work on these issues and invites anyone who
is interested to contact us for more information.

The boycott against Coke is one small, yet significant, step we can
take in fighting for justice as members of the global community We
urge students to use their power as consumers to send a message to
Coke that their business practices are at odds with our walues and that
continued inaction is unacceptable.

SCIPE, SGA: No one ’5 voice silenced

Last Monday Nov. 7,, the Student Campaign for Increased Polk-r
cal Engagement (SCIPE) and SGA cabinet cosponsored an open
forum about the student initiatives. Unfortunately, nirnors that the
forum was unfair and biased are spreading among some students on
campusThese accusations are baseless.

SCIPE and SGA Cabinet organized the open forum in order to
foster student awareness about the initiatives, promote dialogue and
increase voter turnout. Therefore, we made sure that the initiative
authors would have time to present and that the students attending

every other non-author student' in the audience We understand that
Mr. Postman was disappointed not to be accorded the status of an
initiative author, but this decision was based upon the fact that he had
not submitted an initiative for consideration by the student body.
The opposition to the Coke boycott, as well as to the other eight
initiatives, was recognized to present at the open forum, Before the
event began, the SCIPE moderators informed the audience that every
snident-at-large would have the option to make a statement or ask a
question, which would be limited to one minute each due to time

would have the opportunity to make statements and ask S—uestions. constraints However, students were able to raise multiple statements

Max Postman 08 requested before the event
to have time reserved to present his opposition to
the Coke boycott initiative. SCIPE denied» this ,6,
quest on the Nov. 3 and again on Nov. 6 because
Mr. Postman was not sponsoring an initiative, but
informed him that he would be welcome to make
a statement opposing the initiative as a SnideanAtTlm’gc. SGA Stun
dent Services Coordinator Priyi Malilt ’06 further clariﬁed this deci-
sion to Mr. Postman in a series of ermails on Nov. 6.

During dinner on the night of Nov. 7, Mr. Postman stood outside
of (Luad distributing ﬂiers. His handouts accused SCIPE of silencing
his voice and that of the opposition to the Coke boycott initiative.
Mr. Postman's ﬂiers also asserted that SCIPE would not allow anyone
from the opposition to present their views at the open forum.

SCIPE and SGA Cabinet did not silence Mr. Postman. As any—
one at the open forum can conﬁrm, he had the same privileges as

Manipulating the data

' Jim Sumner claims that Grinnell College is not dishonest in
how it presents data. A cursory look at collegeboardcom indi»
cates otherwise.

The College Board collects and presems standardized test
score data. According to the data the college submitted, 50 per
cent of Grinnell students submitted SAT scores and 39 percent
submitted ACT scores. So absolutely no one took both the SAT
and the ACT? Unlikely Carleton College reported 80 percent
of students submitted SAT scores and 55 percent submitted ACT
scores. Oberlin College reported 89 percent and 32 percent. Emr
ory University reported 95 percent and 30 percent. Yale Univer-
sity reported 96 percent and 20 percent.

Of all the colleges I’ve checked so for, not one reported subs
mission percentages that add u to 100 percent. In fact, any in—
stitution that requires either e SAT or the ACT will almost
certainly have a few applicants who submit both SAT and ACT
scores. Grinnell college requires either the SAT or ACT for vir-
tually all applicants.

The fact that Grinnell’s data adds up to nearly 100 percent
strongly suggests that the college has chosen to select the stronger
ofa student's ACT and SAT scores and drop the poorer score
from consideration as a “submitted score.” Such a deﬁnition is not
consistent with the consensus interpretation of ”submitted score."

or questions. During the time allotted for discus-
sion of the Coke boycott initiative, Mr. Postman
and other snidcnrs opposed were recognized
several times and made statements opposing the
boycott. He had ample and extensive opportunity
to speak, as did all the other audience members.
Because of the concerns we’ve heard from students, we felt it necr
essary to clarify the timeline of events leading up to the open fonim as
well as to counter misconceptions about what acmally occurred at the
event. Please feel free to contact SCIPE’s eccleaders or SGA Cabinet
members if you have further questions or concerns.

“Salad" petition misleading

Recently, a petition was created to ensuie that the Student Pub—
lications and Radio Committee (SPARC) would adequately fund
“The Salad,"a magazine dealing with multicultural issues, to publish
two articles next semester. In the petition, it is stated that “The Salad"
ls severely under-funded this semester. SI’ARC would like to refute
this statement in rliatwe came to this budget in agreement with the
editors of“The Salad " And we approved the budget in a manner suite
able for a new publication. It is unfair for them to say that they are
underfunded when no requests for extra funding were made.

SPARC allocated “The Salad" sufficient money to print an issue
due to the fact that “The Salad" originally proposed a budget for only
one issue this semester. It is also unfair to compare the budgets of
individual publications due to the diffeient nature of each publica-
tion.

SPARC was impressed with “The Salad"'s ﬁrst issue and hopes
to be able to fund it adeq tely next semester, but we have not yet
started our budget application process. SPARC would like to ex-
press its frustration with the manner in which “The Salad” voiced its
initial complaint; we hope that, in the funire, publications will talk
to SPARC dArectly before expressing previously unarticulated grieve
ances concerning their publications.

If there are auy questions concerning the issue of SPARC fund-
ing, please send us an oernail at .rpntr@ginnie//,adn.

Unwarranted
sensationalism

As someone who has worked for over a decade
to help establish Japanese snidies At Grinnell, 1 was
tnily dismayed to see the dire and totally inaccur
rate headline (“Twoethirds of Japanese faculty cut
for next year") on page three of the Nov. 11 issue.
Indeed, die accompanying article, full of strange
syntax and false and misleading information, makes
no justification for such sensationalism. The staff
editorial on page nine repeao the uninformed ni-
mors of cuts and faculty “leaving without replace-
ments." While I can only assume that these were
wellrintentioned calls for wider campus debate on
the college's curricular offerings, 1 do not believe
that lazy and inﬂammatory reporting or commen-
tary will add a useful voice or perspective as the den
liberaiivc process unfolds.

Rather than try to correct all of the mistakes
and inaccuracies in the article or the editorial, 1
will statesimply and clearly that no positions in
the Department ofChinese and Japanese (note the
correct name of the department) have been “cut”
for next year.

While one position remains dependent on
temporary funding, staﬂing decisions for next year
and beyond have not yet been made. At the same
time, the fact that staffing of the Japanese program
includes both tenurertraek and norrtcnuxe crack
positions has nothing to do with whether Japanese
language and culture classes will be 0cher next
year. (For the record, they will.)

The reason that a major in Japanese has not
been instituted is simple and
honorable: it would be irres on- ' '
sible for the college to prolr’nisc_ " [MOM/”0m
students a curricular option that in the Deparlmenl

could not at this point be guarr 0f(hinese and
anteed.

still, the option of an inde- Japanese. .have

tour— -year plan utilizing course—
work both in and outside the department that ful-
fills reasonable requirements for a major in Japanese
studies. There have been and are now underway a
number of such independent majors.

The Japanese program at Grinnell is not simply
a “language sequence," and it is equally untrue that
“there are no permanent non-language classes” that
could be applied to an independent major, Prof.
Andrew Hsieh andl have both been teaching regu-
lar courses on Japan for years and there has been a
steady steam of literature and culture classes of
fered by the Department of Chinese and Japanese
for years as well.

A number of different scenarios for the future
ofJapanese studies at Grinnell are still on the table
and students do have a legitimate stake in the out-
come of these deliberations. But snide and argu-
ably racist allusions to the relan’onship between
the Chinese and Japanese programs on campus,
or to the relative “importance” of various foreign
languages being taught at Grinnell, serve only to
hurt feelings and distract attenu'on from the real
issues that need to be debated openly and respects
fully. I call on everyone who is seriously interested
in participating in that debate to take a deep breath,
get informed and then ,oin us in the responsible
discussions that are underway.
