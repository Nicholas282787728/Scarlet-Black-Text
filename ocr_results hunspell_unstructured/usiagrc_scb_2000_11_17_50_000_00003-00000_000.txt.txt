Gooncr noted that several dances have already taken place in

“We have to do something for our youth,"

The building, though “peaceful and beautiful~you wouldn’t know

Election
vandelism
discussed

Election, cent. from p. 2

The deﬁnition ol“h:tc crime” was debated. One
student felt rharcompnringTuesday night’s incidenn to
the hate crimes throughout history was degrading to
these more drastic instances. Another term brought up
was “bins—motivated incident" While the lines between
the two definitions aresomctrhtr hazy, “hate crime" is a
rorirruscd in lowa law, and would thus only be applic
cable to criminal actions taken on the night ofNov. 7.
Ofrciisive posters could possibly fall under the definir
tion orbits-motivated incident." However, this issue
remained unmolved.

Andersons thirtl question, regarding whether some
views should be silenced in the interest or safety and
respect for others, was the source of most of the dis.
course. Some students thought that tactics such as the
use of the swastika were simply “political hyperbole"
that had been misinterpreted into something that could
be censored. They emphasized that the offensivoneso of
the view expressed should not dictate its legality, since
free speech will necessarily result In occasionally ofﬁn-
sive speech. one strident also cited the “Diversity II”
document, which said, in part, “In an amdemit institu-
tion, we generally resolve doubts in favor oifree speech
and expression even if it sometimm lends to discomfort
and anger."

However othersrudene emphasized that such post.
ers changed the environment for some members ofrhe
community in away that made them feel unsafe. Thus,
they emphasiud the difference between “offensive" mt:-
ments and "threatening" statements and felt that the
latter should not be tolerated.

AnoLher aspect of the debate centered on the mo
nymity ofrhe posters. While one student argued that
leaving the posters unsigned constituted forfeiting the
right to free speech, others emphasized the importance
of anonymous free speech, especially in environments
that may be hostile to the point of view expressed.

several students were inrsriated by the diiriculty of
having an open discourse with the anonymous writers.
Also, many sensed drar the incident left students so
polarized over the incident and the issues it provoked
that discussion was made more diniculr. To counter
this argument was the fact that the panel discussion hap
pened at all. one student expressed gratitude that so
many students with opposing views could discuss them
reasonably

A point that most seemed to agree on was the desire
not to involve the administration in any declslons that
would be made One student commented [hill looking
to authorities to regulate speech could only end nega—
tively. Parricipanrs in the panel were urged to rake the
initiative to lcr individuals know when their behavior
was oftensive. it also seemed to be a general consensus
that the criminal vandalism that took place could not
be condoned or protected as air appropriate display of
free speech.

Students 90 to HagUe for conference

by Laura Polstein
Staff Writer

When 1 ask Matt Ewing, 02, how he got interested in envi-
ronmentalism, his response is: “gota hundred blank pigs there?"
ldon’t, in Fact, so he tells me the shortversion which begins about
one and halfycars ago here at Grinnell, and culminatm (for now)
in his pending attendance orthe next round ofUN global warlnc
ing negotiations at the Hague.

Ellen Gallagher ‘03. Vanessa Pierce ‘02, and Brad Orernlnnd
’02, will also be spending’l'hanksgiving break in the Nk’tlmrldmls
as part ofa Greenpeace sponsored student group. The four stu-
dents, all devoted JCIlVlSU and members of Free The Planet, are
thrilled io have this opportunity. They applied and were chosen.
along with 221 other collegesrudenrs, from a pool of 1200.

The negotiations are considered to be the last stage in tho
Clinton/Gore environmental legacy. The issue at hand is the Kyoto
Protocol, which was drafted in 1997, and the final touches that it
needs to make it ready for ratification. Them ﬁnal touches are
clauses which will lay out mechanisms to make sure that corpora.
rions slip carbon emissions through its loopholes. “our goal,”
Pierce said, “is to lobby for provisions whidi prevent corporate
loopholes,"

The srudenr group, who are considered official participants
otrhe conference, is concerned with assuring that the U.S. nego.
tiating delegation is responsible to the American people and not
the American corporations. Corporate inreresr groups are also

going as lobbyists. and there is no doubt, as Brad said, that “there
will be more of them than us." But all four students do seem to
feel dint they can make a difference. There are many kinks to
work out in the Protocol, and thus lors of places that can be ﬁne
tuned to ﬁt environmental interests.

Most environmentalists want to make sure that clauses which
would allow nuclear power to bcseen as a viable solution to glo.
bai warming are eliminated, or at least written carcinlly. This so»
lution, nicknamed “chernobl: mechanism" by the activists. is be.
ing pushcd by the us probably because it would allow corpora.
rions to get “credm” ror selling nuclear technology to developing
nations. The reason that nuclear power enters into this discussion
at all is that the harnessing ofit does not emit carbon dioxide,
Tht vast majority orscienrists afi‘irm thatwhen “greenhouse gases"
such as carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere, the glor
bai climate undergoes changes which will eventually contribute
to overall “warming."

The unitedstares is pivotal in the development and signing
ofan international treaty concerning these matters, not only be
cause American corporations produce 55 percent of fossil fuel
emission, but because our government has more resources to es.
tablish and enforce regulations, than say, Bangladesh.

Tire Clinton/Gore administration advocates an approach to
climate control that favors carbonseoucstration enormously cor.
bon sequestration is defined as airy process that takes mrbon die
oxide out of the atmosphere, absorbing it into some sort oisinit.

Growing forests are often large sinks, and the us wishes to [es
eeive "credits: for each oi its large forests. An "emission credit" is
a concept within the Kyoto protocol that allows a country to emit
new greenhouse gases each time they take a measure to eliminate
the existing ones. According to Gallagher, if the us were to rec
ceive credits forail ofirs forests, it would undermine the objective
orrhe Protocol becruse the forests could be cut down after the
credit is granted. Lobbying tor elimination oithis loophole is one
orthe Greenpeace sponsored groups main goals.

The studeno will be thrilled ifrhe Protocol is completed with
their interests in mind. “But then comes the next hurdle," Brad
reminds me, “the us senate," The Kyoto Protocol is an interna.
tional treaty and thus must be ratiﬁed by a two thirds malority in
the senate. All ioursrudenrs believe that the maiority ofrhe Amati»
our public supports the goals of the Plotoool, because it is “the
common sense solution." But there are many senators with ries
to the oil industry who very well may vote against it.

In Europe, the treaty, and environmental issues in general,
have more support from the ruling elite, Some nations have even
ratified the Kyoto Protocol prior to the Hague conference. All or
the developed countries and many developing ones will have del»
egations ar the UN negotiations. in addition, thousands ofsrn.
done from Europe. Africa. Asia and South Arncrii: will be joine
ing Ellen, Vanessa, Mart and Brad in lobbying for a viable solu.
tion to global warming.
