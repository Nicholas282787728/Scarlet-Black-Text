, The American Legion Rumor

The recent rumors that the American Legion is invesr
tigating Grinnell college because of communist activities
on campus have by now, we hope, been “squelched.”

Students should know that the rumors were based, as
are most such rumors, upon nothing but hearsay from one
or two persons. There is absolutely no truth in the state-
lrents.

 

 

 

Our only hope is that the rumors were stopped before
_ ley did some permanent harm to the college or to the
students. Grinnellians take pride ill their freedom of ex—
’ ssion and their right to consider all sides to every ques-
tion. However, rllmors such as the ones circulated this
Meek c ,lead to very unpleasant incidents which can be
blown iii to such magnitude as to seriously endanger our
freedoms of expression and study.

Theseacademic freedoms must be guarded as the keys
to truth and progressive action. Rumors and llntruths can
lead to misunderstandings which can lead very directly
to the suppression of those freedoms.

~. Identification Cards:

We bring to the "attention of the students and the
deans of the two campuses a recommendation passed by
Sludent Council that all‘ students be given identification
c: (is. ‘

These cards should include, besides the usual informa-
tion, the fact that the student is from Grinnell college.

Besides the college identification, the cards should also
carry a picture of<the student. Age should not be a ques—
tion. '

Those identification cards are needed for the purpose
of cashing checks, gaining admittance to certain events
and taking advantage of special student prices offered by
some hotels and theaters. Many students do not have
drii‘er’s licenses, and those who do often find that mer-
chants will not accept the licenses as adequate identiii a-
im in cashing checks. ‘

There is, of course, a question of expense involved.
While we feel that it is the responsibility of the college to
furnish these identification cards, we would also accept the
possibility that they wollld be financed through“ student

fees.

The little extra that would be charged would be justi-
fied, and we believe that a great majority of the students
would gladly pay a little. extra for tile conveniences offered
by an official identification card.

Though the caption ill the Cyclone may well have been
printed without ill intent, it seemed. nevertheless, a poor
example of good judgment and a Yer) g'ood' example of
poor taste. V

Without even mentioning- the matter of an attempt to
pass ol'l' some real signs of student individualism on this
campus as lunacy, we might onl suggest {to the Cyclone
