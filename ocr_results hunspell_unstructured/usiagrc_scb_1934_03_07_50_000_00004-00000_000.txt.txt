Three Butler players and two
players each from Creighton and
Grinnell were given places on first
and second team selections for all-
Misscuri valley honors by J, C.
Triiesdale, Grinnell cage coach. and
The Scarlet and Black sports staff,

Dams, Butler for-ward who became
ineligible the second semester, was
not mentioned for Valley honors be
cause of this, but, never-thless, was
one of the outstanding for-wards in
the conference. .

Band was the outstanding guard of
the conference and one of the high—
est scorers, while Santi, because of
his scoring ability and superior dee
tensiue work, is given the edge over
Wade and Martinton‘r.

Although Dcmmary outplayed
Schmidt in the Butler-Creighton
games, the latter looked best against
Crinncll and improved grcatly dur-
ing the season. The tall Creighton lad
developed an eye for the basket which
made him one of the best Valley cen-
ters in recent years.

Englebretsen and Batts, although
both sophomores, bother-ed Crinnell
the most because of their height and
their ability to drive through for
setup shots. Dick Mason of Grinnell
was one of the fastest breaking for--
wards in the league and displayed
streaks of high scor g power.
