Sell Freshmen
Chapel Seats

When “city slickel's” sold an Oil»
lahoma man the San Fransisco
bridge last year, such action was
considered really high class con-
fidencc work. But when Everett
Shoots, inspired by James Miles.
sold two Clark preps semester
tickets for chapel seatsithat was
a recotdrshdtteting performance.

Whether Shoots and Miles ac-
quil'ed their persuasive tongues
due to instruction in college ecav
nomics, or whether such gifts are
of divine inspiration matters lit—
tleithe fact remains that: Shel-
don Stevens and Robert Merrill
are now in solo posscssion of two
pinc seats, partly varnished, in
Herrick chapel, and minus one
buck which is now on exhibition
at Clark clubroom.

In tune with the times, talk of
fifth column assistance is seeping
through the dorms. Reynolds Nor-
ton, a prep with prurWillkie, “free
enterprise" instincts, is said to
have had a hand in the transac—
tion, acting as a “shill" for Shoots
and Miles.
