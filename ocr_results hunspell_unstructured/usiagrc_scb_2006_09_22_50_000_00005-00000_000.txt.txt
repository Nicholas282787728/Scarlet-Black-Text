Space in Campus' Center basement not yet filled

Students and administrators are considering a campus pub, but nothing will be decided for at least a year

av SARAH PIERCE AND KEVIN MARCOU

Even aftci the last constiuctioii workers have vacated
the new Joseph F. Rosenneld ’25 Campus Center in thc r X!
mnnrh, the massive building wont be done yet. And this isn't
worrying admnnsrrntors.

A large space was left vacant in the basement of the cam
pus Center to allow for later CXpdnsmn. Vice President for stu»
dent Services Tom Crady and a commirtce including students
will be deciding how to fill the space over the ncxt year. one
prominent idea is to put a campus pub there

“We aren’t going to do anything with it for a year" said
crady. “VV: think it is important that we live in the building
for awhile and see how it's being used."

Part or Crady’s reasoning is the shape of the space itself
“It's kind otun odd space" Crady said. “It is broken up into
settions.Therc is some shcll space that we put down there so
we would have an opportunity to have some expansion space at
one point. But it is not as big as people think it is."

Cmdy hopes to discuss the pub idea with SGA President
Chris Hall ’07 and a committee consisting otsnidents, faculty,
statrand dining services employees. However, President Rus-
sell l<. Osgood would have the final say after the committee
would come to an agreement.

Hall said he is in support orthe pub idea so long as it come
eides with student opinionsﬁThe biggest issue to. me is male

mg sure that student input is the chief proponent of whatever
that space is used foif'sliitl Hail.

Hall said many students see a campus pub as a polcnlml
way to bring students togetller,“1 would be interested in having
it be it social htlb."s:\id Hall, “I think it would be a nice replace-
ment for some orthe things that the Forum has lost."

Crady said several obstacles are in the pub. vay.“Thc issues
are legal issues, and looking at ways to try to do it in a way that
will be appropriate for the eollege,"said Cindy.

Hall agreed. "Thcic are alwliys going to be issues from the
student affairs side—making suie that kids don't get drunk as
hell and having it be a liability issue on the college’s shout
ders," _

In order to deal with these problems before they start, Crndy
wants his future committee to examine the successes and fail-
ures of pubs on other college cornpuses. “What I want to do
is find out what is going on at other campuses, and how their
pubs are working," said Cradyi “At most campuses it has been
successrul fol students drinking responsibly."

one orGruinelrs peer institutions, Carleton College, has a
pub on campus. Aaton Weiner, a current University ofVirginia
Law student and brother of Becca Weiner '08. graduated from
Carleton College lastjune. While at Carleton he often enjoyed
the campus pub.The cave.

“[Thc cave] was a pretty chill place,"said weiner, "It was a

cool place to hang out."

The Cave is an entirely studcntrrun establishment that int
eludes a student venue {or nightly performances. Due to alco
hol restrictions, the pub does not serve any hard alcohol and all
bccis served are at or below 3 2 peiccnt alcohol content.These
restrictions not only keep vandalism and rowdincss atThe Cave
very low, Weiner said, but they also ensure that students over 21
continue to go to local bars in order to ﬁnd a wider selection.
The Cave also serves food, allowing students under the age of
21 to enjoy the pub,

“The point wasnt to go to the cave and get tore up," said
weinet. “The Cave was a nice place for mired groups."

limbo Sadlcl‘t'l'anzosch '88, owner ofJimbo’s pizza and the
Down Undci Pub in town, doesn't think that a campus pub
would affect his business. He believes that an ontcampus pub
would create an environmcntwith more police that wouldn’t be
attractive to student drinkers.

“As a licensed beer establishment, the police will be able to
come in anytime and check tor underage drinking,”said sudler-
Tanzosch, “We get checked once or twice a day. Essentiallyr
think it'll create a bigger police presence on campus."

Hall remains optimistic l-iowcvcr: “As long as people voice
thcir ideas and are willing to bargain and agree to disagree along
the process ofcreating whatever it is,I think it could be a huge
success and something that could be fun for students.”

Out Takes hours extended after student feedback

plans “didn’t make a whole lot orscnse," but the design was
now out oftheir hands.

Even though the attempts last year to preserve Grab &Go
proved frustrating for students involved, student involvement
in shaping dining in the Campus Center isn't over. Dining
Services recently announced that Out Takes hours would be
extended from 11:30 am, the previous, criticized closing time,
to 12:30 pm. Other changes may he ahead as students continue
