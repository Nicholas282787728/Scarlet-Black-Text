Ritwlius iniornied the convention
members, “that the Associated Press
has no point oi view because it has

that the iorward step or the press is
taking steps toward handling more
detail in its human interest stories.
“There is the necessity oi getting

-friend...

Prince Albert

WHEN my father was in college, “Put that in
your pipe and smoke it!” was considered snappy
conversation. I’m ready to take this old line
literally when the talk centers around Prince
Albert. Because P. A. makes two of what I
like in a pipe.

All wise-cracking aside, P. A. is the money
when it comes to deep-down satisfaction in i
smoke. It’s got everything! Cool as the trail
of the ice-man across the kitchen. Sweet as
vacation.‘ Fragrant as a pine forest.

Think up your own similes. You’ll write them
all in the column bedded “Superlative Degree”
when you learn the joys of a jimmy-pipe and
Prince Albert. If you don’t know this grand old
smoke, come around to my room and I’ll give
you a load.
