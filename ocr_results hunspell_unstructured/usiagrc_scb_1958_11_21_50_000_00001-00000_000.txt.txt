Faculty Institutes 2.5 Grade;
Beckﬁeld Posiﬁon Approves Next Year's Calendar

The institution of a new grade of 2.5, the elimination of
the requirement that two hour exams be given each Semes-
ter in each course, next year’s academic calendar and a. re—
vision ol’ the catalog statement on independent‘study for
honors were the topics considered in the Monday faculty

meeting which followed two
day and Sunday.

The institution of a grade of
c-pius, to carry a grade point
of 2.5 was considered last spring
with a 3.5 proposal also being
considered. Both motions were
then defeated. Monday, with
the reconunendation of President
Howard E. Bowen and the ex-
ecutive council, the faculty
adopted the 2.

Another executive council
recommendation, to eliminate
the requirement that ”a min-
imum of two written hour
examinations he held in each
course approximately equally
distributed through the sem-
ester," was also acted upon
and the requirement was elim»
inated,

From the Committee on Ac»
ademic Standing came two pro
posed calendars for the first
semester of the next academic
year. The one proposal for the
second semester was passed.

The Iaculty approved a cal-
endar i which new student
days will begin on Sept. 14 and
last until Sept. 17. The first
meeting of classes will be on
Sept. 13. Mid-semester grades
will fall due on Nov. 7. Thanks-
giving recess will be on Nov.
26, and Christmas vacation will
extend from Dec. 12 to Jan. 6.

An innovation lies in the
new review and examination
period, Jan. 20 through 29.
Jan, 20, 22, 28 and 28 will be
review days, while examina-
tions will be held on Jan. 21,
23, 25, 27 and 29, allowing a
day of study between exam

called meetings last Wednes-

days.

The defeated proposal had
provided for a Thanksgiving re-
cess from Nov. 26 to Nov. 30
and a Christmas vacation'to be-
gin on Dec. 19 and end on Jan.
11. Among the factors considv
ered in defeating this proposal,
according to R. Homer Norton,
dean of the college, was the be-
lief that moving Christmas var
cation back to the 19th would
make it difficult for students to
get vacation jobs.

The approved second sem-
ester calendar sets the first
meeting of classes on Feb. 1.
A Leap Year recess will be
held on Monday, Feb. 29 and
spring recess will extend from
Mar. 24 through Apr. 4. The
review and examination per-
iod will be from May 23
through June 1 with May 23,
25, 27 and 31 as review days
and May 24, 26, 28, 30 and
June 1 as exam days. Corn»
mencement exercises for the
class of 1960 will he held on
June 5.

The catalog statement on in-
dependcnt study for honors has
been revised to state that can»
didacy must he decided before
the end of the first semester of
the j‘unior year and the project
must he presented to the Com-
mittee on Library, Honors, and
Awards before May 1 on a form
available from the office of the
dean of the college. Under cer—
tain circumstances, the commit~
tee will consider applications
after the May 1 deadline.
