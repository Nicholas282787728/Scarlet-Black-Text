The concert given by the Grinucll
College Baud, under the leadership of
Prof. H. 0. Hichernell in Herrick char

' pel Saturday night, was one that ranks

on it level with, I! not higher than, any
other band concert ever given on the
Gl‘Innell campus.

The program was featured by “The
Star Spangled Banner" as the last
number, when the audience was
brought instantly [0 its feet During
this number a large American flag
was raised directly behind the band,
and was glceted by continued aD’
p1ause.’1§he audience remained stande
in: dining the entile selection and
even hesnated to leave at the close.

Program is messing.

The program, which was divided in-
to two parts, was pleasingly varied.
The appreciation of the hearers was
shown _h) the fact that due to the

' many enemies nearly twice as long a

concert was given as was scheduled.
Every number added increased enthu—
siasm. "Selections from Princess Pat"
were exceedingly Well received. With
this. especially, as with the whole con»
cert it was so seed that it was too
short. The “Humorous Chinese War
liar-ch" by Tcngey will be remembered
by the excellent work a! the drums.
In this number the entire band laid
nsidc their instruments and sang to-
gether as a Chinese chorus.

the services of Ralph Mncrhead, eye

STUDIﬂ BLUE PLANS Tl]
GIVE ORIGINAL PLAYS

“The Primrose d “The Gypsies Pass
B)" Are New CI'OI'IIIQIIS‘B ssie
Hatﬁeld and Laura Riclh
son Arc Dramatists.

This is the winning story in the
news story contest announced [0‘
day—The Editor.

By Mabel Will "

“The Primrose" and 'Thc Gypsies
Pass By" are two original one-act

time during the next month. according
to a decision made at the club meet-
ing Tuesday evening. Although in the
past the work or the organization has
been along the line or the study or
literature. and not in its production,
an active program has been planned
for the remainder ci this year.

Both 01 the plays to be given have
been written by Studio members; “The
Primrose” by Bessie Hatfield, '19, and
“The Gypsies Pass By" by Laura Belle
Richardson, '15. The rirst sketch is a
dainty, poetical fantasy which repre-
sents a tlower garden romance. The
latter is a clever little comedy or Ens
lish country lire,

Music tor the songs in "The Prime
rose" has been composed by Lorna

Palmer, ’17. Fancirul and elaborate
costumes and stage settings are being
designed by club members. The casts
for the plays have been chosen as far
as possible from the club. Rehearsals
are being conducted under the direc-
tion» at Mr. Tocley.

As another part of the new program
arrangements have been made with the
staff of the Grinnell Magazine that the
last issue for this year be made up
entirely of contributions from Studio
members. The cover and all illustra-
tions will be designed by club mem-
her: also. Plans for the magazine are
already nearing completion.
