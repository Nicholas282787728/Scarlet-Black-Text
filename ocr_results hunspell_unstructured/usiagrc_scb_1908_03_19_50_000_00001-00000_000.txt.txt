SIMPSON EASUA’ DEFFATED.

-t and snappy Game Monday Ere.
ning Results In Ileieat tor the
Methodists, shin , do to 1st.

Beiore a large and enthusiastic
crowd or supporters the Simpson team
was deteated Monday night in a hard
fought contest by a scorc of d; to 19.
Although the rictory was complete
train the standpoint oi the score, yet
it does not indicate the real struggle
oi the game and'the hard and snapn
right put up by the llotliodists.

Early in the i halt the t. incll
rooters clearly saw that Simpson had
a test team and the score was kept
nearly equal by alternate baskets uni
til well toward the middle or the hall
when the Scarlet and ‘Black machine
got into good running order and born
this tilhe on there was no doubt as to
the dual outcome,

Fro nithc standpoint ot tast ball the
game was rather disappointing and
the ragged work or Grillnell coupled
with the iulnbling ot Simpson and
their apparent surprise at the rigor-
ous style oi play used by the crinnell
me“, made “)8 game slow at times.
The Simpson men were in the play
at all times and passed the ball at
curateli, but they eoultl not locate
the basket, although Bill-(er matte two
long shots iioiu held. They probably
soll'etl (lrinnell's style oi play as hell
as any team that has lllaletl on the
home tloor.

Baker at center prorcd a iorinida‘ble
antagonist tor zieglcr and the knock-
oit honors were even, but thc h'
Gl'lllllell centeruas at his best in the
basket cagiug business and secured
sin throws L'arnt- ioi- Grimiell was
at his best and threw baskets \\ th
apparent ease. making sevcu during
the game.

The work or llaclsacliron and lie-
cart at gua was oi the ‘nal
standard and contiibuted chioily to
keeping down sinii on's score, as the
Methodists were su’tccssiul at sccur-
ing points when an open oppoi-tuni ,'
allowed ,

The dual game will be played at
Des \lohies Friday cloning, and a last
contest will result.
