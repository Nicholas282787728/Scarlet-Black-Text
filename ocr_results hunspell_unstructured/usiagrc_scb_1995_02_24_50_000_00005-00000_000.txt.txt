Cult classic talk
show is about
host, not freaks

By RHYS JONES

Arts Columnist

MONG the vttst constel-
lation of talk show hosts
spread out across the

channels and time slots,ancw star
has quietly entered and is begin-
ning to shine brightly in college
lounges and dormitory rooms ev-
erywhere. His name is Jcrry
springer, and he hosts an epony-
mous, syndicated show, locally
shown from 1:00 to 2:00 ZI in. on
Channel 13 (NBC)

Though his llmeslol ranks
atnong the worst posSible (second

traeted a large and loyal following
among the coveted iii-24 year age
bracket and is known for Its ble
Lailc, lrcakish, and often merely
irrelevant topics.

Wlial makes Jerry Springer so
fascinating to the Generation

I caught up with Meredith
Hanson and Adam Beiers Wednes-
day, February 8th in Cleveland
Hall. There, for the lastyear, they
have regularly watched Jerry
Springer’s show Like many
“Springerites” (as they call them-
selves), they have developed a re
lationship with Jerry, coming to
know many of his guests by name,
and carefully noting similarities
and motifs among the episodes.

Drum Cilclcs have become very

“This is the kind ofnlusic we can

claves, cow bell and shakeres. He
noted that generally the students who
start out with drum circle get inter
ested in one particular instrument and
then go on to take private lessons in
that instrument.

Dorr stresses that the drum circle
is the interaction of dtirerenr people
and rhythms. Inﬂuences from Latin,
African and Eastern music are all com-

bined into one big collage ofsound,
he said. The drum circle itself IS
people interacting with each other.

“ It’s people playing as a com-
munity. That‘s what drum circle

for this week.

lfyou have seen Red Rock Wes!
you have a good idea of what this

ﬁlm is going to be like with the
possible exception of a darker and»
ing. This is the story of a woman
without conscience (Bridget) and a
man without thought (Mike). The
story begins with Bridget stealing
$700,000 from her husband and at-
tempting to run from New York to
Chicago,butsheendsupsomcwhcrc

vincing him to kill her husband, who
is hot on her trail and wanting her

tually coalesces and becomes the
rail guy for all oiurtdgers evil do-

This movie seemed very two-
dimensional to me. Bridgctwascvil
williout any real motive and Mike
was the local ignorant With a sort of
halfrhcarted dream of finding the
big time world. They didn't in-
terest me at all The acting was
decent but not enough to save
these characters The plot was
semirinterestlllg, and the direct-
ing was non-noticeable. Iwould
recommend this movie to fill a
leisurely two hours, but C0n5|dr
ering you would have to go to
DesMoines to see it, don’t bother,
The bottom line: a very plain,
ordinary movie.

A Soldier’s Story

This is the story of a black ofﬁcer
sent to investigate the murder of a
black sergeant in the deep south
during WWII. A very interesting
examination of the racial tensions
presentinthemilitary ofthe1940'sv
it was also a ﬁne mystery, Kind of
AFew Good Meneesque. Ouronly
reservation was that it moves a
little slow and has too many ﬂash-
backs, but nevertheless we really
enjoyed it.

Sirens

If we were base and shallow, we
would say we liked this movie he
cause it has lots of naked people in
it. But we’re not. Really. A young
priest (Hugh Grant) travels to the
idyllic estate ofacontroversial one
ist whose paintings are found ob-
scene by the church. Most of the
picture focuses on the awakening
sensuality of the priest’s wife. A
provocative ﬁlm ﬁlled with sexual
imagery, we reallylikedit. . . plus
it has lots of naked people in it!
North Lounge: Friday at8.‘30p,m

Red Rock West

We were pleasantly surprised by
this one. Nicolas Cage and Dennis
Hopper star in this complicated
thriller. Cage plays a down on his
luck drifter whose honest nature
gets him embroiled in a twisted
web ofliesandmurder. This movie
relies heavily on plot twists and
unexpected surprises to carry it.
but they are fairly effective and
overall, we found this to be an
enjoyable watch.
