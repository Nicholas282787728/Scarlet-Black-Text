H.S. students

surprised at
campus hfe

by Joanne Bizek

“You sure can tell this is a liberal school
in the way they [the students and the facul»
ty] act," remarked high school senior
Sheryl Logan, Logan was one of the lnany
students who participated in the Morter
Baordsponsored visitation day for Grins
nell nigh School students on Thursday.
March 3.

The purpose of this day was to provide
an opportunity lor college and high school
students to interact and for the high school
students to learn more about Grlnnell C01.
lege. it was hoped that this interaction
would improve College/town relations.

Insights concerning preconceived no-
tions of Grinnell College were highlighted
in discussion. Brad Goodrich remarked
that just as the college students think all
high school student are troublemakers, so
the high school students only remember
the “weird people" they see downtown.

. “The ones you notice are the ones that
stick out." commented another student.
Goodrich continued, “The small minority
we see and the small minority you see
cause a lot of the notions about boﬂi
groups. Looking around campus, a student
remarked,“There are normal people here',‘

The students seemed surprised at ﬁle
open, relaxed atmosphere of classes. An
unexpected aspect of classes on which
students commented was the attire of the
professors. The expectation had been one
of conservative, more formal dress, and
the students were surprised at the infers
'mality with which professors dressed and
conducted classes. One girl exclaimed,
“The teacher wore bibs to class and sat on
the duk, not in the chair!"

Several of the students were veterans of
last year’s Mortar Board visitation day.
They returned primarily to see if campus
life was any different this year as opposed
to last year. It was stressed that the
students had had fun last year, aldrough
they had been skeptical and unsure of what
to expect. This year they were not so hesi»
tant.

The high school students were placed
with college student guides on the basis of
compatible academic interest. The
members of Mortar Board who matched
the students were mostly successful in
their endeavor, although they couldn’t
guarantee complete satisfaction.

The college guides first took the students
to class, then to Convocation and lunch.
and the day ended with an informal rap
session in Main Lounge. After attending
class, the general consensus was that one
needed to have a background in the class
area in order to fully understand the class
lectures and discussions.

Comments concerning the organization
of the day were all favorable, and the
students emphasized the importance of
learning about college before actually ex-
periencing it firsthand. Attending classes
gave the students the basic idea of what
college is like. Stated one senior. “The idea
of being on campus is so exciting, but rm a
little anxious about attending college
myself."

Perhaps not so surprisingly, the students
mentioned that they didn't particularly en-
joy attending either the classes or Con-
vocation. “Much of the material presented
in class was considerably above the in-
troductory level." stated a college student
guide. “Ldon‘t see how they could grasp
much. In a way it was unfair. The students
I took around looked bored, and I felt per-
sonally responsible."

It was generally agreed that after the
visitation day the student feels much more
at ease with the college students. Most of
the students cited the friendliness of the
college students and professors as one of
the day’s assets, and they expressed in-
tercst in holding a visitation day for col-

' lege students.

Lively discussion marks
faculty meeting

by Catherine lngrassia

The 2,102 course changes for this
semester's class was one of the lively
topics of discussion at the March 14 faculty
meeting . Other topics included the aboli-
tion of ”with distinction" for all freshman
courses including the tutorial, a limimtion
on the number of acceptable summer
school credits and the approval of the
refusal to accept cousework graded below
a C as counting toward the major,

Catherine Frazer began the meeting
with a fifteen minute discussion of the
preregistralion drop/add issue. 2,102
drop/add occurred in the period beginning
after preregistration last fall and ending at
the drop/add deadline (February 14) this
sememster.

The Committee on Academic Standing
expresses i5 concern about the prevalence
of what it terms “the ‘casual shopper' at-
titude" toward course offerings. Frazer
added, that the “Many course changes
take place on the floor of Darby without op-
timal discussion with the advisor.” Also,
the volume of the changa undercut the
hours advisers put in with students at the
time of preregistration.

Opening this discussion, DA. Smith
elaborated on this “casual shopper ate
titide" image with an appropriate quotas
tion from Cardinal John Henry Newman.
Smith emphasized the fact that it is the
faculty themselves “who have created the
shopping center where we serve as con
sumer advocates."

Smith also brought up two other points:
the need to assure "the faculty's corporate
sense of what this institution is about” in
terms of curriculum and the need to
eliminate what they termed “the con-
sumer rwearch at the end of every
semester which allows the students to give
a ‘consumer report’ on the product."

Other faculty members attempted to ex-
plain away the phenomenon by the multi-
ple effect of course changes and the at
titude of “soitpreregistration” held by-
many students. Some professors cited the
lack of curriculum structure as particular-
ly responsible for the occurrence. “What
can you do unless you go back to the struc
ture of requirements?" said James Fudge.

Gerald Lalonde casually suggested the
possibility of charging a course change fee
to help diminish the number of "capriciant
course changes."

Most faculty member were unwilling to
directly address the issues, since rectilyr
ing the problem would require some fun
damenfal changean curriculum. “We

don’t want to change the system just for
the sake of changing it," said Jim Teder-
man.

A motion to abolish “with disctinction”
in the freshman tutorial was carried by a
vote of 3448. Frazer said the Committee on
Academic standing felt, “The prospect of
distinction has little motivational motion
and is not consistent with the concept of
pass/fail grading.“

Some faculty members supported the
use of “with distinction" however. “I like
to have it there to encourage hightly
motivated students” said Liahna Babener.

Many professors expressed the concern
that the tutorial was not regarded as a
legitimate course by freshmen. “A serious
problem with the tutorial continues to be
its status among freshmen as a matter of
the second order" said James Kissane.

The abolition of “with distinction" in all
freshman courses was unanimously ap-
proved. This action was prompted by the
low registration for such work. “But what
is a freshman course in a school that does
not have prerequisites?” pointed out
Lalonde, with a remark he attributed to
Paul Munyon.

The CAS comittee disapproved on sum
mer school credit and procedures. The in»
itial proposal recommened that reduction
of the limit of summer school credits from
nine to six per summer. Babener proposed
a friendly amendment to this motion mak-
ing the maxium number of credits eigh-
teen over three summers with a limit of
nine credits earned in any one summer.
The CAS and the faculty unanimously ap-
proved this amended motion.

Also passed was the Curriculum Com-
mittee’s propposal that a two—credit sums
mer intership, to complement the more ex-
pensive (our and eight-credit intership be
approved by the faculty. Such a measure
would take financial pressure off the stu»
dent since a two-credit intership would
cost “20.

Al Jones questioned the charging of
regular precredit rate for summer inter-
ships." 1 don’t understand why this rate is
in effect. The student is not using the
facilities, the faculty or the campus. I ob-
ject to charging the same semester rate
for summer school credit, let alone inter-
snip credit.”

Frazer countered by set 'ng that the col-
lege is “charging for credibility," and add-
ed that she felt that it was not feasible to
bring up this separate issue at that time.

The rest of the meeting was devoted to
business. . . . v . a .

Accusations,
call for

resi nation

mar
JB meeting

by Jane Knufmnn

”Either stop that kind of politicing or
resign the vice presidency now,” Concerts
Committee Chair Daniel Kaltz suggested
to Haines Hall President, Peter Hautzr
inger. A brief but fiery debate between the
two SGA officials dominated Wednesday
night's Joint Board meeting. ,

Hautzinger brought the problem of the
lack of funding for the Alice In Wonderland
party to JB attention, stating, “Fred
lKlatZ] has informed me that there is no
extra money for a band... i don’t want to
let the party die because we don’t have a
band." He appealed to JB for advice in
handling the situation.

Klatz explained that “traditionally"
SGA has given the Concerts Committee
$600 per all-campus party. This year, SGA
gave $2000 to fund the David Johnasen con-
cert, but no money was allocated to any of
this semester's four allcampus parties.
The Social Committee gave $1000 to the
student coordinator for the waltz, which
further depleted potential concert funding.

“This is the Concert Committee and our
first priority is concerts, no allcampus
parties. I was left without enough money
for a program and something had to be
done. .

Certain individuals have told people I
have mismanaged funds and that I have
acted poorly. Well, Peter, those kinds of
accusations are unnecessary, unqualified
and should not have been made.” Klatz
charged Hautzinger with promising to help
certain individuals obtain next year‘s con-
certs committee chair.

“I have not said anything like that."
Hautzinger responded. ”I don‘t know
where you got mat. I won't even rebuke
that latter comment. I have stated that you
could have manged funds a little better.
I’m trying real hard not to be confronta—
tional.”

“Well on May 7, the date of the Alice par-
ty there will be a band," commented
Klatz. “I got a blues band from Chicago,
Hip Linkchain.” ’

Now I have a problem, but your problem
is solved. 1 think your actions incredibly
dishonest and unethical."

This issue finally wound down without
further incident.

when the issue of the possible policy
change in floor study break funds arose,
SGA vice president Mark Bradshaw
stated, “What the adminsitration wants to
do is come up-with another study of funds.
It won’t eliminate hall activies, but will
bolster floor activities.

“The administration did not agree to
give money to RAs. It’s still in the commit-
tee on Student Life," further explained
SGA Presidnet John Moffet,
