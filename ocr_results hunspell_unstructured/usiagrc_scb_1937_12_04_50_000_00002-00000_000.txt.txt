WHERE WE STAND

"Since the recent appearance in these columns of several
editorials discussing frankly and openly campus issues,
which we felt neededsuch discussion, there has been an
undercurrent of feeling among both students and faculty
that the policy of the Scarlet and Black was one of criti-
cism of all existing institutions.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

We, the editors, are most keenly aware that therenre
on this campus many worthwhile and valuable institutions
without which Grinncll college would not be the college we,
and you, are proud to call our Alma Mater.

We are just as keenly aware that all is not perfect
here. _
At the same time, we have hopes that this college shall
continuously progress toward that illusory goal, perfection.

To that end we offer in the editorial columns, comment
and discussion of conditions which we feel need such treat-
ment.

The function of this paper is obviously not dogmatically
to assert facts we as individuals believe to be true.

It is rather its function, and privilege, to be a morror of
student and faculty opinion and to play a part in guiding
the expression of this opinion.

This opinion will not in all probability ever be unani-
mous, nor on the other hand will our opinions always be
infallible.

That, in itself, is unimportant.

For, in the broadest sense, it is essential to have dise
sension if we are to be saved from slow death by stagnation

If, in these columns, we succeed in creating discussion
on any campus issue, be it the grading system, or the de-
velopment of a recreation center, we have fulfilled part of
our function.

If, as a result of such discussion, an issue is clarified

and, where necessary, amended, our function is finally justl-
fled.

Such is the case at present.

Student opinion, as reflected and clarified in these
columns has aroused the student council to submit to the
curriculum committee a petition asking discussion of the

cut system.

In the last issue of the Scarlet and Black, an editorial
appeared suggesting, on the basis of expressed student and
faculty opinion, that the new grading system was not satis-
factory and needed clarification and possible revision.

The fact that the editorial created such discussion ful-
filled our first function.

Our function now is to clarify and guide student opinion
until the new system is accepted or is modified in a manner
satisfactory to faculty and students alike.

This we shall endeavor to do.

And in so doing we hope, as in every case we hope, to
obtain the unified support of faculty and students working
toward a constantly better Grinnell college.

on important and much needed
legislation, though tax revision,

is up to congress, had not been
considered.

In the House, the question of
reduced appropriations for high-
ways in order to balance the bud-

of building with private capitai,
were of paramount importance,
particularly in view of the pre-

The plea for reduced highway
expenditures had almost immediate
repercussions in Iowa. John D.

protest on the proposal,

other legislation, important to
