BY ANNIKA ENGINEER

As the school year slowly draws LO
an end and May madness sers in,
people srarr needing srress relievers
like mosr smokers need nicotine.

Now, whereas a large maioriry of
srudenrs in Grinnell find tun rhings
to do, even in academic bulldlngs,
some people hunger for somerhlng a
llrrle less made and a lirrle more in
rellecrual. The sad facr ofrlie marrer
rhough, is rhar rhe rown ofcrinnell
has very lirrle to offer in rerms oFthe»
arre and dance; bur Ier it never be sald
rhar Grinnell sr‘udenrs lack rhe oppoh
runiry ro go see a grear srage petfor»
manee.

Trurh be rold, rhe ourlng is actu-
ally made all rhe more easy by rhe facr
diar rhe college purs on five malnsrige
producrlons every year. ofrhese five,
four have already been performed and
she lasr one is scheduled as rake place
on rhe 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th orMay

Tl}: Idiot: Karamazrm is a corn.
edy wrirren by Chrisropher Durang
and Albert lnnauraro, who Curwtotc
rhe play ar Yale in 1974. The play
irself is loosely based on rhe
Dustnycvsky novel The Brat/Jen
Kammmuand even uriliees oneofrhc
well known rranslarors ofoosroyevsky
ln rhe enaermenr. “The play is really

a parody of a whole range of lirera—
rure :lnd lirerary figures," says Jan
Czechnwski, direeror of rhis play,

Furrher, rhe play has arrraered two
guesr designers from Chicago rharwill
be handling borh lighting and scenic
designs.

The eenrral rheme of rhe play is
the narrarion of Consrance Carnerr
who iranslared several lirerary works
in her dine. because ofrhe wide span
other translations and rhe facr rhar
she was very well read, rhe inrerprera.
rions rend re ger mixed up in herhead
and whar rhe audience really hears is
Carnctt’s muddled commenrary.

The easr is comprised ofeighreen
ralenred acrors and rhe play is split
inro rwo aers. The casr has been re—
hearsing approximately ﬁve days a
week for rhe lasr six weeks and prom»
ises ro pur on an enehanring perfote
manee.

There seems ro be a pervasive feel.

almosr roo much fun in purring rhis

Says Clara Rice ‘99, who plays rhe
role of Anais Pnin, “This is rhe sec—
ond producrion oflan's rhar I'vc acred
in, and I really admire his direcring
sryle. He and Tom (assisranr ditcce
tot) are very encouraging and rake

They also have a grear knack for bring-
ing our rhe neurotic intricacies in
Durang’s wriring. This is mylasr pro-
diicrion, and it has been wonderful
ro work with such a ralenrcd group of
people, several of which are close
rriends. After rwo years doing direc.
rorial and technical work, it's nice be.
ing in from ofrhe curtain for one lasr
time."

Carl Long ‘02, who plays Dimitri
Katamazov, commenred that “lacringl
is exciting. I love being onstage. The
rehearsals are rhe highlighr ofi'ny days.

They give me a chance ‘ro rake a break

" from rhesrressful life are Grinnell'
and srep inro rhe world ofa—wcll, a
venus flyrrap, It’s a crazy play. Defi.
nirely a must-see. And you can quote
me on that."

lvan Karamaaov is played by An-
drew FuerstceHenty ‘02, and he
claims rhar he's “never been involved
in a show as nonsensical as neuron
Krmlmtlzrw berore. while in many
ways it’s been hard ro work with lines
rhar just don't make sense, it’s also
been a lor ofrun."

All ihe performances will rake

Li Gmndel/lmim is widely regarded

Which is parricularly remarkable con-
-ldenng diar rhe film acrually conrains
tlo scenes or rrenches, no mud, no

The plor is loosely based on Renoit’s
fetsonal experiences duringWorld War

(interestingfact: lean Sabin, rhe grear
French aeror, wore cholr’s own WWI
uniform in rhe ﬁlm). According ro
Renoir, rhe idea for rhe filrn came from
rhe srory ofhis fellow soldier who had
.scaped from several German pow

In an inrerview for The Nzw rm
mics, Renoir made rhis very inreresr.

The rhree heroes, all played by wellr

Picrte Fresnay), a plebian gear. Cabin),
nd Jew (Marcel Dalio). ln addinon,
Austrian Erich von srroheim (5mm:
linoleum!) is excellent as the German
—ommandanr.

Mosr imporranrly, however, Renoit’s
irecrion is visually very impressive. The
direcrors farher was the Famous painrer

Vilim SCCITIS happy about choos-

cision to bccomc a theatre major. She
tcmcmbets her experiences in clemen-

Set during che Barrle ofverdun, rhe
ﬁlm was made in 1937, at a time when
Hitler was already rebuilding rhe Ger

So whar is rhe grand illusion ofrh
