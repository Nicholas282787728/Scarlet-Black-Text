Empha’rically Speaking - -
By Dean Earl D. Strong

Your editorial “Vacation Days?" in the
issue of March 23 appears to have been
written under the assumption that a vaca-
tion previously provided had been pre-
empted by the faculty for the purpose of
giving tests. The assumption is erroneous.
Vacation was abandoned when the CDT
asked us to do so and has been more than
offset by the earlier date for commence-
ment. The test days take the place of reg»
ular classes, and obviously cannot inter-
fere with a nonexistent vacation.

That some of the examinations are de-
signed to “test the tests” is quite true.
The Grinnell Fine Arts Test and the Grill-
nell Health Test are new this year and have
been used with only a few students. Fur-
ther data are needed to help the sponsors
discover where the tests can be improved.
I told your reporter the facts in the case,
and continue to feel justified for thus op-
enly expressing my confidence that the
Juniors would be glad to contribute a few
hours of their time toward helping a bit
in the development of the Grinnell program
of education.

The reasons why the shortened college
year will not be broken by week-end holi-
days are plain. Grinnell has received gifts
from many donors and is receiving fees
from students, in return for which it must
offer a college education of high quality.
If it recurrently abandons its program and
decrees days of idleness it is not meeting
its obligations

Moreover, gratuitous holidays to meet
some passing whim do not fit into the con-
temporary pattern. The men on Iwo Jima

and in Manila and half-way across Germany
would not be where they are if the generals
had ordered holidays when their troops got
bored or t 'ed. It is to be doubted that the
lives of Grinnell college students are more
strenuous than those of our soldiers and
sailors. The thousand Grinnellians all over
the‘ world might not read with full appre»
ciation an announcement in some future
issue of the Scarlet & Black that the stu-
dents back home had been given two extra
holidays because they had spring fever and
needed something to “raise morale."

Resurrecting An Old Issue - -

Last year the Scarlet & Black printed many
editorials on the question of seniors taking
both comprehensives and course examina-
tions. The senior class seemed to be have
ing a tough time of it making the faculty
understand that comprehensive examina-
tions were no joke—-that time for study and
adequate preparation was vital.

We of the senior class have considered
ourselves quite fortunate this year because
we haven’t had to “gripe” continually about

the’ “comprehensive problem." But perhaps,

we patted ourselves on the back too soon.
A rumor has been fast circulating on cam-
pus that seniors will be excused from class
ses on a Friday noon, and the first comp
is scheduled for the following Saturday
morning. We sincerely hope that this ‘is
not the case. Since the examination sched-
ule has not as yet been made out, perhaps
we still may have a chance to express our
opinion on the matter.

The Grinnell plan of liberal education
terms comprehensives a necessary means
of integrating the years of study in a
major field. These tests cover the work
of courses taken three, in many cases, four
years ago. Preparing for such examinations
is not a simple matter. Concentrated study
is necessary, but the student has not ample
time for preparation while attending class
and participating in campus activities. In
former years seniors havesutilized their
spring vacation for badly needed reviewing,
but this year‘s senior class lacks that op~
portunity. Yet in the days of spring va-
cation seniors were excused from all clas-
ses the week proceeding comprehensives.
If this were formerly thought a necessary
measure, it is surely even more essential
this year.

We aren’t complaining about taking
comprehensive examinations over our major
field of study But if we must take them,
we‘d like the chance to make a worth-while
showing. We, quite evidently, cannot do
our best if such a. limited time as one af-
ternoon is granted us for preparation.
