VARSITY vs NEBRASKA.

Some Nebraska “Darin"AReserVes Play
Marshalirown.

This afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on
Nebraska Field the Iowa College
team will play its lirst hard game or
the season. The team left yesterday
morning at for Lincoln in charge
of Coach Hamilton and Trainer Fishr
er, sixteen strong, in the best possible
spirits and conﬁdent, of putting up a
strong light against the “coinhuslo
ers".

The team will necessarily be severe»
iy crippled by the absence of Camp-
bell from his position at right guard
and by the fact that Peirce at left
guard will hardly be able to play the
whole game but Hurd, Garner or Mc-
Ilrath will make acceptable sub-
stitutes for the line positions. \Vith
the acoeptinns above noted the team
is in excellent condition and capable
of putting up a spirited game,

From Nebrasba’s camp come only
the most conﬁdent statements, In
fact Coach “King” Cole is inclined to
assume a somewhat contemptuous
attitude and to consider the game go.
day as merely a, preliminary to his big
game against Minnesota on Oct. 19th
although he has stated that he has a.
wholesome fear of the Grinnell spirit,

Q. T“.- Elliolt, editor of the Daily
Nebraskan to whom the Scarlet and
Black is indebted (01' the lineup,
weighls, etc, of the Nebraska team
which are published today, is author-
ity for the statement that the Neb-
raska students look upon Grinnell as
one Of the strongest small college
teams in the west and believe that.
the game Saturday will be a good con-
test although they expect to win by a
score of 30 or 35 to 0 which latter
statement most people here are in-
clined to dispute.

Practice the past week has been
very encouraging, the varsity making

good gains repeatedly against the
strong reserve team while Wednesday
night in a practice game with the
high school eight touchdowns were
made in twenty-three minutes. All
these things give hope of a strong
showing against Nebraska today.

The probable lineup and oliicials w-
gather with the weights of the Nebr
raska men follow:
