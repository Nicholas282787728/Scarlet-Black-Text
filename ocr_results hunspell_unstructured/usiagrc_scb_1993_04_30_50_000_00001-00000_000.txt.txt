Youth League member calls
for action in South Africa

By Riva Sharples

 

 

Despite end of apartheid, conditions mostly unchanged
PREADING awareness aboutcurrentconditionsin South Africa,
S both political and social, was the main focus of avisit by Clayton
Lillienscldt, a member of the African National Congress Youth

League. Lillienseldt, a third year studentat the University of Cape Town
in South Africa, spoke to Grinnell students and faculty during the final
leg of a four-month U.S. tour.

Even with the recent abolition of apartheid in 1990, conditions
remain unchanged for many South Africans, according to Lillienseldt.

“Apanheid is still alive for most Nothing has changed." he said.
“Up until 1990, we had legal segregation, like there used to be in this
country with separate drinking fountains, beaches, etc. Apartheid in
South Africa wasa way the govemmentdivided us, which in turn caused
faction lighting. We were sepamted into Colored, Indian, Black, White,
and then funher divided
into tribes, And now,
though the signs may be
gone, things in South Af-
ricaare slowrochangcﬂhe
majority is still treated as
the minority. Domestic servants still call their employers ‘mistress‘ and
‘master.’ People still have to go to the back of the store to buy things."

An ongoing violence plagues the country, said LillienseldL The
recent assassination of Chris Hani has only made tension worse.

“Chris Hani was assassinated when he had just returned from a
national tour of South Africa. On his tour, he spoke about non~violence.
peaceful relations and political tolerance. His assassination has now
increased black and white violence because the Afrikaans (AWP)
movement was implicated in the assassination. Youth are angry. People
are getting killed,“ Lillienseldt said.

Another purpose of the tour was to examine youth exchange
programs in America for possible implementation in South Africa.

Arias attacks Clinton’s aid policy

B Alexandros K.

SCAR Arias, Nobel Peace
0 Prize winner and former

president of Costa Rica, in-
vited Grinnell College students to
work for the good of all humanity
during a speech, on Tuesday night in
Herrick Chapel. entitled “Awaken-
ing to a New World."

In the presence of a large audi-
ence Arias layed out his views re,
garding world stability and how we
ought to achieve it. “We need to
redeﬁne security," Arias said, be—
cause“peacewillnot
come if we think in
terms of military sc-
entity.”

“Work, educa~
Lion, and knowledge
are the rights of all
citizens," claimed
Arias, adding that they should never
be monopolized by the “powerful or
the prosperous."

Arias also warned students
againstfuturetemptations.“Y0u will
be asked to be accomplices in acts
whose success means pain, poverty
and even death for many. The devel-
opment of the world is full of cyni-

cism and hypocrisy," he said.

During a question-answer pe-
riod, the formerpresident made some
directreferences toPresidentClinton.
Arias criticized Clinton’s foreign
policy for being “almost immoral,”
because it directs most of the us.
available foreign aid to a single coun-
try, Russia

“I don’t know what is in his
mind. Ihope in hisnext term—maybe
it will be Hillary’s term~he will
spend more time [concerned with
foreign affairs]," Arias said. He be-
lieves that poverty needs In be dealt
with globally and not locally.

“Presrdent Clinton was wrong when
he said that he’d spend all [his] time
on domestic affairs; that is what the
American people wanted to hear."
—Nobel Peace Prize Winner OscarArias

“If you are elected as the Presi-
dent of a country, you have to under-
stand that to govern is to educate,”
explained Arias, adding that “Prai-
dentClinton was wrong when hesaid
that he’d spend all [his] time on do-
mestic affairs; that is what the Ameri-
can pcople wanted to hear."

Arias pointed out that it is im»

perative to ﬁght poverty in the Third
World. "Borders provide no obstacle
to the spread of poverty," he ex-
plained. He showed how weapons
that may have set sail today from an
industrialized nation to a Third World
country, “will undoubtedly oppress
and impoverish many people, and
could possibly be employed in the
next civil war to endanger national,
regional, or global peace."

Finally Arias expressed h's sup—
port for NAFTA. He explained that
trade agreements between industrial-
ized countries and Third World coun-
tries provide only alternative to mas-
siveemigration.Tradeagreemerttscre—
ate jobs that allow people to sunrive
without being forced to emigrate.

Oscar Arias Sanchez served as
President of CostaRica from 1986 In
1990. He was instrumental in for-mu-
laring the Central American Peace
Plan. which laid the groundwork for
a ceasefire between govemmentand
rebel forces, an amnesty for political
prisoners and free and democratic
elections in Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Hondu-
ras. For his efforts to resolve the
conﬂicts in Central America Arias
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1987.
