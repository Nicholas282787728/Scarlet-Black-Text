tions and customs, and there is ev-
ery reason to expect that the new
members of the college will willingly
cooperate with the upper classmen in

' an effort to establish relations that

will be both amicable ahd helpful for
everyhody concerned.

Many changes have been made in
living conditions since last year and
it hulbeen necessary to crowd up in
some instances, but at the same time
there is a general spirit of good tel—
lowshlp and of optimism. The sys~

back the hours at fellowship that
were lacking last year and altogeth~

next nine months.

In financial matters, too, the future
is rosy. This ycar will see the ﬁnal

On Friday, July ﬁrst, at Hartwick,
there uccll"ed the death of William

class of i923, Will was preaching at
Hartwiek, where he had a student
pastorate, and was devoting his time
to religious work during the 5mm
mer. He was learning to drive 2, car
and in company with a friend, the
owner or the car, was going to town
early on the morning of his death. As
they approached the railroad track
outside of Hartwick the train was
coming and they slowed for it, the
car skidding some distance before
coming to a stop. The two [)‘lesenr
gers thought that they were safe but
the engine just caught the front and
threw the one clear while Will was
caught, crushed between our and en-
gine. He died in the hospital at Belle
Plaine without regaining conscious
ness Funeral services were attended
by many Grinnell people. Memorial
services were also held at Hartwiclr
and in Gl'lnnell that same evening

\ Altho lie was working his way

Those who knew Will were unive

relations with his fellow students and
was trusted by all, as shown by the
honors that came to him, onsought.
Words cannot adequately express the
thoughts of his friends for him, yet
in his room on the day of his death
there hung this message which might
have been expressly written for him.
"To be just and wise. To be brave
and kind, To live every day- in God‘s
favor and every night to find reward
in His approval. To have for friends
