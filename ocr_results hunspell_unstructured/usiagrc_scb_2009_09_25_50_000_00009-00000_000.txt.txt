Not too many nutty traditions disappear from Grinnell,
but when President Osgood leaves at the end of this year, one
particulai tiny, retl, tradition Will be going with him. College
presidents are not usually spotted at five in the morning spoit-
ing ied shortsinot to mention tiny ted shorts. But since oui
institution prides itself on its nutso tiatlitions, this week the
5&3 would like to feature our subtly gong ho RKOv—orl'lsrv
wise known as Russell K. Osgoodiand ask once and for all
WTF is up with RKO's tiny red running shorts?

The tiny red shorts odyssey all started in the year 1965.
“There was this new fad called jogging, and I thought I'd get
some runningshoes and try it out,"said Osgood.“/\itd I kid you
not, the minute I tried it, I loved
in" man

After 12 years or

nor shorts or all. “They're always
the same size has cause they are
bathing suits." Osgood said, before quickly explaining that he
usually goes for a swim after he runs.

“1 have about 15 pairs orbnrhing suits. About halfofthem
are red. I don't know why I have 15," Osgood said. “If you see
me around my house at night, you’ll see me wearing themi
just wear them as shorts, Not just for running purposesiI wear
them when 1 ﬂy on planes."

RKO’s choice ofcolot is really to be more visible to drivers,
and during his izyenrs otrunning on this campus he hasn't had
too many accidents.“1’ve had several dogs try and bite me,"Os-
good said. “it’s always some farm dog who's not used to people
coming by."

Since Osgood rims at 5 a.m., not too many Grinncllians get
the pleasant surprise orspotting him. “I've just seen him once,"
Raghav Malik ’13 said. “He just popped out from between
Spanish house. He just muttered a ‘hi’ and went offin the other
diiection...I didn’t really expect to see him pop out of nowhere
at like five thiity in the morning, but I’d heard about it."

Aftei a late night romp in a computer lab, Najma Osman
’12,:aught a glimpse ofthc president running through the log-
gias. “He’s pretty ﬂt for an old man,"osmnn said.

At the end of this year, Osgood will be returning to his
seacoast hometown where visibility is even less adequate than
‘it is here in the sunny cornfields.With this in mind, he will be
adding a new feature to his attireileﬂecﬁve vests. Grinnellians
and townies alike will most likely miss RKO and his tiny red
shorrsiwait, correction, his tiny red bathing suits.

“It's like a Mountain Dew float”

Marketplace Master Cyril Afeku ’13 likes to let his creative juices flow

Though few students would call Grinnell dining hall cuisine
extraordinary—award winning though it may bbCyiil Afeku
’13 has discovered a way to make it a bit more interesting. Every
day, often at both lunch and dinner, he mixes 2 percent milk with
Mountain Dew,

Although he didn't start drinking the concoction until he
lutived at Grinnell from his home country, Ghana, Afcku cultit
vated an interest in adventurous beverages growing upimixing
togethermrious sodas and regional juices. “1 try to keep in mind
different ﬂavors and how they will taste together," he said.

The philosophy behind the alliteratively alluring soda-dairy
combination is really quite simple. Afeku explained that the caf-
feine from the Mountain Dew gives him energy while the pro-
tein and vitamins in the milk provide nutrition. I found that the
drink does not taste too bad titheriﬁzzy, sweet, and slightly
crcamyisimililr, perhaps, to a melted Mountain Dew ﬂoat. “I
think it's really quite nice,"Afeku said.

The drink has received mixed reviews, “My friend Kamila
really likes it, but, you know, not everyone does," he itl, adding
that another friend thought the combination was disgrnting,

So far, milk and Mountain Dew is Afcku's sole culinaly ClU’
anon, but with Grinnell's wide array ofliquid nﬂcrings, more are

1. Fill a glass 2/3 of the way with
Mountain Dew first to avoid un—

2. Fill up the' rest of the way with
milk of choice.

3. Enjoy!
