The Pioneers certainly had a tull
package this time around. Quality
deiense mixed with hard hitting
enabled Grinnell to post a 241
record in conierence with decisive
victories over Coe and Cornell, 9-4
and 5-2. respectively. Paced by the
resourceiul pitching oi Brad
Sheridan, who chalked up two com-
plete games, the Pioneers
demonstrated that they will be a
force to be reckoned with in the
Southern Division.

Sheridan shut the Kohawks
down, striking out tour while allow
ing only two walks and six hits. Ac-
cording to catcher Randy Seeley,
“Sheridan pitched a very solid ball
game, not allowing anybody past
first base through the iirst rive inn-
ings." Now, that's how you win ball
yma. s

Sheridan was obviously pleased
with his stellar periormance. “I
had good control out there today."
he said “My curve ball was muv»
ing, and i tinally had some zip in
my fastball.” Buthe's by no means
taking all the credit {or the victory;
readily admitting that none at it
would have been possible without
the line defenswe showing (the
Pioneers committed only two err
furs on the afternoon),

didn't 'iuve the same luck, losing a

Sheridan was on fire again mes

The Cornell hitters were continualr

Trackstérs Finish
Fifth and Eighth
at Monmouth

by Katherine Fairbanks

Once again, while most oi us
were lazing around this past Satur-
day, the members or Grinnell's
spring track team were up at the
crack of dawn and on their way to
the ﬁrst meet oi the season, the
Monmouth Relays. The results oi a
day of Competition were an eighth»
place finish [or the women (out oi 14
teams) and a filth-place ﬁnish [or
the men (out of 12 teams).

Although the women may not
have accumulated as many points
as they would have liked, they
were pleased to note that every
woman that ran placed in the top
eight. Some of the good pertur-
mances oi the day included a third-
and a fourthrplace iinish in the
«loom hurdles, by Joanne Sackett
and Trim Campbell. respectively,
and a lourihrplace linish by the
4x200 relay team. in the tleld
events, the highlight for Grinnell-s
women was a secondeplace finish
by Abby Green in the high Jump.
with a jump oi 5'0".

The men's team turned in a
number oi outstanding perior-
mances. particularly in the
distance events. Jonathan Lave

dominated the [warmile during the
indoor season, each won their
events ~ Lave in the 5000m and
Hammond in the steeplechase,
where he iinished an impressive 15
seconds ahead of his closest coma
petitor. Steve Piper also deserves
credit for a good race: he placed
third in the lOOOOm, which

is equal to zolapsaround the track,
In the field events Mark St. Andre
and Dave Jones were the major:
Contributors to the Grinnell score,
st. Andre placed in the long jump
and high jump, with a personal
best oi 6’2" in the high jump. while
Jones scored points in the long
jump and triple jump.

Overall, it was not a bad day. in
light of the [act that it was the first
meet of the season and that
everyone was still sutlering Irom‘
post-break depression. Undoubtedr
ly, now that the Grinnell athletes
are back on their training turf and
under the auspices oi their
coaches, we will see many more
noteworthy performances on the
track.
