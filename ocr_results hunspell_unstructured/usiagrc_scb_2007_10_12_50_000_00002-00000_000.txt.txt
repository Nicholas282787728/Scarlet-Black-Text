Chris Johnston ’09 is lucky enough to work every Sunday
afternoon and Tuesday night inside a giant Candy Land hoard.
To move spaces along the board, all he has to do is call people
on the phone and convince them to give him money.

Unfortunately for him, he doesn’t get to keep it. Johnston
works for Phonathon, where twice a week he calls alumni and
parents in rm attempt to convince them to donate to the Pie—
neer Fund. In the past month, Phonathon callers have already
surpassed their goal for the whole semester, raising $233,000.
This is a new record for Phonathon, which for the entire spring
semester last year raised just $195,000.

For those involved with Phonathon, this

new record is not a surprise. “Our student ’ldon’ilikeIam/irirpeop/e, /

alumni have responded in a very positive

of the Pioneer Fund. “I don't know if we're

doing anything different than we have in the -

past We try to bring the Grinnell experi»

ence into the Phonathon room and try to convey that to the
people were talking to."

Most students have never been into Meats basement, where
Phonathon operates weekday nights and Sunday afternoons.
Because of the nature of the job, working at Phonathon does
not appeal to all students. “I don’t like to solicit people," said
Erin Sindewald ’08. “I don’t even like to order pizza on the
phone."

But those who work there have a ditterent perception. “Pho-
nathon is a great job," said Jeff Sinick ’09, one of the student
managers. “You’re connected to the college,you’re connected to
alumni, you hear crazy stories, it's a lot of fun." It also has a core
group of students who continue to come back, with 19 of last
semester’s 34 employees returning.

supervisors, consciously attempt to make the job as fun as pos-

siblc. Each shift, callers can win prizes for meeting goals, like
gift certiﬁcates for reaching a certain level of donations. The
Candy Land hoard, which wraps around the room, is one game
the callers play, moving on to spaces with corresponding prizes
as they get more and more pledges,

Not only does Phonatl-lon provide good wages—it is one
of the highest paid jobs on campus—but it also creates a link
between current students and alumni. “There's some cool con-
nections you can make through it," said Johnston. “I’ve gotten
ottered jobs."

Phonathon did not always operate as it does now. It used
to be a week~long event each semester, where students would
come into the Forum North Lounge to
make their calls and ask for donations, or
“gifts," as they are referred to on the phone.
“1r was just madness, in a good way," said
Mickey Munley ’87, vice president of Cole
lege and Alumni Relations, who ran Phona~
than from 19934997. “Lots of energy, lots
of enthusiasm.”

With this enthusiasm, student callers were still able to raise
from szoo,o0mstoo,000 each year. But a major change to
Phonathon occurred around 2000 in ‘response to try to be more
efficient," said Munley. The software was upgraded, it moved to
Mears basement and it became a steady job, employing Smr
dents all semester, These changes have “really streamlined it
into a good program," said Sinick, and they have been able to
perfect their strategies and increase their donations.

But for some, Phonathon is about more than just raising
money. It is about helping the college. Grinnell has one of the
lowest alumni giving rates in the nation and the Phonathon
callers are trying to change that.

“We do a lot of good here on campus," said Sinick, who
makes a donation to the college at the end of each year.
“Whether or not students know that, we do. And that's part of
the job Thar you know you’re giving back to Grinnell.”

“[They’re] so established that you can’tjust say you're not going
to get any money and you can't do what you've been doing for
so many years."

groups, however, will be sent to find their funds from other
sources. “Other departments in the college can and should step
up to support student groups," said McKinley.
