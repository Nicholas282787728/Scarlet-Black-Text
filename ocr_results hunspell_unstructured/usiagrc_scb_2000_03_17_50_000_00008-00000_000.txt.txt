Dear Editor,

Something must be done to re»
store the credibility of the 5&B'
Most intelligent people I tallt to
tend to avoid die paper for fear of
being mlsquoted, misinterpreted,
or made to soundstupid. liust had
my second unpleasant encounter
with this paper; i wrote a long cdi-
totial against the economic sanCv
tions against lraq, and the majority
of it was badly cut. i had started
one paragraph with the sentence.
“but what else can a rich country
use besides military and economic
violence?" intending to go on to list
alternatives, but the editors didn't
publish my alternatives, so it
sounded like lwas Just saying, “Yep,
nothing else to do but be violent, I
guess."

The 523th regularly contains
such errors that breac h even the
bare minimum requirements for a
legitimate paper. l_ast semester.
someone who was never inlcr-
viewed was quoted as saying crro.
neous things, Such incidents pros
duee much disgrunrlemenr. i feel
that ifwc have to choose between
irresponsible Journalism or no at.
ticles at all, it's better to go with
nothing.

i thinlt these problems mostly
have to do withadcmoraliringlaclt

trfy the situation,.l have applied to

position, for the remainder of this

Health organization (WHO) re
port that over a million people,
mosrly children and the cldcrIyi
have died from cancer and disease
in the nine years since the war. A
WHO report says that the war and
sanctions have “contributed to the
semivstarvation diet of the popu-
lation, with viral drugs and sup.
plies unavailable, inducing serous
implications on the health status

of the population and on their
qualityoflife. Assessment missions
report that the quality of health

Dear Editor,

it is Monday night, and i have alt
ready been approached three times
about my comments at last Sunday's
candidate debate. Since Sunday I have
been considering writing a letter to ex-
plain myseifmore coherently than i did
then.

In the end it was not the content of
my three discussions that convinced me
to write this letter, but the diversity of
their messages. One student was int
suited and hurt, another thanited me for
expressing my frustrations (more or less)
honestly, and a third simply enjoyed a
little drama in the proceedings.

Personally, i am not very excited

 

about any ofthese positions, so it must
be time to clarify. I must first admit that
I sufiered from a lack of forethought.
My “question“ was not planned well
enough to even be a question. The core
ofwhat I wanted to say was that twelve
candidates [or SGA president is ridicu»
lous and unncccssary. Iwill explain why
in a moment.

Having said that, i should simply
have invited any candidate who wished
to dcfcnd the presence of so many to
do that. As I recall, the British parlia-
ment tcccntly did a similar thing to one
ofirs houses, requiring each member to
justify his or her cxistencc. The result
was (appropriately) a much smaller
house.

ignoring the individual qualities of
the candidates, there is a concrete rcar
son why twelve is a ridiculous number.
The first election was essentially
crippled by a vote of no conﬁdence. Is
them no lesson to learn from this? The
last three candidates were qualiﬁed and
distinct from each other, and they failed
to survive the election process. Should
twelve people run across a bridge that
previously collapsed under the weight
of three?

Now on to what I did not mean to
say on Sunday. 1 did not mean that the
candidates were simply repeating each
other for lack ofinitiarivt of personal-
ity. What I meant was that the candir
dares were repeating each other because,

 

in practicality, there are

could not have in a well-chosen selec-

their worth by choosing those three than
the candidates themselves?

While I am at it, I would also like to
make an asidc to Jim Hackctt and his
supporters. Sunday night was neither
the timc not the place to criticize Jim's
platform. I did so because, while I do
not agree with Jim's ideas about the
presidency, I do talte his effort seriously.
ifbe were not making a serious attempt
to reach his goal of eliminating the
presidency, there would be no rcason to
criticize him. My comments were not an
attcmpt to attack or ridicule him pct-
sonally, and I do respect his effort ifnot
his aim.

Thanks,
