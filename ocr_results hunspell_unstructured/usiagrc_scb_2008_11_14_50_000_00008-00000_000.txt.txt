Sub-free housing and a shoutout to freesound

Place sub-free in Norris

There is no doubt that we need more substances
free housing. The demand for roon is Signiﬁcantly
grcarct than the numbel orroorns av ble, the result
being that older students and incoming first—years
ali are sometimes not able to live in sub-free hous-
ing ifthat rs their prcfcrcucc.

Ideally, no dorm should have to changc its pl'evis
ous culture, but under the circumstances there is no
other way to meet the demand for subtfreeffhat be
ing said, among the options availablHNorris instead
of Smith, or Cleveland or Main in addition to Smith
and Kcrshaw—Nortis is
the [cast problematic, For
more spccifrc information
on the choices, see the
article from last week's
SSLB.

Main and Cleveland
aren’t viable choices. Main
would be difﬁcult to con-
vert to subrfrce because of Gardner lounge. There is
no practical way to stop the parties in the basement
from affecting the rest of the hall or to restrict sub-
stances to the lounge proper.

Cleveland can also be eliminated from the list, but
for different teasons.The hall has had its current cult
ture for at least ii few decades now, so it would take
a lot of cleaning to get the eau de Cleveland out of
the walls and carpets, Allergies are one of the reasons
some students choose to live in sub-free, and subject»
lag students with srrch allergies to the remnants or
years of moderate substance use is thoughtless.

This is one of the reasons that Norris is the best
choice. The tunic students wrth rrllcrgics and asthma
who would be ncgrrtivcly atrcctcd by the iingcrirrg
varieties of smoke in Clcicland would also benefit
from the air conditionrng in Norris. which ctr-vs; to
circulate and dehumidify the art, making it caslcr to
breathe iii the hot parts ofthe school year,

Norris is also the best choice in terms of space.
out or all the dorms on campus, Norris's nilmbels
of singles and doubles are closest to those needed for
substaiicerfree housing.

The only foreseeable problem With Norris is its
supposed isolation from the rest ofcampus. but Main

is equally far from the cent
tcr ofcarnpus'. Norris is not
treated as though itrs |SOlill’
ed now, and there is no rea—
son to believe that students
will stop visiting friends in
Norris simply because the
dorm is subrfi'ee.

While Smith has been
a great home to subtftee students on campus. it has
only been sub—free since the policy was instituted less
than a decade ago. Despite current perceptions, Smith
is just like any other dorm on campus and could easily
house rron-sub-frcc students again.

One way around this problem would be to tell
firsttyears and their parents to stop being naive about
the lifestyle changes that happen in the ﬁrst year of
coaege with regard to substance use. While it would
be amusing, the prospect of telling patents to accept
that their kids are probably going to dllnk is inappro—
priatc and beyond the College's responsibility.

a

All in all, this decision should not disrupt cain~
pus lifc too much. Campus culture is forever chang—
ing and evolving, and switching around the substance
status of two dorms should be see as more a matter
of pracucaiiry than anything else. A few years from
now, Grinncllians won't know which dorms used to
be subtfrcu,

Freesound is exemplary

All too ottcn, campus organizations exist some
where berwccn r-cnliry and ideal, a mixture of lofty
goals and broken equipment. It can be difﬁcult to
fulfrll original goals for clubs as work builds up. time
beats on and interest wears downijust compare the
size of any club’s email list to its actual meeting attent
dance. But Fteesotintl, a group orcanrpus musicians
dedicatcd helping ouch other rock/mp/scream/mlx,
has shown the campus how to keep your act together
and provide everyone with some spunky fun.

On a basic level, Frccsound does its part to pres
vide campus musicians with equipment and a practice
sptct, which has been ﬁlled during ileost all of its
open hours this semester. Brit this year, Freesound has
continued to build on top ofits already strong foun—
dation, offering more shows with different bands and
extra pizzazzt Mike Kober‘s electronica and a death
metal band in the same room? Hardcore punk show
in Quad? Free nachos in Gardner at 2 a.m..> These
are good things that show all the work Fl'eesound has
put into making music “special” on campus. even as its
budget has been cut to the point they may not be able
to rclcasc their animal “Frccsound CD."

You should go do your thing to some music, be—
cause boy, the sounds tree.

Bringing improvements to Joint Board and Cabinet

Hugh Redford ’10 discusses the new changes that will be affecting student government on the Grinnell campus

As an involved Grinnell student,
odds are that at some pointyon’ve talkr
ed about, thought about, or lamented
about SGA.I'd even up the odds that if
you were complaining, it was probably
about how inaccessible it is,

Well, back up, kiddo. Your friendly
Cabinet and Joint Board both have
gotten the ball rolling on this issue in a
very, very cool way.

On Nov. 5,Joint Board reviewed a
resolution, sponsored by Cyrus Witt
thaus ‘10 and Harry Krcjsa ‘10, that
would move the committee and cabit
net reports to the beginning of Joint
Board. This would put them right
after soap box, at 7
pm. on chnesday
nights. Thus, rtry fa-
vorite part of Joint
Boardiand in many
ways the most usefuli
is now first!

These reports
summarize all of the
cool things going on around Grinnell
in about 20 minutes. This includes
