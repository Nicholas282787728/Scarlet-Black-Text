Grinuell, like most colleges at
this time oi year, has a graduat-
ing class. (The war hasn't hit us
that hard yet). And after four
years the class has left a mark,
or at least a bruise, on the halo
lowed halls of old Gi-inuell. Fol—
lowing is a list of the things Grin»
hell would have missed If the
class of '44 had never happened,
and of the seniors responsible for
‘various events, institutions, and
new Gi-innell traditions.

First we thank Marilyn McCool
ior leading the way in the “This
is War" phase of Grinnell’s exist—
lence by becoming the first ferns
linine student council president in
the history of the trade. Still on
the subject of student leaders, we
vmention the tact that seniors
Wagner, Beckett, Miller, Macmi-
lircy, Knop Russel-L and Adkins
are responsible for the foundings
1oi the Swmging Doors chapter,
w. c. T. U,

Switching to the other one-six-
teenth of the campus, we bring
up the subject of McElravy, now
returning temporarily to the fold,
who, first semester successfully
held up the position of M. o. c,
[man on campus). .And then
there is Dave Sparks, to whom
we shall be eternally grateful for
prov-mg that there still is such al
thing and that spring is for people
as well as birds.

The sit}; is still with us, thanks
to the sterling efforts of those
wonderful girls Barbara Brann
and Catherine Funk, who have
managed to keep the paper on its
remaining toot despite the wolves
howling at the window and the

Mr. s. Skrondahl, employment
manager for the Glenn L. Martin
Nebraska Company of Omaha,
has wired us that their need for
studenw with a major or a minor
in chemistry is very urgent, Dr.
Albert s, Nichols, personnel di-
rector, announced today.

Miss 0pal Adamson or the
Tennessee Eastman Corporation
has also written the college stat-
ing that the corporation is in ure
gent need of students who have
had college training in commerce,
chemistry, mathematics, and phy-
sics. Also, those with work in
home economics and liberal arts.l

The location of the Eastman
project is between the Cumbeb
land and Smoky mountains in a
very beautiful section of Tennes-
see, Miss Adamson writes. Many
college people are employed, and
opportunities for advancement are
good.

A box lunch w i be served to
graduates, {acuity and alumni on‘
the south campus after the Alum-
ni chapel on Saturday. There will
be a charge of sixty cents to all
but the graduates.

Loo/f at What You [Wight Have
:Missed but for 'the Class of ’44

apologies to those seniors whose
names weren't mentioned in the
above masterpiece, They were
left out, not because they haven't
done anything, out because it's
time to go home, and besides they
bribed us to keep their names out

On the musical sidc we've hadiuf plum

contributions by the Homes quin-
tet 7 Bergluiid, Blandiiig, Crens,
Minor, and Bringoir, who have
also done their bit toward keeping
Grinnell alive, though battered.

Contributions to the cause have
been made by others 7 scientists
Ki asu and Noyce, the latter a
fellowship winner and proud ex-

owner or a pin, and the former'

the world‘s champion cheerful ate
titude. The dining room would
probably revert to paper plates it
it Weren't for the fact that Ted
is graduating, And then there's
always Arthur Murray Dooley.

And then there was always the
social (or seainy) side of life _
with or without the army, but
mostly with. For example, we
have the boys coming back to
see Marion Roland, And Marge
Willard with a date from Iowa
city almost every week end. or
course there were Mctlharter's
dates, Hallmairs dates, Childs’
dates, Finnegan’s dates, Balleri-
tine’s dates — need we go out
Oh yes, we fol'gotilﬂel-uer's date.
And Rhoda Anderson, naunting
her married life in our faces.

In conclusion. we extend
