MATEO JURASIC
TAYLOR WYMAN

Kiss of Death

I wouldjust like to take this time
to put forward one of my personal
opinions. Nicholas cage is one of
the coolest, most macho guy around.
While he doesn’t rival Arnold in
sheer strength, Fabio in hair power,
Sean Connery in style, PattickStew»
art in suavity, orWilliam Shntner in
sexual potency, he is so full of ma
chismo that I shudder in the pres—
ence of his image, This movie con—
tinues what Wild at Heart, Raising
Arizona, and Red Rock West do in
elevating Nicky to a state of Divmi—
ty. That's iust my two bits. Oh yeah,
you may be tempted to say "This
movie is a just another Pulp Flo
ti'onesque, Quentin Tarantino rip—
off." Ifyou did, you‘d be right, except
this movie was bad and lacked the
stellar soundtrack of Pulp or Dogs.

Counterpoint (Taylor) I liked
this film. it had a fairly scattered

plot, about six successive plots actu—
ally. David Cartusoisthe mainchar—
acter and the film follows his various
misfortunes to his eventual triumph.
He tries to help a friend by driving
stolen cars to a waiting ship, gets
caught, takes the fall, is double—
crossed by his friend and things con»
tinue downhill from there, The film
attempts to depict a sleazy criminal
world a la Pulp Fiction, but is less
successful. The characters are off—
beat, interesting and almost com—
pletelydevoid ofmorals, Blood,ven—
geance, betrayal. paranoia, and
treachery.., food for the masses,

Before Sunrise

This is an even better film. It
stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpi
(the girl from White), as two strang—
ers who meet on an European train
and have a brief, passionate, singular
life experience amid the bustling
streets ofVienna. Little action oc«
cuts, but some of the conversations
between the two lovers are mesmer—
izing, and both characters are devel—
oped with great intricacy and depth.
It is sweet and soft and fuzzy and
warm and gushy and "’sigh"‘ I wish I
had Ethan I-lawke,

it or not, I found this movie quite
successful in its attempt to portray a
unique and chance meeting between
twoindiVidualswho fallpassionately
in love. While this moVie, when
seen in advertisements, might lead
you to expect another grotesque and
vile RealityBitcsor TIleReani'mator

touching, real life, and highly pOSSh
ble romance without asoundttack by
Pearl Jam, the Cranberries, Alanis

Indiana Jones and the Last Cru—
sade

FINALLY, the Philmz Selexiun
Cumltee does something right. Ev
etybody loves a good Harrison Ford/
Steven Spielberg or George Lucas
movie, yettheirisadisturbinglackof
these kinds of movies in the SGA
movie calendar, Instead we are forced
to endure through lengthy, overly.
profound and yet totally unenter-
tainingmovieslikelndoclime,Death
and the Maiden, Immortal Beloved,
and Spanking the Monkey, In each
ofthese movies, I rooted for the moth
character to kill themselves just to
end the movie, MORE ENTERr
TAINMENT, LESS CULTURE!

Counterpoint (Taylor) A great
film‘ A perfect blend ofexotic an<
cient lands, action and humor. Indy
ridesagain,killingNazisatidchasing
the supernatural. Sean Connery
throws in an unusually humorous
performance, and all your old budr
dies from the Lost Ark are back to
help Indy save the day.

Blues Brothers

A fantastic, divine, top fivt: all»
time film! Thistilmivosmypersonol
request at the films committee meet—
ing, and it is well worthyourtime. It
stars John Belushi and Dan Akroyd
as Jake and Elwood Blues the two
coolest,smoothest, iammin‘est blues-
men ofall time. Jake and Elwood go
on tour with their awesome band
raising money to save o Catholic
orphanage, all while avoiding the
entire Clueogopoliee force, the Good
ol’ Boys (another band), Nazis, and
Princess Leia, This film is filled with
great music (Aretha Franklin, Ray
Charles,CabCalloway,aridofcoursc
Jake and Elwood), classic lines and
the destruction ofover 75 police cars,
not to mention an entire mall.

Counterpoint (Mateo) Eh.. it
as ...Ol< I’ve seen better, but I’ve
also seen a lot worse. While I W|ll
admit that this movie had great mu—
sic, carchases, and gags, it Just never
grabbed me and kept my interest like
it has for so many other people.
Watch it and judge for yourself. I'll
Just stay home and reminisce about
my favorite Melrose episodes, like
the one where Michael pretended he
still had amnesia and then tricked
Sidney into letting him handcuffher
to a hotel bed, and then left. He's so
evil I love it,

At the Grinnell
Town Theater

JENNY BAUM
KATE LYONS

since the movie showing at the
Grinnell Cinema this week, Gold—
eneye, the new 007 (lick, is premier—
ing here, we were unable to review it
aheadoftime. Buthere'swhatPierce
Brosnan, the newJames Bond. has to
say about the film: “Bond was unfin—
ished business in my life, because
wherever I've gone since 1986 peo-
ple have alivays asked: ‘Weren’t you
the guy who was going to be. could
have been, should have been, might
have been,,.' It‘s quite scary that
something like this should come
around a second time" (MoVieliner
November 1995). Since I (Jenny)
have seen all of the James Bond
films, Kate thinks that I should say
something about what to expect. I
predict Btosrian will make lots of
sexualdoubleentendtes,ordetavod-
ka martini, shaken not stirred; blow
up lots of cars and buildings, and
seduce a few women.

It appears that there is some.
thing for everyone on the Grinnell
campus in this film. Brosnan, the
tormerReintngtonsteele, says"l nev-
er took psychetlelics There’s still
time though" in response to being
compared to Cary Grant, u-ho hos
allegedlydroppedaCitl. And now, to
review a movie we saw, all the tiny in
Marshalltown, just so we wouldn’t

read this because we mentioned that
we were topless. We heard a rumor
that Taylor and Mateo ivatch their
movtes topless, too).

Powder is the story oiti purple
eyed albino boy who is affected in
utero by inexplicable forces. GodI
Aliens? Lightning? Us? We thought
that the actor, Sean Patrick Elan—

Jenny and I have something for pale
skinny boys who resemble DaVid
Bowie and are good at physics tricks.
This moVie is a good concept, but
settles into not much more than

fects with lights and magnetized
spoons. We really wanted to see this
moVie because the previews were so
interesting, but we were dismayed to
discover that the plot never tran<
scends them, Powder had the poten—
tial to be a really interesting charnc»
ter harkening back to the era of B»
movies (in Jenny s opinion). 1(Jen.
ny) kept wishing that Tim Burton
had directed it. or spielburg (says
Kate, who really likes Sea Quest),

This film is really implausible
and stretches the audience‘s suspen—
sionofdisbelieftothe breakingpoint.
The Department of Child Welfare
brings Powder to live in a town only
slightly bigger than Grinnell, and
then are surprised to see that he’s a
social pariah. We think that in a big
city he could have been a rock star,
like Dav id BOWie, JeffGoldblumplays
the understanding physics teacher
(oxymoron) who shocks Powder with
o Jacob's Ladder, massages his bald
head, and pronounces him the defi»
nition of electrolysis. Goldblum’s
character starts out as the eccentric
scientist he played in The Fly and
steadily degenerates into the “hip"
pseudoaeienritic jargon spouting
character from jurassic Park .

1 hr. 45mm, dir. Eliseo Subiela;

Eliseo Subiela’s brilliantly un-
settling and hypnotic “Man Facing

annihilation, brutality, and starvo.
tion. Rantes calmly eXploins to the
doctor that he has been sent to Earth
to study these inexplicable events.
Highly intelligent and asking not to
be cured but to be understood, he
sways his doctor‘s skepticism and our
own as director/writer Stibiela raises
fundamentalphilosophicalquestions
about our place in the universe. By
the end, the film’s restraint has be«
