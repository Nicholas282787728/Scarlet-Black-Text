An injury away from going Division l, Kate Reynolds ‘05
is a dominant force on the mound for Grinnell softball

by Jenni Niemlec

Grinnell softball has had an exciting season, but one
orrhe most exeirrng rhlngs abodr Gl'innell‘s sofrball team
is Kate Reynolds ‘05. So Far this season, Reynolds has
been named ro rhe HyaVeeAIIaTournarnent teamr (The
Pioneers went 2-1 in that tournament.) At the MWC
crossover Tournament, held April 1142, rhe Pioneers
wenr 5.0, wirh Reynolds pirching all five games and
rhrowing rwo shurours. She was also named ch
Player of rho week lasr week, and heading inro rhrs
weekend's games had a 13-7 record with a2 28 ERA. In
short, it's hard to imagine where the Pioneers would be
wirhour Reynolds. who has pirched ar
leasr one inning in all our three ofrheir
28 games rhis season.

Born in Muscarlne, Iowa. Reynolds
has been playing sofrball since age
eighr. Reynolds grew up in a softball
ramrly, having five cousins and a
younger sisrer also playing rhe game.
Hcr dad has coached her since the be-
ginning, eonsisrenrly helping ro im-
prove her pitching skills, and her mom
has continually provided her with dis
reerrorr.

“My dad has been my grearesr eoaeh,” says Reynolds,
“And my mom is like rhe roek. i am srrong because of
her."

Like most developing arhleres, there wele times when
Reynolds didn'twant ro practice. She recalls arguingwrrh
her dad ahorrr pirehing pracrice, but is now thankful
rhar he eonrinued ro encourage her. 1r was at rhese tlmes
that her family provided her wirh rhe morwarion ro keep
going.

When sltcwas 15, Reynolds’s Family moved to Wash-
ingron srare, righr ourside ofSeattle, Reynolds arrended
Kenrlake High School, where she plrehed almost every
game. Her ream went to rhe Srarc Tournamenr every
year, and plaeed second her senior year, losing the ﬁnal
game 3.2 in nine innings. She averaged ren strikeouts
per game in high school and holds rho school record for
most career wins and season strikeouts.

She has also won many awards, includlng the South
Puger Sound League (SPSL) All-Area award her junior
year, and the SPSL Most Valuable Pitcher award hcr
senlor year She also made the Tacoma News Tribune
and sourh County Journal All»Area reams her yunror
and senior year and we named player ofrhe Year by the
South counry Journal her senior year. During her se-
nior year, she was also named both Marine Student Ath-
letc and Army Srrrdenr Athlete.

Wirh Reynolds's Suttess came recognirion and tea
eruirrrienr from many Division 1 sofrball programs. By
thcstartofherjunioryear, Fordham Universrry waswin»
ning Reynolds over. However, about a month before
the season started, Reynolds tore her ACLa She decided
ro wear a brace rhroiigh theseason, enabling her ro play
her junior season, hur needed surgery once rhe season
ended, By rhar rrme, Fotdham had sropped ealling.

had losr a lor ofdeyelopmenr rrme. She
was forced ro slow down her pirehing
style, and losr around rhree miles per

hour on her fastball. she focused more

on rhe movemenr and rypes or prrehes

she rhrew rather than rhe speed.

When rhe rinre came to deeide on a
eoliege, it came down ro rwo sehools for
Reynolds. Division 1 uiiiversrry of san
Diego, and Grinncll.

“Academically, Grlnnell is much
srrongerrhnn use," said Reynolds. “My
hody alrendy failed me
once and I knew that I
couldn't rely on ir ro ger
me rhrongh four years
of eollege, so i chose
crinnell for academies
and the less rnrense
sofball environment."

Now in her serond
season. she is very
happy with rhe way
rhings rurned our. Last
‘ season, Reynolds was
ranked 13rh narionally in Dlvlson III for
average strikeouts per game. She also
holds rhe Grlltncll record for niosr eae
reer and season srrikeorirs. Lasr year she
whiffed iss barrers, and her roral ior rhrs
year eur-i-errrly srands at 115.

Another rhing that encourages
Reynolds is her rennrmrres. senior
pireher Megen Beaman is one that
Reynolds works very closely wrrh. and the
rwo makeup whar Beaman ealls “rhe one.
two punch." The rwo pirehers compli.
ment eaeh other, with Reynolds being
more of a movemenr rhrower while
Bcainnn's pirehing purs more emphasis
on speed. Beamari‘s recerrr imury has been
hard on rhe whole scam. especially irs
pirehing srair, but Grinnell has endured.

Reynolds is a Biology maror, and
plrns ro go ro medical school. She wanrs
ro work in rhe field of pedinrries, our she isn’r sore ex-
actly where yer. She edrrenrly renehes pirehrng lessons
ro rwo young girls in Grinnell, and would like ro he a
coach some day. Reynolds doesnr see herselrplaying soft»
ball after college. bur righr now is foeusing on the presenr
season,

“we have grear porenrial this year," she said. “When
we work as a team, we do very well as evideneed at rhe
crossover rorrrriamenr. Next year rhe loss or Dinah
