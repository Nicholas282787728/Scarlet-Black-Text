Breathing easy on the escape

This morningl made air emergcncy phone call to
my mother at’rer- re. rig that my {urine was going
nmvherc,1 had no ski s and I would end up a v. as
honrl, roaming from industrial city to industrial Clr)’
living offthe land and begging for work.

I stepped onto the ﬁre escape off my secorrdstlnor
hallway to get some pri-
vacy while I propped the
door open with a coat
hanger. As my mother 1?
attempted to reason wttli "
my neuroses, the fire csr
cape door on the third
floor slammed shut and
a student handbook, bent in the middle from
being scrunched in between the door and the door
frame, fell between the grated ﬂoor onto my second
ﬂoor landing.

It was it close call. I looked up through the grates
orthc ﬁre escape and saw someone still standing out-
side enjoying the morning air, This fire escape itself
is not very attractive, but during the early days ofthe
year when the rut still feels like summer, the fire cos
cape is my second room. I can watch people walk, cars
drive by, my neighbors come out of their rooms.

I was recently reminded otrhe pttrposc ot’a fir-c es-
cape whert a fine was imposed on my dorm for having
the door propped open. I had forgotten that in case
ofemergency, the fire escape was our way out, not the
clartgrng metal stairs that, on a nice day,I run down

room and bang on the door to get my attention.
Sometimes I wait there with friends as they lln-

The ﬁre escape be-
comes, for first-years, part
of a new daily routine, dangling their legs off the

 

side while sipping morning coftee and watching the
train ramble by. It becomes a personal space. My own

For most students the fire escape has nothing to
do with the name it holds, but is more like a porch.

outside, up where anyone can see me, it is a personal
space. It becomes whatever I need it to be.

In Iowa, Mother Nature rolls over and plays dead

Three years ago, I came to Iowa
from a place where ﬁoods were an
every-ﬁve-year occurrence, where the
only two seasons were “Hot and Wet”
or “Hot and
Dry" and
where “2*

roughly the same sort of relationship.

evident to its human occupants that she
wasn't going to just lay back and take
it while we (ramped across her plains
sowing what we please, thrusting our
plows into her fertile soil and plants
ing our seed in her again and again and
again. Don’t even get me started on the
reaping.

I was expecting resistance, dammit.

No, no,
Mother Nature is a total hitch god-

be competing with dinosaurs right now.
And nobody wants that (except perhaps
the 10-year-old in
me).
