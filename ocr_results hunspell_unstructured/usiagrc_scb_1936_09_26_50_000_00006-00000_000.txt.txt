Schwartz hoped: Nick Padgen,

be in shape for the opening game.

Tackles Are Strong.

On the other hand, the tackles
are showing surprising strength,

In the backfield Schwartz 'was
pleased with the progress of Paul
Hartnek, 205—p0und Golden Gloves
western heavyweight b c xi n g
champion who lettered at guard
last year, but who has been
switched to fullback to plug the
gap left vacant by the failure of
Carl Vinciquerra to return to the
gridiron. Vineiquerra was the
squdd's leading fullback last sea-
son, and then went on to win Cue
Golden Gloves light-heavyweight
championship, a place on the
American Olympic boxing team
and a trip to Berlin, He may
yet report for practice but his
status is extremely doubtful.
Hartnek, however, may fill the
bill, and in that event Schwartz

Sophomore Backs.

A pair of sophomore halibacks.
Billy ”Zipper” Zicsel and Bob
Galonka, served notice on all vet-
erlms that the halfback pace will
he swift this season, and the
yearlings may get the call. But
to do so one of them will have
to surpass Charlie chm, a "find"
of last season who played no foot»
ball before coming to Creighton,
but who suddenly developed into
a hall»carr-ier and passer of un-
usual ability. Klern was hurt in
the third game of the season and
saw no more service, but this
fall he apparently is back in
tom:

Sophomore guards have not de-
veloped as well as expected, and
Schwartz may have to rely on
Fred Reii, Watch-charm veteran,
to fill one starting berth along»
