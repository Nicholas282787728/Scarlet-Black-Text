World Economic
Troubles Related
by Dr. Crundliffe

National recovery plans will not be
completely successiul until inter-nation.
al economic cooperation is secured, Dr.
John B. Crundlific, member of the
Economic intelligence Service or the
League of Nations, declared Wedncs.
clay evening during his lecture in
Herrick chapel. He was discussing
the “Problem or international Equili.
briurrl.”

In order to secure (his cooperation,
three major causes or the present cris.
is must be eliminated, he said, namely
the unstable and fluctuating currencies
of the world. the continuously rising
trade barriers, and the need tor regu.
larization of the financial transactions
of the world. Until these three factors
of instability are removed, he asserted,
there can be only a partial recovery

within the individual nations.

 

Need Economic Sludy

Pointing out the difﬁculties connect.
ed with the study or economic factors
in the various countries, Dr. Crund.
litre, emphasized the need tor more
complete studies along this line, cspec.
ially during periods of great change
such as the world is now witnessing.

Reviewing (he economic situation of
the Twenties, which resulted from the
World War, the speaker pointed out,
that the nations of the world adopted
various temporary measures to avoid
the neccessity of lowering their wages
and standards of living and engage in
other social readjustmean. The result
was depreciation of many currencies.
the growth of trade barriersivirtu.
ally destroying the free bade idea and
the hope of territorial specialization-—
and the increase in financial commit!»
merits to such a point that the debt
burden became too heavy,

World Trade Drops

The growth of trade barriers has so
hindered territorial specialization that
world trade, which is based upon pro.
duction by the most efficient produc.
ers, in 1934 was less than onc.third
the volume that it was in 1929. All

FOR THIS SPRING

over the world these trade barriers
are being erected in accordance with
the prevailing doctrine of economic
self—sufficiency which is doing away
with territorial specialization.

The economic self—sufficiency is car.
rieol so rar that in France the govern.
ment is paying the French farmer a
subsidy to grow wheat at a cost three
or {our times as great as the AAA is
paying the American fannel‘ to refrain
irom growing the identical wheat. This
policy which is detrimental to inter.
national economics will lead to pro.

gressive impoverishment and lower

slandards of living, the speaker pre.
clicted.

bitterness, the acrid sting of
undeveloped top leaves. Why
should you? I don’t tolerate
the harshness of gritty, tough,

bottom leaves. Neither should
you. I give you exclusively the
fragrant, expensive center leaves
