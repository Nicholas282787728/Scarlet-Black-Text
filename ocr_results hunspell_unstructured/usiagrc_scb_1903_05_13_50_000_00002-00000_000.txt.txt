HE Iowa meet. next Satur-
day will give a good
chance (or students to show sup-
port to the track team. Duringa
losing season is the hardest tune
to support a team and after losing
the two meets already held the
student naturally does not feel so
much enthusiasm in gomg to track
games. But in the contest with
the State University the team has
a chalice to win and every student
should be a loyal rooter. Go to
Iowa City and help the team to
return victorious. The meet may
be so close that the inspiration or
a body of Grinnell students may
be the deciding factor.
