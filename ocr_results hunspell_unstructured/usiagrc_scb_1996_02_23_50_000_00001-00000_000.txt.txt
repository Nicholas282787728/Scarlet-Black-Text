Colle e to reassess sexual
assau t pohcy this summer

SCOTT ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

Gtinnell's sexual assault policy
is being revised to make it more ac—
cessible and understandable to Stu»
dents and faculty seeking to press
charges,

A Sexual Assaulr Working
Group of students formed last semes—
ter because “the college has the abil»
ity to make it easier to press a com»
plaint for sexual assault," said mem.

ber Yash Kapur ‘97.

Group member Dawn Thomsen
‘98 explained further that the guide—
lines in the Student Handbook and
the ﬂow chart developed to explain
the complaint process are currently
too complex Among the alrerna.

tives being considered by the group is
a small handbook \V|[h helpful hints
on the sexual assault complaint pro—
cess. The handbooks should be dis»
tributed in dorm barhraoms by next

fall.

Creating a quicker resolution of
the complaint process has also been
a goal ofthe group. A time limit or
rhirry days has been proposed from
when the initial complaint is filed to
whenafinaldecision is reached, and
will be included in the next set of
assault guidelines. SpecialAssistant
to the President Frank Thomas cau—
tioned that not all cases will be able
to be concluded within thirty days
because special circumstances can
arise. For example, if one of the
individuals has a mental illness, the

process cannot proceeduntll the ther—
aprsr and the indiyidual are ready to
proceed Associate Dean ofStudent
Affairs Jennifer Krohn added that
she “had worked with victims for
months after the assault before they
were ready to file a complaint." In
addition, if the accused assailant is
oricampus whenthe chargesare riled,
action could be postponed until the
student returns to campus

The Grinnell College Hearing
Board rules on all complaints ofsex—
ual assault which are voiced to the
college. it is comprised of three fac»
ulty members chosen by President
Ferguson The SexualAssaultWork
mg Group has requested all board
membersreceivesensitivirytraining,
As a result of this request, members

reunificationritled“The Bittersweet
FruitsofaPeacefulRevolution." Both
lectures will take place araprn in rhe
South Lounge ofthe Forum and the
informal discussion will be held at
8'30pm in the Forum Corree House.

Urging students to make the
most of Dr. Lehmann-Gmbe‘s Visit
to campus, Moyer notes that “every
once in awhile we get someone who‘s
significant in government and this is
one ofthose times."

Grinnell College is required by poll»
cy to report any assaults to the police.
The victim chooses whether or not
to have rhe legal charges pressed,

Thomas said the current bale
ance between confidentiality and
keeping the police informed about
events on campus was established by
the President‘s Sexual Assault Task
Force from 1992—1994 and is one
aspect of the current policy which
will not be revised.
