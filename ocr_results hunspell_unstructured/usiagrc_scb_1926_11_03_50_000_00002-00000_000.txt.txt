Dear Editor:

I want to sity a Word about A Jun-
ior's letter which was printed Satur-
day,

I think he ought to be commended
for h interest in promoting chapel
attendance. Allah knows that it needs
promotion!

However, he revealed a lack of in.
formation in one or two respects. The
students do have representation (ll)

Twist his Neck! and he's back

And I would challange his state-
ment shout the odds not being in {an
vor of a presentahle program. Very
few or the faculty members make no
contribution at all on the chapel plats
form. I recall a little tale about an
American tourist who visited an al‘t
gallery in Europe. “Your pictures are
no good," he said to the dourlteeper.
“Sir," replied the doorkeeper, "the pic-
tures are no longer on trial. lt is the
spectators who are on trial.”

The trouble with A Junior is,
think that he wants the chapel talks
to be hrilliant hut not deep, elouiient
hut not too damnahly tliougnt-provok-
ing. Might I suggest that it would do
him good to pay more attention to the
tallrs. He ought not to expect the
chapel tall: to “do him good," but lie
ought to try to capture something
worth while for himself. It is there H
be can but find it. i
