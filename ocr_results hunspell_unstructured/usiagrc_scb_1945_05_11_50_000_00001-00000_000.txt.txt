“I consider that Miss An-

most effective and distin-
guished mombcis of the fw
ulty,” Dr. Stevens said. “For
thirty-seven years, by con-
stant study and observation,
she has maintained the ivom-
en’s physical education do-
partment at Grinneu as one
of the most up—urdate of its
kind in any liberal arts ool-
logo in the United States.
"Not only is she a great ed-
ucator, but a great person.
The college will be poorer be—
cause she will not be with us
after this year."
Under Miss Andersen's Spon—

sorship, many of the outstanding
women’s athletic events, such as
‘Lhe dance intramurals, the Co-

and festivals. have been inaug-

,come traditional parts of the

have been widely commented up-
