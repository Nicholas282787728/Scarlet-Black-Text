Faculty Deliberates Prepping;
Changes In Academic Policies

“The faculty would look with great favor on any
inclination on the part of the students to move in the di-
rection of the reduction or elimination of prepping at Grin-

nell College.”

Thus reads a resolution which was passed by unanimous vote
of the faculty, according to the minutes oi its Monday meetin

In other action, the faculty
defined the duties of and ap-
pointed members to compose a
committee on international af-
fairs and considered certain
proposed changes in academic
policy.

proposed changes in the min-
imum cumulative grade point
average below which a student
will ordinarily be placed on
probation were approved, as well
as policies concerning compre-
hensive examinations.

A proposed change dealing
with honesty in academic
work was defeated. The change
consisted of deleting the third
vulgrzph, which read, “Ac-
cordingly, students who are
dishonest in the preparation of
assignments or in examinations
normally incur the penalty oi
immediate failure in the
course,"-—and that the third
sentence in the fourth pari—
graph (“This my include sus-
pension from eouege") be ex—

panded to read “this may in-
clude failure in the examina-
tion, or the course, or suspen-
sion from college."

With the rejection of the pro-
Posed change, it was decided that
the rule, as it appeared in the
1957—1953 handbook, would stand.
However, the proposal has been
included in the 1955-1959 hand-
book An announcement or the
correction in the handbook will
be placed in student mailboxes.
