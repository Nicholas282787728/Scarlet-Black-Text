vice hi four categories at groups
outside normal calendar days. The
categories are New Student Days,
outside groups approved by the Cole
lege, College-sponsored functions
such as Alumni gatherings, andath-
letic teams that return early ior
practice

Outside groups request to use the
dining halls since they are the
largest iacilities in the county, ac-
cording to Pomerenk, When Saga

session), the college receives 10%
or all the income derived from the

College Costs

The College presently rebains $22.
20 from every Student's full board
role to pay tor the College commits
tments stipulated in the contract,
Specifically, the College is {inane
cially responsible icrgpainting and
redecoratlng, fire insurance, cam-
pus phones and maintenance and
repairs, excluding those due to negs
ligence

Some of these items include repls
acing all the ireezers and coolers
in Cowles last summer, proposed
plans tor the same replacement
in Quad this summer, and eventu-

ally replacing the dishwashmg ma-
chines in both kitciiens.
Sliding scale

A sliding scale is used to pay
Saga its weekly wages which are
costs based on the average num
ber oi students eating either lull
or lunch/dinner board plans per
week. '

At the beginning or the year, the
rate paid per student per day was
at the top or the list when the hi-
ghest number oi students were tak-
ing board, Grinnell soon slid out oi
the top 11404139 range at stu-
dents taking board into the bottom
category ot 6907939 students on hoe
ard.

At this level, the meal cost per
student per day is the most ex-
pensive~$2,42 tor lunch/dinnerand
$2.60 ior iull hoard. Pomerenk exs
plained that the College has been in
all six categories this year, con 'n—
ually sliding down as the attrition
rate has climbed.

Scale Factors

in calculating the sliding pay sc.
ale, the College and Saga consider
in part the all caleteria style ser—
vice, number oi meals served per
Week, number or board days per
year (222 8/6 days this year), the
male/temale ratio and the existing
wage standard ($1.80 per hour).

One Year

The College has only a yearly
committment with Saga, Other iood
services are iree to contact Poms
erenk, who estimates that two or
three services have contacted the
College in the past rew years.
Serious consideration is being
given to opening the held and per
mitting other iood services to visit
the College ioraweektogatnerdata.
If their proposed budgets represent
a substantial net gain, then the Col»
lege would switch Fomerenk pres
iers, however, to “stirupwhatwe've
got,”
