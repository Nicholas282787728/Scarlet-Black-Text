From parade to Hard Copy: vigilantes

Before my arrival in Montana, I deﬁned the term “vigilante"
as part of a headline on Hat-r1 copy—a tilggerhappy husband
avenging an adulreress wife was a vigilante, a gas station owner
performing retribution for an unresolved robbery was a vigilante.
The term certainly leaned toward the pejorative, even edging close
to prejudiced: where I came from, a vigilante was a epithet for
white trash, Little did I know how much Montana loved its leg-
endary vigilantes, and how to them, rhe word mng synonymous
with true justice,

Before the formation of the Montana Territory in 1864,
the area lacked law enforcement, or laws at all for that inat-
ter. in a region where miners struck gold with shocking fre
quency along Montana's gulehes,wrth thriving bordellos line
ing the streets, thievery arid homicide mn rampant through
those Rocky Mountains, The infamous road agenrs of
Vrrginin City, known for robbing and eliminating travc'lr
ers along the mountain passes, had become a signiﬁcant
concern to the citizens of the surrounding
towns, A vigilante committee was formed
to seek out the source of these atrocities and
bring them to justice in the unpatrolled, perilous ‘ '
area. Lead by prosecuting atromeyWilbur Fisk sanders and Chief
iusrice Sidney Edgcrron, rhe vigilante committee hanged 21 road
agents and other offenders, including the infamous Sheriff Henry
Plummer, the mastermind behind the road ngentopcialion,

The story of rho vigilanrcs is cerrainly a source of pride to
Monranans, and, dare I say it, they almost wotshi the legend. A
topic of some debate, some scholars identify the ' ante’s trade
mark number, 3-7-77, as the amount ot’timc a criminal had to get
out of town before the vigilantes arrived, as the dimensions of the
grave the vigilantes would dig for the criminal, and as a number in
the Masonic Order for a sacrosanct ritual. Neiertheless, the num

Vomit policy is

Beforel launch into a polemic on college policy, let me first say
that I'm not in the least bit indignant. To facilitate a better under-
standing of the situation, let me offer some background. On 10710,
there were two instances of uncleaned vomit: one in Lazier, and
one in Loose Pit. Aside from the obvious
lack of“sc|frgoveniance”on the part ofrlre
students, the administration is charging
$66.55 for each case of vomit. The prob
lem is, 10-10 did not go to Loose, much
less Loose Fit. Why is the Ultimate ream
getting charged? Apparently, witnesses
reported that the vomiter “was at 10710."
Forget that the witnesses didn‘t help a fellow student in need, but
rhey also failed to identify the person. I've already know that self-
govemance is lying in a shallow grave somewhere, but this adminis-
tration policy in unacceptable.

But like I said, I'm not indignant. In fact, this kind of thing is
funny to me. 1 considered writing a serious letter aimed at prompt
ing student reaction, but given my experience with Grinnell college
and the student body, I can already predict rhe reaction I call rhis

Responsible

. journalism

An old American adage holds that journalism &X*
ists to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afﬂicted."
Whether it's uncritically accepting the Bush Administra-
tion's false rationales for rushing to war or turning away
in the face of corporate scandal, we regret to say that too
many in our field have forsaken this principle.Well amre
of journalism’s declining integrity, we at the 56913 work
hard to play an active, adversarial role.

In recent weeks, we have taken heat for this approach.
For instance, some have criticized our investigative piece
on SGA election practices as biased. This may come as a
surprise, but we disagree with this assessment. On a gen~
eral level, it’s our job as responsiblejoumalists to side with
the powerless and check abuse by government. It's our job
to ask the hard questions even when it makes people unr
comfortable.

Beyond fulfrllrng our adversarial role, we are also ob»
ligated to report factual information to the public and let
them draw their own conclusions from it. Thus, it would
be wrong for us to ignore whenarr SGA candidate’s griew
antes are thrown out on a technicality or to not report
connections between members on election board.

Our staff does not always agree on how principles of
journalism should apply in any given situation. For in
stance, last week some staff members, and other students,
objected to the decision to print letters to the editor di»
recrly addressing a student's Plan. Most of the dissent
questioned the validity of taking someone’s informal rant
on Plans, a forum closed off to non-Grinnellians, and
transferring it to a formal forum in the 5553, which all
have access to. Dissenters also feared we had set a danger-
ous precedent for all Plan wars to now become acceptable
discourse on the opinion page.

After giving the matter some thought, most stat’t'mem-
bers can at least agree that the letters printed last week are
far from something to worry about. They borh addressed
campus diversity and racism in a thougluful and comprer
hciisivc way, It would have been irresponsible to dismiss
these letters out ofhand just because they reference Plans.
For some the threat of slippery slope still presents a con,
ccrn. Most, however, have reached the conclusion that it is
impossible to have a free-standing criteria for evaluating
letteis.

Each letter is unique and must be evaluated on its own
merits. Unless a letter is clearly inappropriate (eg. poten~
tinlly libelous or a blarant advertisement),we will strongly
consider it for print, In cases where it is unclear whether a
letter should be published, we will err on the side of pine
moting dialogue over silencing opinions. After all, without
input from our readers, we could easily become the com-
placent entities we challenge.

unjust: isn’t that hilarious?

vomit policy out for the bullshit that it is, a few students might get
up in arms for a few days, maybe rant on plans,th nothing changes.
With enough distraction and proper medication, everyone will for—
get all about the gross injustices we live with So rather than get mad

at the lack of change on this campus, I
just laugh. Some of you young idealists
might turn your noses up at this cynical
senior, bur believe me, fighting college
policy is an exercise in futility. ifcollege
has done one tlung, it has beaten the
idealism our of me and replaced it vvrth
jaded laughter. Anyway, back to the inat-
ter at hand. Let me tell you a funny story about vomit.

As of this semester, the price ofvomit is 36655. If you blow
chunks and decide not to clean it up, you (or your ﬂoor) will be
charged that amount. Maybe it’s just me, but this seems like a lot
of money; if I could make that kind of dough cleaning barf, I never
would have gone to college. Where did rhis magic number come
from? How much is itifl drop adeuce in the drinking foun 'n.>
Whar about peeing in the garbage? 1 know what you're thinking:

charging studenrs an arbitrary amount of money for their irrespmr
sibility is contrary ro the philosophy of Self-govemance—and really
ﬁrmly! But it gets better, The $66.55 doesn't even go ro the worker
who cleans up the vomit! The money goes to—get this~thc ml,
lcgc's “general fund" FM workers get the same pay for that day, no
matter how much pilkc they mop up! Not only is the vomit policy a
childish deterrent, but it also does nothing ro recompense rhe labor
of FM workers, who already have to put up with so much of our
bullshitl Hilarious!

So where has this policy gotten ns? 1 puke wherever 1 rant,
somebody else cleans up my mess, the college gets more money, and
my dad doesn’t get his damage deposit back I canjusr turn my back
and pretend it never happened. i dorit have to look FM workers in
the eye, right? My dad paid for it, so that makes everything better,
right? That'sjustice, right>

OrI wuldjust puke in the out ofdoors, like God intended.

I would write more, but this is all so hilarious I am going to
vomir. Oh, the irony is killing me!
