Glass Hurts Drake

Young Peyton Class II of the Okla-
home Agricultural and Mechanical
college, will cut into Drake hopes in
the dashes. Podrebarac of the Bulk
dogs and Hensley of Grinnell will
probably split honors in the hurdles.
Drake will probably pick up the nic-
jority of points in the quarter, half,
and mile with Van Laningharn, Dun-
can, and Gordon in shape, but Mur-
phy, Thomas, and McIlrath, should
pull Grinnell through with a fair
share of the honors.

The two mile event will be one of
the feature races of the day with Pil-
brow of Crinncll matching strides
with Jenkins of the Aggies. Jenkins
trimmed the little Grinnellian at the
Kansas relays, but Pllbrow turned
the tables on him at Drake.

Bulldog Advantage in Field

The chief Drake advantage comes
in the ﬁeld events where the Bulldogs
