The proposed revising of SGA
budgetary procedures was
discussed at the Joint Boards
meeting Wednesday The new
budgetary procedures would move
the date that committees are to
submit budget projections for the
next year ironi the end oi April to
the end of February. The ad
vantages of the revisions presented
by SGA President Will Collins are
as follows:

1) Under the new procedures, the
budget would be prepared by an
experienced president and cabinet.

2) Students working on budget
considerations would not be rushed
by iinals.

3) A iull contingent of eomv
mittees would be available to
present projected budgetsias it is
now, some important committees
are in transition at the time that
budget projections are due.

4) The Social Coordinating
Committee would have more time
to plan events.

5) The budget would be drawn up

The Griiillell Scarlet and Black. November 7. HHS—p. 2

Budget decision delayed

by the president and cabinet,
whereas now the incoming
preSident is likely to ask the advise
of the SGA president only.

6) The traumatic beginning of a
new administration would be
alleviated, agd SGA would achieve
greater continuity

Collins listed and answered
possible objections it is difficult
for a committee to project costs for
the rest of the semester and the
next year so early, but. Collins
argues. the date is not enough
earlier to cause problems; to the
argument that the incoming SGA
president Would not be able to
implement his own priorities,
Collins replies that this is not
trueithe budget is revisable, and
he claims that it is unlikely that the
incoming SGA president may
attempt to overthrow the entire
budget.

Discussion followed Collins’
speech, Brent Schondelmeyer,
chairman of the Student

Close Number?

by Toni l’antea

On April 29, l975, a bar opened in
town which geared itself to the
college coinmunit y March 1975
it may not be in ex stance. The bar
is The Number, run by Brian
Mullan; lack of business is the
reason [or its possible closing. With
costs including 3200 for bands on
weekend nights, substantial
renovations. and the replacement
oi stolen glassware, the nightly
attendance is too small to generate
the revenue to cover eosts.

According to Mullan, he
established the bar basically for
the college clientele, But in return
he feels he has received very little
support from that sector Mullan,
after hearing complaints about the
Pub and other drinking establishr
ments in Grinnell, finds it disapr
pointing that The Number, with its
entertainment and low and special
prices, is not enjoying greater
popularity,

One cause [or the low at-

myth that a rough and rowdy
crowd frequent The Number. “We
probably have less trouble than the
Pub. Since being open we have had
only three fights and those were
cut short quickly," he explained.
Another cause which Mullan feels
is significant is that the students
are isolating themselves on the
campus. “The opportunity is here
to go downtown and associate with
others than those at the college,
which I feel' would be very
enriching not only for the students
but also for the town.” he come
merited.

In the final months before The
Number’s lease expires, Mullan
will try to bolster~his business by
Showing nostalgia movies two
nights a week (Marx Brothers,
WC Fields, etc . . ,) having live
music nightly (including college
musicians), continuation of 15 cent
draws on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
and possibly adding a lady‘s night
on Wednesdays
