basketball team is the Midwest
Conference Champion. The Pier
ncers ended an outstanding 2074
season with an exclamation point.
beating Lawrence University and
Illinois College at the conference
toumttmcnl Grinncll hosted last
weekend.

The team had their hands full in
their opening game against 4th
seeded Lawrence Fridaynight. The
Vikings had pltlycd the spoiler to
the Pioneers a year ago beating
them in the championship game.

Lawrence was ready for the
toumament'snumberoncseedand
came out smoking, shooting 58%
from the ﬂoor on the way too 31-28
halftime lead. The Grinnell crowd
was rightfully nervous as they
watched whatCozrch Ted Eskildsen
called“thebcstdefensiveteamever
to play in Darby Gym" control the
Pioneers at the defensive end.

Grinncll had entered the game
planning to outlast the Vikings.
however, and the plan paid off.
Calling fcw timeouts during the
contest the Pioneers‘ turned the
game into a grind. and simply wore
Lawrence down. Tlle shots stopped

nell won the game With a 20 to 6
margin from the charity stripe, The
final score wa364»59. “Weplayed
hard. we hung in there. and we

won." said student assistant coach
Opie McGuire. There was also “a
years worth of frustration gone,"
according to Jen Wood.

The Pioneers came at the Via
kings with a balanced team effort.
Missy Sharer had 27 points. Wood
had 12. and Amy Fort scored 11.
Suellen Hageman‘and Tera Jones

well rounded play (6 points. 6 re
bounds, 5 steals. and 4 assists).

closing minutes that helped seal a

Against Lawrence the Pioneers
were hesitant but against lllinois
College thercwas simply noticubl.
Grinnellwasin controlt‘rom startle
finish. leading by 7 at the half, and
winning the game by is, 77-62.

Grinnell defeated Illinois much
more handily than they had done on
thesamecourtaweekbefore, where
they had only won by only 6. The
Pioneers zapped the power of the
Lady Blues' scoring battery of
Dawn Heyel and Vickie Mteners,
getting them in foul trouble early.
The pair that had combined for 48
points the week before finished
With only 22 Saturday.

For Gnnnell the game was un
doubtcdly the Missy Sharer Show.
The senior capmin ﬁnished her ca-
rcer with 42 points. 7 assists, and 7
rebounds. leading Grinnell in all
three categories. Sharer stressed
the play of her teammates, how-

ever. saying that “evcryone con-
Lribuled.”

Eskildsen said of Sharer's per-
formancethat“itwasstmplyagrcal
player doing great things at a span
cific point in time." Sharer had ten
straight points after lllinois Col-
lege had cut the lead to 3 in the
second half.

The team effort was what the
coach stressed tnost, however. “The
most gratifying feeling is to know
that everyone improved Utcir game
and played an important role in the
Victory." “Everyone came up big.
and “played a great all around
game," added Wood.

Sharercotnmented thatGrinncll
being chased for the championship
was“anew position to bein.“Wood
characterized it as the “ realization
ofa goal we had set out to accom-
plish a long time ago.” Both agreed
that this was an excellent basis for
a rich women’s basketball tradition
here at Grinnell,

Amy Fort summcd up the basis
ofan ongoing tradition while corn-
mcnting on the two wins last week
end. “We anticipated the pltly of
Lawrenccand lllinoisCollege,”she
said. adding that “they were not
only overwhelmed by our big scor-
ers, but they did not expect the rest
of the team to play as well as they
did. They could do nothing but
react to a team that had struggled
through so much and who had the
biggest hearts on me court,"
