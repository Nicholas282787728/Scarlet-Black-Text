Men’s team ﬁnishes second,
behind powerful Stevens Point,
while women improve to third in
the 42nd running of the Les Duke
Invitational at Oakland Acres

3v KEVIN BVRNE

Neither Pioneer cross country team won the Les
Duke Invite last week, but neither Pioneer cross
country team was disappointed.

That’s because the men ran a better race than they
had a year ago at thcir only home event, despite rm-
ishing second and nor repeating, while the women
improved dramatically from last year’s Les Duke by
taking third place.

“I was very pleased with the performance of the
team," said men’s coach Will Freeman. “They per—
formed across the board at a higher level than the
team did last year when they won
the meet."

Women's coach Evelyn Frec-
man was also happy with her team’s
ﬁnish.

“Last year our ream as a whole
did not run well at Les Duke," she
said, “so ir was nice to see that we
put last year’s race behind us and
ran a competitive race this year."

The Pioneer women ﬁnished
behind only Carleton and Gustavus
Adolphus, with Sarah Spencer ‘08 leading the way {or
Grinnell with an 11th place ﬁnish in a time on4:19.
Her teammates Erin Booth ‘07 and Meredith Groves
‘02 were light on her heels, running times or 24:47
and 24:50, respectively

“We are a very dccp team with nor much ora time
span between our top ninncrs," said Freeman, “There
were also a number of out team mcmbcrs who had a
loss than terriﬁc first meet last week at Luther and
weie much improved at Les Duke."

The runners also knew that they had put up some
gtctlt times as compared to last year’s running ofthe

meet,"

in the right direction.

“Individually, I was happy with how I ran," said
Booth. "Compared to last year 1 did a lot better As a
team, we did amazing. A lot orrhe women had really
great races.”

The men’s team ran times thar would have won
last year’s Les Duke and ﬁnished only behind power-
ful Wisonsinrstcvens Point, which
is currently ranked sixth nationally
and wasn't at Grinnell's event a year
agojusnn Riley ‘oo was Grinnell's
top runner for the second week in
a tow, ﬁnishing second overall with
a time of 25:43. Teammate Drive

Adam Beals ‘06 ﬁnishcd as a pack
picking up the 11th , 14th places. Three ﬁlst’yciu's,
