They cap off their three—game home
stand against Macalester on Satur—
day at 4:00pm. “Coe had a pretty
good team at the end of last season,"
commented head coachlohn Pfitsch.
He added, “Macalester is one of the
best teams in the very good Minne—
sota Conference. We are in for an
uphill battle against them.“

In order to defeat Macalester,
the Pioneers hope to post the same
level of offensive output they had
against Illinois College. Three dif—

to the shutout Victory, Senior Neil
Goodspeed scored midway through
the first period on a penalty kick.

scoring with a late goal. “The men
played well," commented Coach
Pfitsch “I felt much better about
this team after the game."

Not only did the offense play
well, but the team also put up a good
defensive effort. Coach Pfitscli sin—
gled our freshmen Darren Bass and
Dustin Ooot for their performances,
“Bass and cost played extremely
well at fullback," he said. “Defen—
sively, we were much stronger than
I had expected. We did not have
many breakdowns."

If the men’s soccer team can
replicate the type of performance
they had against Illinois College,
the Pioneers stand an excellent
chance of starting out their season
with a 3»O record. But Macalester
will pose a tough challenge. The
orinnellians will need to be on top
of their game hoth offensively and
defensively if they hope to extend
their winning streak to three.
