my appreciation to those who
spent their time and energy in
my support. I don‘t have the
words that could thank them
enough."

“I hope that my former op-
ponents can serve the students
in other capacities during the
next year." said Earl. "The high
qualities of the candidates was
the major reason tor a great
campaign."

Concerning next week’s north

the hope that the men
elect their“ council members
carefully." The president de-
scribed a good representative as
one . . that will most capably
express and carry out the stu-
dents’ wishes. \

“1 hope the students’ interest
in their campus government
won’t end with the final ballot."

enthusiasm shown in the cam.
paigns and at the convention, i
can’t help but feel that next
year's student government can
be one of the strongest and
most efficient in Grinnell his-

Convention Baillie Ends
By Tenth-Ballot Ruling

What many acclaimed as “the
best campaign on this campus
in ten years" came to an and
Monday after a climactic week-
end. Earl Peisner was elected
Student Council president by a
Vote of 485—455 over Charles
Harpole.

AS the 5&3 ELECTION EX-
TRA predicted last Saturday,
the convention was involved in
a threercornered fight between
Berkley, Harpole, and peisner
for the nominations.

Just before the convention
Saturday afternoon, the Berkley

Bandwagon, a collection of
ﬂoats, decorated autos, a surrey,
and a band, paraded around the
campus and stopped before
Darby gym. .

The fight on the floor became
more intense after the weaker
candidates began to drop out,
and the search for loose dele-
gates rose to a iever pitch.
Weiss. Jones, Roeder (who had
followed the Berkley Bandwag-
on in a manure wagon), Glam-
an, and Pudvan dropped out be-
iore the tenth ballot. Berkley,
a close third, was eliminated by
the tenth-ballot rule, and Peis-
ner and Harpole were nomin-
ated on the eleventh ballot.

A notable feature of the con-

vention was the strong support
of the candidates by partisan
spectators several cheering duels
were fought by the Harpole,

Peisner and Berkley partisans,
while humor was provided by
the Roeder cheers.
