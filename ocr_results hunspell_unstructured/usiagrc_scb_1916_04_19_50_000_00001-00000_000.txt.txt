well in rebuttal, .uith Frtdlulld an
able second. All tlii-ec of the Gr‘n-

The debate was opened by Clail

third that the iii’nimum wagc law is

Ralston opened for the negative,
stating that the minimum wage law
is the wrong solution, because the
condition are not as bad as pictured,
Lhe ccnd ions are due to uncmploy
went and that the unemployment .
due to the high rate or immigration.

Fridlund proved that the minimum
wage law would better these condi-
tlons living, as shown by the expe-
rience of Australia, England, and the
United States.

Evans aigucd that the minimum
wage law is iinpractie , first because
the constitutions or forty-nine slat
would have to be changed; second,
grail would result; third, there would
tie a cost or three and a halt million
a year; and, iourtb, the increase in
wages would be sent back to the loi-
cign lands

The negative case was completed by
Berger, who maintained the position
that the minimum wage law would in,
crease the industrial evils of the im-
employed and increasing immigration.
He closed by stating that the i-estiic-
tion of immigration is the only log" al
remeél‘a '

Bennett in his ﬁnal rebuttal tore
down seV ral ol the main pillars oi
the negat e case. He quoted authori-
ties to show that more than two per
cent of the unemployment is caused
by low wages. He also showed that
me exnen e of operation would not be
so enormous He overthrew the cone
stitutional argument and succcsstully
attac ed the method or re. ction of
immigration as brought (oi-ward by
the negatiic.
