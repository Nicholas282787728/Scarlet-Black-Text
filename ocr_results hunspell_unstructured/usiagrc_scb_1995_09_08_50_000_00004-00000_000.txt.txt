After a year or two of the Grin»
iell campus band scene, you may
,hink that ifyou’ve heard one group,
Iou’ve heard them all. Blue Cheese
my share the dark ind Ie<tocl< sound
with other bands, but their humor,
)hilosophy, and fan devotion 7 the
.wist they add to the formula —
make them an act to see.

The three current members of
BlueCheese,sophomoresTomChoi,
Cory Turner and Lee Zappas, define
their music as “sold—out alterna»
grungeslop rock", to be more precise.
Fast members have brought funk and
Dead—type rock sounds to the band’s
music, but the present lineup shares
mainstream grungy and metal influ-
ences like Nirvana and Radiohead,
and their songs reflect these Intel”
ests. “We‘re not afraid to admit we
don’t listen to indie rock," says gui—
tarist Choi. Besides their famous
inﬂuences, Chet says he seeks to be

as inspiring a guitar player as iiiniurs
BrianMuiidyand]ainesRechs.Turn—
et admires junior seth Hoslet, and
Zappas says he would like to have
Choi’s singing abilities.

On their way to becoming the
solid core unit they are today, Blue
Cheese has played with two other
guitarists and three bassists. Their
most recent bass player, Matt Whit—
ney, was dismissed from Grinnell af-
ter last semester and was last known
to be in Arizona. The remaining
members, who had been together
since the beginning of the ‘94395
schoolyear, felt that they had finally
achieved the sound they were \Vorke
mgrowardswrthWhitney. Theyare
planning to tenatne the band “Matt"
in his honor after their first show this
year. Their frequent name changes
(at least 6 different names were used
last year) are another way in which
the constant ﬂux that rs an inescnp»
able part of Blue Cheese has mani—
fested itself.

The band’s repertoire currently

consists of 10 original songs. With
five more in the formative stages,
and “two very bad covets," Blue
Cheese played fotlr live shows last
year, all towards the end of second
semester. When asked why it took
themapproxlinatelyasemesteranda
half to begin performing in front of
large audiences, the group cited their
lineup problems. too innin- argu—
ments, and “too many yo’ mama
jokes" as setbacks. Once they began
playing on the campus circuit, how»
ever, they were very well received by
long—tune fans who had attended
practices, as well as by students new
to their music. Blue Cheese estab»
lished their personality by being the
only campus band at the time to
smash equipment, have underwear
thrown on stage during a perfor»
mance, or inspire an official line of

Pagan music circle

AARON DALE
SCOTT ANDERSON

Grinnell is probably the only
liberal arts college in Iowa to boast
not one, but two active pagan orga»
nizations. The Pagan Discussion
Circle, which began in the fall of
1993, sponsors pagan meetings, wot»
ships and attempts to educate the
testofthecampusaboutpaganevents.
Its recently—created offspring is the
aseyet eponymous pagan music en»
semble, which will concentrate on
making mostly choral pagan music.

The ensemble was created by
recent Grinnell graduate Kathryn
McCarthy, a.k.a. Kathryn Devany
Fitewoman, in anticipation of the
Discussion Circle’s upcoming Pagant
fairs symposium, which will be held
during the last five days of October
(thus culminating in the pagan hol-
iday Samhain, known colloquially as
Halloween, on October 31). The

symposium will feature two speakers

brought in from Iowa City, a panel
discussion, and other events, includ—
ingasortofinteractivemusic festival
given by the ensemble in Herrick
Chapel on Saturday, October 28.

McCarthy says that the ensem—
ble will sing “maybe twelve songs" at
the festival. ”The rest will be work—
ing With the audience," she says, in—
cludingsing—alongs and, possibly, an—
dience requests. She says it will be
“kind of like a campfire, in Herrick
Chapel, without the fire." The idea
is that the festival is supposed to be
symbolic of the way paganism works.
She says that paganism is not supe
posed to be “someone standing up
there telling you what to do...you
can’t be a pagan if you don‘t do some
research on your own.”

The ensemble has a tentative
size of about fifteen singers. The
music they will perform is, according
to McCarthy, veryslmple. “It’s mostly
chants,” she says, featuring simple
melodies and patallelharmanles. The

songs come fromavarletyofcllltural
backgrounds The ones she intro

Native American, Hindu, Chinese.
and Sumerian/Babylonian pieces,

forming sometimes attempt 2. genes.
a1 blend of those inﬂuences, while
others try to emulate a particular
style.

The group wtll even perform

self. She is also serving as the con«
ductot, but, she says, “My musical
experience is limited to five years in
Grinnell singers. I ended up as the
conductorbecauseit’ssomethingl’ve
wanted to do, and I have the time to
do it. There are better musicians
than me in the group.”

That can be intimidating, she
says: “I feel kind of strange some—
times leading a choir where i know
I’m not the best musician in the
choir, but then I know it’s not all

Though the ensemble is current-
ly all choral, McCarthy hopes to add
some other instruments to the group.
About half of the songs she plons to
perform include drums, so o drummer
