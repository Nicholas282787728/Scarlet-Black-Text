Cagers Drill
for Encounter

With Bulldogs

Proceeds of OpehingContest
at Des Moines Friday
for Charity

With the opening of the 1931-32
basketball season less than a week
away. the Grinnell Pioneers are drill-
lnv hard for their initial encounter
wiih Drake, the first of a series of
three games Friday, Dec. 13. The tilt
will he a non»conference affair, pro-
ceeds going to charity, and the re<
sults will not count in the loop stand-
ings.

Coach John C. Truesdale has a
nucleus of four veterans, Captain Mc-
Creary, Duncan, Ullrich, and Edman
from which to build his aggregation.
Although he has not yet divulged any
semblance of a starting lineup, two
men are certain of their positions,
and a third, Dick Ulli-ich, will in all
probability start at guard as Captain
McCreary’s running mate.

Duncan Certain

A number of combinations have
been tried in order to find the most
efficient forward pair. Frank Duncan
is assured of a post at either center
or left forward, and if he continues
his form shown in practice the last
few days, he will once again rank
high among Valley scorers. He finish-
ed second to Maurice Van Ackercn,
Creighton captain. in the final stand-
ings last season.

The fourth letterman, Edman, has
seen service at center and may get
the call there. Don Rowe, six-foot re-
serve from last year’s squad, may de<
velop into a constant scoring threat.

Sophomores Good

Mickey Frye, and Bobby'Wa'ite,
Coach Truesdale's sophomore for-
wards, have been making strong
bidsfor first team berths. Frye’s ac-
curate shooting and Whites floor
play have been features of the week's
practice sesions, together with Dun-
can's work. In addition, Louis Wolfe.
a reserve forward. and Schmaedecke,
guard of two seasons ago, have shown
up well, while Christoffersen has
given a good account of himself at
guard.

Prospects areidull in the Bulldog
camp, while several good men are on
the coast traveling with the football
team. Boelter will build his quintet
aroundEverett Schultz, six-foot—four-
inch center and Don King. brother of
the versatile Lynn King, former blue
and white athlete.

Bowers, Hokjohn Absent

Abram. xanders, and Jenks, a trio
of Roosevelt High school guards will
be available, while Coach Boelter will
have Olson, Agard, Wright, and Win-
ters to work with king at the for-

wards.
The return of two lettermen. Bow-

ers and Kokjohn, from the western
football trip. together with Wieland
and Brechler, two sophomores, will
strengthen the squad. Frank Smith,
flashy center, will become eligible at
the beginning of the second semseter.

College Quartet Will Sing
at Methodist Church Sunday

Special Christmas music will fea-
ture Sunday morning services at the
Methodist and Congregational church-
es. A quartet of college men, Fred
Ohl, Robert Sboulberg, Jack Peoples,
and victor Baumann will sing “Lu
How a Rose e'el' Blooming” (Prae-
torius), at the Methodist church, and
Elias Blum, organist, will play as a
prelude the German Chorale, “From
Heaven High I’ve Come to You.”

The Methodist choir will sing the
Old French Carol, “Draw Nigh, lm-
manual,” and the Old English Carol,
“What Child is This." The Rev. C. R.
Zimmerman will speak on "The High»
est Good." The Congregational church
choir will sing appropriate carols, and
the Rev. Robert W. Inglis’ sermon
subject will be “Sharing.”

The. Rev. William Welch of the
Baptist church has chosen as his top-
ic, “Remcmbcring God." and the Rcv.
w. J. Stewart, Unitcd Presbyterian
minister, Will discuss “Peace” and
“Anxiety." The lesson-sermon in all
Churches of Christ, Scientist, will be
“God, the Proscrvcr of Man" and the
Lutheran church pastor, A. Thalack»
er, will speak on ”Our Hopc as We
Await Judgement Day.”

Bogia Horska Breaks Indifference
to Win Local Approval at Recital

By H. W. MATLACK
(Professor of Organ)

At the closc of her first group
Madame Bogia Horska left her audi—
ence slightly perplexed and not very
enthusiastic, but as the program ad»
vanced she broke down the indiffer-
ence that had begun to show itself
last night in Herrick chapel, and be-
fore the evening was over she had
her listeners eating out of her hand.

Wonderfully expressive hands they
are, too. Madame Horska depends on
her hands, her features, her perfect-
‘ly trained body, to supply the char
acterizations which are her special
artistic message. She is what Chau-
Lauqula. fans speak of as an “imper-
sonater,“ but with a difference, and
oh, what difference!

Against a background of exquisite
piano music she half-talks, half-sings,

Student Tryouts Tuesday
for ‘Merchant of Venice’

Although plans for "The Merchant
of Venice" were upset by “The Apple
Cart.” tryouts for the Shakespearcan
play will be called Tuesday evening
in room 11 of Alumni Recitation hall,
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
drama, said today.

Freshmen are eligible for these
tryouts, and glee club members wish»
ing to read Tuesday evening may
come after practice. Each person who
tries out must know what part he
wants to read, and should bring his
own book, Mrs. Pryor said.

Blum Piannforte Recital
First of Student Series

The first student recital of the year
will be given in Herrick chapel Wed-
nesday, Dec, 16, when Betty Blum,
assisted by Margaret Shcrman, will
present her junior pinnofortc rccital.

Miss Blum has chosen for her pro-
gram a Sonata, op. 26. by Bccthovcn,
combining four movements—Andante
con variazioni, Scherzo, Marcia Illne~
hrc sulla morte d’un El'ae, nnd Allc
gro, Lento by Cyril Scott; Hark, hark
thc Lark, Schllbel‘tvLiszt; Ballade, op.
38, F major, Chopin; and Suite for
Two Pianos, Romance and Waltz, by

 

Arensky.

 

always in character, making each oi
her songs a little drama in which she
acts all the parts. At times it seemed
more satisfactory when shc left off
her singing and merely rccitcd, but
there were moments when her little
voice perfectly fitted the character-
ization. .

The recital Was really a duo, for
the piano parts were literally recre-
ated under the deft imagination of
Miss Elsa Fielder and surrounded
Mme. Horska with a tonal tapestry
of lovely texture. it was not easy to
determine whether Miss Fiedler was
interpreting Mme, Hoi-ska, or the oth-
er way ’round. so perfect was their
collaboration.

Mme. Horska was at her best in
sophisticated characters; she is es<
sentially a comedians, and her audi-
ence received with increasing joy the
seductive chansons that were spiced
with a little dash of “it." One can
suspect, however, that in making out
her program she imagined that she
was to sing before an audience con-
sisting largely of school girls, andv
that she censored herself rather rig.
orously. She needn't have bothered.
There was consequently a little too
much of the gruesomeitwo violent
murders, several deplorable deaths,
and the ferocious song of the French
revolution

A significant feature of the pro-
gram was the type of sources from
which her material was chosen—folk
songs, song of the proletariat, songs
of frustration. with not a hint of the
romantic and sentimental ballads
which until lately have formed most
singei-s' repertoires. In this programl
it was possible to observe how post
war artistic impulses, already pro-
foundly affecting painting. poetry,
and drama, are finding expression on
the concert platform also.

Ruckmiclz Says
Emotions Play
Important Role

Emotions, said Christian A. Ruck»
mick. professor o[ psychology at the
University of Iowa in his talk here
Thursday night, play an important
role, along with other elements in
determining man's adjustment to his
environment.

If, as many persons believe, feel-
ings are older than sensations, the
pi mitive forms of mental life are

retained, and these basic emo-
tions play an important part in every-
day life.

Professor Ruckmick has had charge
of the research work in objective
registration of emotions at the uni—
versity for the last 10 years.

ities acts will depict phases of Grin-
ncll history, was sug ested as an al-
tel‘native.

Buildings of the dormitories and
the quadrangle cottages will draw for
pairings as has been the custom here-
tofore. Each pair may choose the
organization which its act will repre-
sent and write its own parody. satire,
music, and plan the act. Sigma Delta
Chi approved the arrangement Thurs»

Social Probation Enforced:
New Freshman Training

Council Formed

Eight lllcll were placed on so»

llllllse‘ council (in week as a cone
(intuition of the investigation of
elllllpu‘ liquor conditions.

_ Cl‘ '1; hall, in, addition to hand-
ling the present situation in this
fashion, established a special
court of uppel‘cldssmen who will
ill the future direct freshmen in
the hall in social courtesy and will
tulle over personnel training in
regard to new men.

Train Freshmen

This training plan, new in Grinnell
dormitory life, will deal with all
phases of freshman activities, An ef-
fort will be made to see that each
freshman becomes a well rounded
member of the student body.

The council of house chairmen
Monday decided to leave continuance
of the liquor investigation in the
hands of councils in each building.
One other building of the dormitories,
where there has been no liquor
trouble during the year, placed two
men on social probation. Three others
were warned in the presence of the
house council and told that if any
further evidence were found against
them stricter measures would be rak.
en.

Two Scicre Cases

Of the eight men placed on social
probation in Clark hall, two will have
no social privileges at all until the end
of the semester. They will not be
permitted to have dates either dur—
ing the day or at night nor will they
be allowed to attend female or open
houses.

The other six men will be on the
same probation with the exception of
weekends. The rest of the men who
admitted their guilt in the probe.
have been placed on probation for
conduct for the rest of the year. In
the presence of the house council,
these men have promised active co»
operation in improving building liv-
ing conditions.

Quadrangle to Ctr-operate

The house council will be responsi~
ble for enforcement and supervision
of the penalties. Cooperation of the
women's self government league and
the dean of women will he asked in
this enforcement.

Three of the Clark hall men in—
volved are still under consideration
for dismissal from college at the end
of the semester. Final decision will
depend upon their conduct and
scholastic standing. Penalties on the
other men will be made more severe
if they fail to co»operate.

Yuletide Spirits
Fused to Form
Modern Holiday

Two Christmas sp s have fused
to form the modern Christmas cele-
bration, according to Cecil F. Lavell.
professor of history of thought, who
spoke at the Christmas convocation
in chapel Friday morning, The
Christmas celebrated by France and
Italy and by Catholic Americans in
honor of the birthday of the Christ
child has become interwoven with
the Yuletide of joy and merriment as
celebrated in the northern world of
yesterday.

All holidays, according to Mr. La~
vell, spring from an inner spirit, and
the Yule became enriched when join»
ed with Christmas. Yule was the
northern world's welcome to the
turning of the seasons and the birth
of a new year, while Christmas is
the homage paid to the birth of man-
kind.

“Christmas should be,” Mr, Lavcll
concluded, “an eternal ringing of
bells, a reminder and a summons."
It leaves behind all that is bad and
burdensomc and makes for a new
start.

Music was furnished by the vcspcr
choir singing “What Child Is This”
and "God Rcst You Merry Gentle-
mall", both from the Old English.

 

Harald Holst, instructor in Voice,
sang “Three Kings", (Cornelius).
