National Advertiser

by Debbie chase

The April and May editions oi
Ebony magazine will include a tulle
page advertisement designed to
recruit black studenls to Grinnell
College. The campaign. which
marks the first college advertise-
ment ever to appear in a national
magazine features Herbie Hans

graduate oi the college

Floyd Akin. admissions director
for minority aiiairs. thought of the
idea over a year ago alter seeing
an article in Ebony on l-lancock.
After a phone call to Hancock's
agent and a letter by Waldo Walker
asking ior the musician's support.
Hancock and the magazine agreed
to run the ad at cost The entire
package cost Grinnell 322,990, Akin
said he believes the price was so
low because Ebony believes that
this ad will spark a potentially
large and proiitable market as
other colleges pIL'k up on Gl'innell's
idea, ”We've opened up a whole
new can of worms,” he said

Designed by Jim Powers,
graphics designer tor the public
relations oiilce ol Grinnell, the ad
is being run in an chart to raise the
awareness 0i Grinnell In the black
community and thus make the
traditional recruitment techniques
more .eilective. “Many
metropolitan areas, such as Mem-
phis. Washington o.c.. and
Philadelphia don't know that Grin-
nell exists." Akin said. “We need a
medium to reach a large black
population, and_there's no,better

one than Ebony because it reaches
all social and economic groups,
from the big businesses to the
lower classes."

Akin Said that with the help of
the ad. he hopes someday to raise
the number or black applicants to

Akin. the number has Increased
irom i7 applicants tor the tall or
1987 lo 67 for the tall of 1988.

The dilliculty in recruiting black
students Stems from lack of
knowledge about Grinnell and a
limited number of qualified blacks
available, according to Akin
"We're competing with the ivy
League and with other very well
known colleges, such as Williams
and Swarthmore," Akin said, He
also cited the difficulty oi attracV
ting black, urban students to Iowa.
3 rural "allrwhlte" state.

By advertising a predominantly
white school in a black magazine,
Grinnell College shows its commit
ment to recruiting black students.
said Richard Ridgeway. director
of public relations at Grinnell,
“We're not just saying we want
more black students on campus."
said Akin, “We're saying we‘re gar
mg to do something about it."

Although the April issue of
Ebony does not reach the
newsstands until March 22. the col-
lege has already increased its ex
posure. The Wall Street Journal
reported on the campaign in its
