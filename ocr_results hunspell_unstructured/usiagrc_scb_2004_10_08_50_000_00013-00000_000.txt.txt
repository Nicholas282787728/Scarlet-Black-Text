Letters to the Editor

 

 

Let’s get along

Responding to several of last week’s letters
to the editor:

Given any student on campus. I would
gucss I could find some subject about which
said student and I disagree, and probably seine
subject about which we disagree strongly It
might be something political, it might be
something cultural, it might be something
social, or ethical, or theological, or academic,
or college-policy—centeied, or entirely trivial
I considered giving an example of a possibly
controversial bclicf for each of the above, rCr
considered, and thus will limit myself to: D59
is the best Star Trek,

My point here is that people disagiee. It’s
natural, it’s to be expected, it's to be desired.
We have no right to demand conforniitywlicn
we ourselves decline to conformThis means
that we really have to show some tolerance and
acceptanceThe fact of the matter is, no matter
how you feel about someonc‘s position, thcrc
is probably someone out there who feels the
same thing, just as strongly, just as sincerely,
about youis. And in my opinion, it is often
very hard to state with absolute, objective cer-
tainty who is right and who is wrong.

You find objective certainty in sciencc
(F na, water is composed ofhydrogen and ex
ygen, math rules!) but very seldom elsewhere.
Even internal consistency is bar-d to find, very
few pcopltrron any part oftlic political slicer
ttumrrhave an adamantinc, pcrfecrlv formed
itlcologv. Everyone is inconsistent. This doesnt
mean I dont believe in the possibli controver-
sial opinions I llludcd to above, Ijust think I
can permit opposing viewpoints to exist, and
occasionally shocking as it might seem, intcn
act peaceably With those who hold them

You see,l may think you re completely in—
sane to claim Enterpiise' is better than DS9,
but that doesnt mean We cant be friends and
have a perfectly rational conversation about
East Campus architecture. You may think l m

insane to support substlnce frcc housing, but
that doesnt mean we dont agree politically.

One persons kitsch is another person’s cnr
tertainment, one person’s gieat art is another
person’s gateway to severe depression, one
person's geeky obsession is another person's
way of life, I may think it’s very frightening
that there are people trying to remove my right
to control the contents of my internal organs,
but that doesn‘t mean they're bad people. Con-
servative Christians asa ablock terrify me. The
only conservative Christian I knew personally
was a very sweet higlrschool classmate, (She
preferred Next Generation.)

Not everyone, I realize, is prepared to
avoid controversial topics in order to maintain
friendships. Yes, it can get very grating. And
yes, someone needs to take a stand on scrious
issues, or the llotrllcccssal‘ilyrbad people may
implement thcii not-necessaiily-objectively-
incorrect views to the detriment of, at least,
nle~and whose bright idea was it to make It
so you cant buy meals with Dining Dollars,
anyway? But while I will fol the moment,
hold oﬁ' on the subject 0 fighting tire with
iii-,e the advent of it new Student gloup calls
for reasoned discussion and debate, not time
calling in ALL CAPS. I'm pierchoice. I agree
that the world is and has been really frelling
unfaii. However:

l,“Bccomlng a monster in order in destroy
a monster is not a productive longrtcrm Struts
egy."rr me

2. “Why can‘t we alljust get aion >"

\Vcll?

No, G tell is not the real world. Instead
of trying to make it like thc real world, let's
maintain a certain level of respect and lnzltur
rity in oui arguments,

And please, for the love of sanity, do not
even bring up Star Wars vs. StarTrclt,

Dissent deﬁnes democracy

It is true that Democracy and Freedom of
Speech in America are not peifect systems,
but it is closeemillded people like Mr. Rotlk
stein that encourage and prolong their ongor
ing impairments. The “Defending Pi‘orLife is
Fascist"lcttcr to the editoi last week was filled
with the veryholes in foundation and evidence
that it so hypocritically condemned pro-life
activism for having. The letter is wcllrwtitteu
and persuasive, but it is bullshit.

The core of confusion
and my own misgivings
about his letter reveals itself
with cl clariﬁcation of the
actual prorlife/pmrchoice
debate, It is NOT: “Should
a mother have control over
her womb or not," but rath-

r'."1f a fetus is human as
some groups maintain, whose rights should we
protectitl'lc mothei s oi the fetus

In this sense, no matter which sides’ laws
get passed, someones rights/ideologies/morals
arc bcing trampled, (whether you agree with
those trampled morals or not), So presently, it
is the pttrlife advocates who are being forced
to accept the “singular idealist notions of self
and society," making pro-choice activists—by
last week’s definition—the fascists.

I am NOT saying that prerchoicc activists
are fascists. It is my belicfthat neither group is,
not are Env‘ironmentalists/Economists/Antir
Sweat Shop Acti ists/any other gioup that be—
lieves strongly in a certain moralistic ideology;
they arc not forcing their bclicrs on others, but
rather using fact and wellrrescarched evidence

morals."

No laws would be
necessary if everyone
held the same “notion
of life, identity, or

to demonstrate their point to opposition.

What kind ofa fool actually believes that
just because a group’s opinion docs not match
his/her own or that of the majority, that the
opinion cannot have “any grounding in actual
evidential accounts ofical life biology, philoso-
pby, or experience?" These opinions could not
hdve withstood the test oftime Without having
educated, wellrexperienced supporre arr/r
sides have rational defense.

OPINION. The veiy
meaning of the word should
make it clear that no matr
ter how certain a member of
an opinionated (in this case,
pro-choice or pro-life) group
is of his/her convictions, the
other side has seen evidence
that conVlnces them to her
licve the exact opposue, Therefore, until a
iesolution can be found, the two sides must be
treated with l‘tife't'l, regardless of whether they
make you change your stance on the issue.

The prerchoicc group mu] the prerlife
group are ﬁghting for im/ rights as May see
them, for you are not the endrallrsayrall. Not
everyone agrees with either of the groups’itle~
ologies, which is why laws arc passed to en-
force what has been deemed the majority's
present opinion.

No laws- would be necessary if everyone
held the same “notion oflifc, identity, or more
als,” but this is simply not the case. It’s not
fascism, It’s democracy.

Disputing pro-life myths

For the pasi two weeks, I have read with
interest the various edltullals, letters, and [1111*
dom rants concerning the pio—life group, of
which I am one of the leaders.

This letter is not meant to speak for the
group or for any other preclife person other
than myself. 1 am writing because my position
has been continuously misrepresented alld I
feel it is time for the views of the othei side to
be heald. Ms. Malinowski, I did not help start
a group to take away peo-
ple's rights, but to educate
a onersidcd campus on the
other side ofan issue,

Mr. Rothstein, pro—
life fr a legitimate point of
view, and contrary to your
colorful history lesson (the
word “hysteria" comes to
mind to desciibc it), it is
mil fascism.

I also question your "facts," because the
number otwomcn who are raped is certainly
not3 outof4,butprobab1v closer to 1 mo. We
arcnt as victimized as you think Fuithermore,
the criteria you cite for being considered ac e
dcitlically rclcvant" (cohcrent point, tucaningr
an evidence...) is lacking in your own article.

And Ms. Chesnut, what 15 tolelailce if not
showing respect for the opinions of others, be
they politicil, social, or rcligions> l, ioo, .im
stlilding up lol my beliefs, and Inl not asking
van to be happy about the Pro Life Group Im
Its-king for the same amount of respect that the
campus Democrats deserve tiom the campus
Repiiblicai ,or that you, Mr. Roilrsrcin (his
threats ofviolcncc nonvithstanding), and Ms,
Malinowski deserve from me and my group.

IfGrinnclllans passively accept intolerance
and repression of unpopular positions, then
how sad it will be when we are faced with a
world ofdifference to live in,wherc you can be
sure to find someone who disagrees with the
issues you feel most strongly about r governs
ment, God, morals. I’m sotly Mr. Rothstein,
but hccldmg and physical violence only go so
far in sch ng coiirlicts.

At a college like Grinnell 1 would hope
that taking an unpopular position would res
sillt in ci 1 debilfc, educated discussion, and
opcn minds, not cditorials involving the words
“SILENCING " “BULLSHIT,” and "flscist."
With that said, listen up, Glinncll because if
you want to disagiee with me, disagicc With my
educated bcllels, not my resolve to be heard.

i believe in a woman's right to choosc to
have so. and to take responsibility for her at
tions, According to the Center for Disease
Control, about 46% of women who have abort
tions are not having their first one. This is not
being responsible, nor is it good for a woman's
body, I bclicve in science, and that a fetus’s
heart begins to beat after 18er days, and

minds.

At a college like Grinnell,
[would hope that
taking an unpopular
position would result in
civil debate, educated
discussion, and open

that the brain begins functioning after about
8 weeks.
I believe that the number of women who
pregnant from rape is too small to be a le~
imate reason for abortion to be legal in all
cases. I believe that concern for the life of the
mother, which again accounts for only a tiny
percentage of abortions, is the only reason to
justify abortion. Unlike many prerlife people, I
believe in the morning after pill as an accept—
able option. I also believe
that abortion is not a per-
sonal choice that should bc
left to indi duals, just as
murder (to use the obvious
example) is not.

Furthermore, I believe
that to expend time and en-
ergy into fighting for aborr
tion “rights" is detrimental
to women and society. Even
for those who suppoit it, abortion should be a
last iesort (shouldn’t it?). Rather than fighting
for this last resort, we should be fighting for
better health care. better availability of corn
traceptives, better domestic abuse prevention,
better selfrdefcnsc tiaining for women, bet—
ter education, bettei rape counseling, better
distribution ofthc mol'iliilgraftct pill to rape
victims or others who need it, bettcl‘ support
for single or struggling mothers, more efficient
adoption iegulations, more laws regarding dis-
ciimination against mothers in the workplace
and in schools, dud so OILTl‘lCSB are the things
that will empower women and give thcm conr
trol over their bodics, not abortion.

Women should be trying to prevent the
need for aboltions in the first place, rather
than promoting them as a valuable “choice"
when one becomes pregnant,

In sum, 1 don't expect to change anyone's
mind about abortion. but I sincerely hope that
I can change the stereotypes surrounding the
position, Too many people here think that
they should be safe and unquestioned in their
four years of college; that they should be sur
rounded only by people who agree with thcm;
that different (less “liberal"l viewpoints do not
need to be considered. If you want that sort
of comfort, then you should not be at an in-
stitution that encourages students to think for
themselves.

I accept that many people here disagree
with me,and if they have thoughtroutand tear
sonablc arguments against my position then I
can accept our differences without compromis-
ing my own stronglyrheld beliefs, 1 will not,
however, sit quietly while my position is being
baselessly and immaturely attacked. Step up
the level ofdcbate and show me whyI should
listen to you and take you seriously, and I will.

Let’s keep coke on campus

To the authors of“Send Coke offCanlpus":
how about NOT sending coke off campus?
You claim that“Gtinnell College has a history
as in internationally-informed and socially-
aware institution." However,

doings stem trom (1) a limited coke supply and
(2) a corrupt coke distribution system. There-
fore I propose that SGA provides r'unding to
address both issues, By utilizing the Noyce

Science Centers greenr

you fail to realize that Grinr
nell College also has a history
as a cokevlovmg institution,
Grinnell students love—dare
I say nccduthcir Cot-c. I
love coke. Mitch Herz loves
coke, Wlly then should we
get lid of it?

You correctly assert that

We could organize an
anti-coke boycott. But
why deny when we
could supply? Now

is the time for self
governance to shine.

house and organic chemisr
try labs, Crinnell students
could ensure a fair, system-
atic and (most of all) may
coke supply.

So my point is simple:
we could organize an anti—
coke boycott. But why deny
when we could supply?

“humin rights violations committed by [coke]
violate the spirit and trust ofthe Grinnell Col-
lege community" But I bclicve thcsc wrong-

Now is the time for selfrgovcrnance to shine.
