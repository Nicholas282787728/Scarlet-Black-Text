tion of housing rules, the Grinnell Committee
for Student involvementi

1966-7 was probably the apex nistudentpro-
test over housing matters. SKtB's were iilled
with articles concerningjours. I-V's (inter-
visitation) and the sexual morality oi Grlnr
nell students. IN November nineteen mem-
bers of AWS, CoiHP, and the Executive Cabr
inet participated in a violation oi I~V regur
latlons in Gates Hall, alter announcing their
intention to do so beiorean assemblyol 700
students, The culmination oithe year’sactl»
vities was the publication in the last paper at
the year oi an open letter to theGrinnell comr
munity Signed by approximately seventy stu-
dentsY who admitted their Violations oi I-V
regulations and suggested increasingly open
dorms. The letter stated that the administra*
tion could either open up dorms or force stu-
dents to seek out “cold and wet" goli courses
or “expensive and inconvenient" motels or
allow public displays (“Would any single per
son venture into the South Lounge aiter10:30?)

1967-8 was important {or one big reason"
Grinnell women had been liberated irom the
tyranny oi hours. ,

1968-9 was another big year. kicked off by
the Schneirov case In late September, a girl
was found living in the room Oi student Rich-
ard Schneirov, a resident of Loose Hall.
Although he had been warned and told to ask
the girl to‘leave or tace the consequences, the
girl, a non—Grinnellian, stayed and Schneirov
iorced the administration to take a stand on
IvV's during his trial. Alter a Judicial Council
trial beinre 400 students, the Council found
him guilty at violating existing regulations,
and President Leggett sentenced him to con-
duct probation and expulsion irom college
housing tor the remainder oi the year,

This defeat ior the student movement was
immediately iollowed by a student reierendum
in which 53% oi the student body expressed
support oi complete hall autonomy in IrV's
President Leggett was quick to respond tothe
mounting display oi student sentiment; he
soon announced quhour open lounges and hall
autonomy on er’s within an 84-hour per
week limit.

The same year men were found for the first
time on South Campus and women on North
Campus (Younkers was co-ed by wing) and an
end to administration guidelines on quiet
hours.

in 1970-1 the 84-hour per week restriction
was titted, thus ending all administration
regulation of the matter. There was also
an increase in the number oi coed dorms,

The proposed housing changes this year
are iairly wmearanging. They include the
abolition oi the quota system in room draw,
an increase in the number of coed halls, and
some modifications oi black housing
arrangements. All the proposals are tentar
tive and must be acted on by the Social
Policies Committee and the Joint Boards,
and then by Burling basement.

The Social Policies Committee, a part oi
the Committee A structure, has set up two
housing subcommittees, the SGA Housing
Committee and the Black Housing Commit
tee. The SGA committee is concerned with
all campus housing; the black housing com-
mittee meets with the SGA committee when
matters relevant to black housing are dis
cussed. One member oi the black housing
committee, Celestine Bloomlield, meets
regularly with the SGA committee asanon-
voting member These two subcommittees
will submit a mutual report to the Social
policies Committee, or, it they disagree,
two separate reports.

The Black Housing Committee has pre-
sented a CBS housing proposal to the SGA
Committee, The SGA Committee has agreed
to two oi its principal stipulations, although
details have not yet been determined,

These are the general proposals the SSA
committee will present to the Social Poli-
cies Committee; as oi this writing:

The modification oi the existing cluster
system in Younkers to a series of Clusters
involving several other dorms,

A black co-op tor 13 people in what is
now Conierence House. This was anadminr
istrption decision, representing a commit-
ment made during the negotiations last (all.

An increase by one hall in the number oi
coed dorms As the proposals now stand,
there will be only [our single-sex dorms
next year, all on North campus,

The abolition oi the quota system ior ups
perclassmen.

An onrcampus group»drziw program which
can accommodate 40 people

With regard to the on-campus group draws,
the committee will recommend that

nawson i be blocked on tor a group oi two
women; Gates 1 tor 3 melt; Smith annex
for 12 men, Dibble nnnex ior 11 women;
the RA suite in Mears for 4 people; the
James house president's suite ior 3, the
Cowles RA suite for 3, and the Main house
mother’s suite [or Z

All areas ioi- group draw have private
liaths, and in the Mears RA suite there is
a kitchenette as well.

The group draw will be some time prior
to the overall room draw. interested groups
can compete ior only one group area. That
is, a group can be in the draw tor any one
of the above blockedroii areas. but only ior
one. There are no second chances.

Also, all dn-campus groups will be re—
quired to be on SAGA.

The quota system will be abolished insoiar
as it applies to upperclassmen. Rooms tor
70—30% oi the new students will still be
blocked on, however, to insure a distribu-

'tion oi treshmen

Except tor the two points noted above, no
agreement has been reached on the CBS
proposal. CBS did however make thetollow»
ing suggestions to the SGA committee:

That the cluster system now existing in
the Ynunkers be modihed to a cluster sySr
tem which will include, on North campus,
Younkers, Smith, Langan, Rawson, and Dibr
pie, The clusters in these halls will work
like the one now in Younkers, except that
they will be smaller
That there be a “secondary c1uster"sys~
tem on south campus, to include Loose,
Main, James, and Cleveland. According to
Celestine Bloomiield, only 6-8 blacks are
expected to live on south campus nextyear,
The “secondary Cluster” system is der
signed to insure that a black lreshmnn can
live in a dorm with at least one other black
person. However, this is not exactlyaclus-
ter system, since the upperclnssman may
not even be on the same iloor as the tresh-
man.

The committee has not yet made it recom—
mendations on corops and proiect houses
(except tor the black co-op), nor has it der
cided when room draw will be. However,
James Tederman, chairman oi the SGA
housing committee and Asst. Dean Distu-
dents, said his target date ior room draw
was mid-April.

The College will also attempt to assist
students desiring on campus housing, but
it has not decided how it will do that yet.
