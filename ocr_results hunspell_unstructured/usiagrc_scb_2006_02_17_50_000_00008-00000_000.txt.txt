My introduction to public nudity occurred while

When we were innocently strolling past the Old

I let out a gasp/shriek

While I covered my eyes with both hands in on are

sadly mistaken."

Four and a half months later,
as a week-old Grinnell student, I
stood trembling on the Les Duke
track, wearing nothing but my New Balance sneaks
ers. '

A congregation of unelorhed Grinnellians—a
throng of boobs and nipples, crotches and bulges,
cheeks and cracksiraced once around the track, arms
and legs pumping, breasts and penises bouncing and
ﬂapping on their own accord. I was among them.

Had I simply succumbed to peer pressure of the
“takeroffrallryourrc1othesrbutrnotrasrarprecursorr
for-sexual-activity—or-taking-a-shower"variety?

The answer is yes and no.

I will admit thatl certainly would not have made
it to the track that night with intent to undress had
it not been for the coaxing ofa new friend. But after
the initial bout ofvcrbai persuasion, an intense feeling
of comfort and understanding swept over me. oncel
stepped foot on the track, I knew the act of running
naked was something I wanted to experience.

My decision to strip did not result from a desire
to fit in with my new friends or to rebel from the
social norms of my suburban upbringing. I did not
feel pressured to participate and I did not feel violated
while doing so.

My decision resulted from the realization tharjust
because ceitain body parts are used in actiVities rang
ing from excretion to intercourse, does not mean that
these parts should bring shame. It stemmed from a
quiet understanding that yes,I have breasts, and yes.
I am not a supermodel, but no, I was not going to be
embarrassed about my body any longer.

Having spent too many of my

high school days worrying about

the curve of my belly becoming too curvaceous and

my non-bootylicious rear end, I eventually tired of
such destructive thinking.

During my senior year of high school, I vowed to
do away with scales.To do away with wondering how
I looked in form—ﬁtting running clothes. And since
coming to Grinnell, l’ve —
vowed to sometimes do

. away with clothing.

Everyone has dif—
ferent ways to cope
with body image, but
I’ve found that sporadic
cally running in the buff
works for me.

And I’m thankful
that I belong to a school
community that mesh—
es well with my newly
found intermittent naked urges.

But what did my mother, the one who had all too
recently seen me squirm at the sight of bare bodies,
have to say about my new lifestyle?

When she called last finals week to see what I was
up to,I replied not with typical cnd ofthc year griping
but with a casual, “Um .. . I just ﬂew a kite naked on
Mac Field in the snow.”

There was along pause on the other end.

Finally she replied calmly with a smirkI could hear
in her voice through the phone: “I told you Grinneli
was the school for you.”
