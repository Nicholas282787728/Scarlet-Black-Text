A COMMUNICATION.

1h). scanner .lxo BLACK-

Last spring the iaciilty representa
tivesfroni some liitcen colleges and
unire . ies in Iowa assembled in
Grinnell for the alleged purpose of
odoptinga uniiorin set of eligibility
rules governing Iowa intercollegiate
athletics. Considering the varied
character of the institutions interest-
ed it was freely predicted that only a
“few of the best” would subscribe to
to really eilective regulations. To the
surprise ofmany the conference was
quite harmonious. There prevailed,
seemingly, a genuine desire for reform.
In fact, the representatives outdid
their “Big Nine” conference brethren
and agreed to recommend to their re-
spective institutions a one yern's resi-
(lance rule, thereby exhibiting a spasm
oryirtue exceeded in terror only by
the men who positively declares every
Saturday night that he has taken his
last drink. Not one school adopted
the year rule; butoi‘ that no matter.
What does matter is that, lawn, Drake
and Amos have adopted the confer-
ence regulations and that we along
with all the rest. “welcher .”

It has been .1 boast 101‘ many years
within Grimieli’s iainily circle. that
the college has sucriliced a fat enroll-
ment on the altar of a high education-
al standard. That the conduct of our
athletic sports has not been inainbainr
ed on it similiar pi‘due lrils often at-
tributed to the lack of more direct
and thorough faculty control. The
various faculties had the v innings,

The most couspicuoiisienture or the
game was the continual line Smashing.
Both Sides used it almost exclusively
ior it Seemed the surest \l'ay to gain.
Des Moines‘ tandem formation oi the
backs was especially eiiectual, until
poor line \vorlf somewhere would allow
Lile ball to be downed back of the
line.

It was a good game to watch and ex-
ceptionally clean nothing but, good
feeling being in evidence at any time.
Des Moines put in no substitutes
While Griuneil used two, each team
showing good [arm and condition.
Every man in the game played his
best and deserves great credit.
