The Dramatic club presented
“Brown or Harvard" at the Colonial
theater last evening pcloro a large
and enthusiastic audience. This play
might just as well be called “Brown
oi Princeton," or “Brown or Grinllell'
(were it not tor the look or facilities
hereabouts ior aquatic sports) as to
tag it with the‘name of America's Ollie
est university. It is lacking in, but
not wholly devoid or, local color and
some of the scenes are iinpossihle in
Cambridge. For instance, a discreet
young woman never appears- in the
yard at Harvard unaccompanied by an
escort, However, it does give a fairly
diverting picture of college lite in
general and the audience was well on-
tertained, demonstrating its approval
generously. As a realistic picturc oi
college events, “Brown of ’Iarvdl‘d”
is iar from perfect, it does not come
pare with “The College Widow" in tl
matter of humor, ant “Stronghenr
surpasses it in local color and inten-
sity of interest, The play is well
worth seeing and another opportiinit;

evening, January 14, when it will be
repeated. The plot hinge. on an ins
conceivable sci. of actions. The

gives him a check tor $100. Kenyon
forges another with Brown's name
for $300, payable to Marion, which he

disloyal graduate who places hi‘s bets
on the Engl h crew and endeavors to
cause Harvar 's defeat by handing to
Thorpe, just as the crew are about to
embark in their shell. a letter stating
that at that moment Tnarne‘s sister
is about_to leave town under compro-
mising circumstances. Thorne refuses
to row and rushes out to ﬁnd his sis-
ter; Brown is substituted and much
to the surprise and delight of his
iriends ilarvard wins the race. not-
withstanding the absence or Thorpe.
The ﬁnish oi the race forms the CH»

are cleared away. and notwithstand-
ing slight complications caused by the
active competition of “Happy" Thurs-
thn. Kenyon is forgiven by Brown,
who destroys the iorged check.

The settings were excellent, the ins
terior in Acts 1, and 1v. and the Dal»
(oily or the boat house bcing particue
larly realistic and eiiectivc. The cos-
tuniing was pleasing and adequate.
The stage management was creditable
and the action was exceptional ~apid
for amateurs, dragging only slightly
in the hrst act while the tea was in
magi-asst

The parts were well cast. Mr. Lyon
ins Tom Brown did a very Consciellr
tious and in the main satislying piece
0' work. He played with sinceiity and
was especially convincing in the more
serious moments. in the lighter
scones he employed slightly too much
movement or the body and his facial
expression was not always good. But
on the whole his characterization was
ellective, showing careful study. He
delivery of the lines was exceptionally
clear. Mr. Turner gave an excellent
interpretation oi Gerald Thorpe. He
has a tendency to deciaim his lines
at timcs, but he erred infrequently in
this direction last night and his cha-
acterization stood lorth for its dirccte
ness and manliiicas, He loolietl his
part admirably ,

Miss Alma Van bike as Evelyn Ken—e
you, brought a pleasing stage presence
to the part. She read her lines with
piquaucy or expression and humor.
.l \l‘iley as Marion Thorpe had
rather a teaiiul and thankless part.
but her treatment oi it was vci adei
quote and carellll. Miss Einns as Mrs,
Kenyon gave it oatsiy ig portrayal
or the cliapcron in Act 1. and ot the
drier—stricken mother in Act lit, when
her son coutrsses that he is the cause
