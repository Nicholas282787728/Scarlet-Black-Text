a battle of intellect. Such is the
record oi the evening the tenth oi
Marchintheyem-oi Grace 190.; as it
wrll go downin history. It is indecdl
to be regretted that the only fact in
the case which appeals on the suriuce
to the outside observer is the r g

ness or those three ballots against
Iowa College and that the iuture, at
leastsoiarasthosc who did not at-
tend the debate are concerned, will
have no other standard by which to
,judge the issue beside that adverse
unanimous decree. ' It is to be re-
gretted, letit be said, because such
cold and uncompromising facts tell all
too little or the skill and energy which
ioughton the losing side. Only one

consideral ion can be invoked in tr)”
ing to gather the crumbs or corniort:
that the judges. though agreeing in

their re .ittL, could not possibly be
impressed so decisively as the count
would indicate. For those that heard
the debate and followed closely the
line of argument on both sides itls
almost impossible to escape such a
conclusion, Unanimity of opinion
among three or any other number of
judges is possible on the basis of mar»

The delegate convention has lost its

Mr. iioor‘e rollowed with the ﬁrst
argument for the negative. The quits»

all the voters to cost intelligent bal-

the voters know nothing oi the candi—

the resultant of COIllpi'olnise;ztnd corn-

The direct primary isa radical ven-
ture and would laclr stability. Mr.
Moore's speech is ilnent and eliective.

Second to Speitk 0n the afﬁrmative
was Cliﬂ‘otd H. Brown. who opened
his argument by calling attention to
and emphasizing the negatives argu-
ment that WE want it representative
government. The farther removed

Personality is the issue. not. party

inthe proposed system and its adop-

breakdown oi the party system.

Mr. \Voi‘tli whose every appearance
in debate husshown improvement in
reasoning and in delivery, was next to
appcar. The party system is theiound-
ation ot_,the American government.
The pi nary rosters the party system
by prese mg harmony within. In the
convention system the boss is the
supreme pouer. parties are needed to
promote the cooperation oi voters,
to get the best men tor the oliices. to
crystallize public opinion and put it
before the people. Under the canyon-
tion system oi nominating. theolllcers
who are elected are not responsible to
the people.

Thedirectmrgument oi the evening
was now tnished by Mr. ILJ. Smalley,
who was later _to talre the long
end oi the negative rebuttal.
The convention system. Mr. Smalley
contended. is not the cause or boss
rule. The proposed plan would en-
courage the spoils system, cheapen
suiirage and multiply opportunities
for volebuying. The causes ror boss
rule, insorar as they lie within the
convention system, may be eliminated
by puriiying election machinery. It
is unnecessary to confuse the voter by
placing large numbers or names betore
him, and such an eliecl. is always
a sure incidental or the primary
system, We are now assured or no
minority candidates but the new sys—
tem uould make them possible.

speakers inclined a triile toward the

decision went to the negative because

make vulnerable their argument. It
