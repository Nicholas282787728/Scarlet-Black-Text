fact that the writers of the modern
school are all comparatively young

and that the majority are college
graduates. "Current poetry of to-day
in general reﬂects the unrest oi the
times," stated Rev. Patton and he add
on that there is very little verse writ-
ten at the present time on the prob»
lems of life or of Christ. To illus—
tratethe tendency of modern verse he
