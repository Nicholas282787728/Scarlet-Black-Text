The Music
of Java

By Laura .Jarvis ,
A Javanese gamelan. or orchestra. is
made up of about 35 primarily percussion
instruments such as large tuned gongs and
xylophones. Professor of Music Robert
Vetter, an ethnomusicologist specializing
in non~Western music, has added the
music or Java, one oi the many islands
that make up Indonesia, to the scope
covered by Grinnell’s music department

Vetter became interested in gamelans
while he was studying Asian ensembles at
the University oi Hawaii, which has an ex-
tensive enihnomusicology department He
received both a BA. in education and an
MA. in music theory from the University
of Hawaii, and went on to earn a PhD. in
ethnomusicology irom the university of
Wisconsin at Madison.

For two years, Vetter studied music in
Java, and while he was there, he commis»
stoned his own gamelan and watched as it
was built in his backyard. _

Vetter stresses that each gamelan is one
of a kind, since each of the instruments in
the set is tuned to match the others. “If
there were another gamelan in Grinnell, I
couldn't take the other instruments and
mix them with mine," said Vetter. “In
Java, the gamelan is treated as though it
were an individual. It's a very special anti-
0,.”

In (act, each gamelan bears a name;
Vetter's is called Kyai biwara, which
means "venerable herald.”

“Gamelans are generally not owned by
just anyone. They’re generally owned by
rich individuals. institutions, or
factories," said Vetter.

Gamelans are an integral part or
Javanese culture. “Instead of a bowling
league, in Java, you have a gamelan club.

to see all oi its chairs requesting salaries.

Concerts chair Jim Asplund and Films
chairKevln O‘Prey argued that their jobs
were different from those of other chairs
and that.the time requirement was much
greater, A letter from Activlties Counselor
Georgia Dental was read that defended the
chairs salaries because they were in
creative positions. Dental implied that the
positions required special skills which
were deservtng of compensation

Joint Board ruled decisively in lavor of
reinstating the two salaries for a total of
$125 per semester, The entire budget will
be up for approval at next weeks meeting,

1n the last ten to 15 years, the status 01
women in Java has changed," said Vetterr
“Women now have a number of clubs
whose tunction is playing the gamelan,"
At Grinnell, Vetter is now making it
possible for students to participate in a
gamelan ensemble. No prior musical ex
perience is necessary, because “the
gamelan presents students with very little
technical challenge. The real challenge
lies in developing understanding oi how
the music is structured,” said Vetter.
Because several groups in the Us have
recently taken the gamelan out of its
musical conteit, Vetter points out that his
group plays traditional musical and
“adheres as closely as possible to the
Javanese style and manner of pertor-
mance."
An informal concert at the end of the
semester and a formal concert next spring
are tentatively Slated. Vetter said mat he
hopes to incorporate dance into the spring
program, since his wife, Valerie, is an’en-
ﬂlusiast of Javanese dance. Although its
instrumentation is nearly iull, anyone with
a strong interest in the gamelan may still
contact Vetter.
