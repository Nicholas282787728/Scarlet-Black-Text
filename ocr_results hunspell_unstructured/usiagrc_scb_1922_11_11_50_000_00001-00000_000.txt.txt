Convention IS Featured lay Practical Adv
Given by Speakers — Best Meeting of
High School Association.

The awarding of the three cups this noon closed the last official session
of the third annual meeting of the state High School
Attended by one hundred ninety delegates representing tunty-ight high schools

Prcss convention.

this cont‘mion was by far the nrost successful of the three which have been
held in Grinneil.

a program featured by practical advice was git-on to the high school
journalists. George S. Stone, or the Chicago Daily News, opened the discus-

sion of journalism yesterday afternoon by an outline of the Doss

ilities of a
futtrre in that ﬁeld. Robert l'Cerr. associate editor of the American Lumber-man,
followed with a‘ discussion of high school magnaiies.
(lien tallied on the Value of ﬂight

Arthur Brayton then

School journalism. The meeting this
morning was divided into two sections
in which there were interesting round
tables for the discussion of topics es—
pecially interesting to the High School
journalists.

Mr. stone, instructor in Medlll
School of Journalism, and member of
the editorial staff at the Chicago
Daily News, addressed the convention
on "Practical Ideals of Reporting.”
Mr. stone discouraged journalism as;
a ﬁnancial enterprise but favored it
as a means of a good, honest uvingtl

"There is no ﬁeld for a phlegmatic ‘
or dogmatic type of writer, who is a
socialist or has only partisan ideas,"
he said, “a paper requires f‘kick” and
not merely cold logic of facts." It is
the readers who furnish the founda—
tion for newspaper prosperity. A
news item must be a statement of
true fact,and not the writers own
opinion. ‘

Course of Sndy. A

Mr. stone advised that the technical
part of journalism would follow the

‘trajning, and that ﬁrst a student
should attend a good Liberal Arts col~
logo, and then acquire prachcal ex
perience. The course of study, advis—
ed by Mr. Stone, for a good training
should consist of: fundamental prin—
Ciples of economics, study of govern
merit, law, sociology, history, and ii —
erature. Literature is of vital impor—
tance and requires a great deal of
writing and reading with a critical
eye." Journalism is not erratic or dis—
honorable, but honest and honorable.

Mr. Arthur Brayton, Editon of tho
Merchants Trade Journal, spoke on
the subject or “High School Papers
as a Training for Journalism." ivtr.
Brayion smted four main principles
in the writing of newspaper articles:
contact, accuracy, condensation and
simplicity.

Value of H. S. Papers.

"The High School newspaper brings
one in contact with people who are
leaders in social, civic and political
activities. It brings a wider acquain—
tance among friends, teachers and
leaders." '

"Despite the deadline, one must be
accurate in all newspaper work.
When making mistakes, a cheerful,
optimistic attitude makes the best
correction."

Mr. Braytcn said, "In order to culti—'
vate journalistic style one must bear
in mind the hug—bear of journalism:
unity, coherence and emphasis."

Using Arthur Brisbane as an ex-
smple,’ ilr. urayton advised that
"short sentences and paragraphs, and
simple words were essential to a good
piece of news writing." In summing’
up, he said, "service is the main idea
in Journalism, and quality, quantity.
and mode and manner of conduct are,
the essentials."

Purpose of Milgfizine.‘

Mr. Robert Kerr, Associate Editor
of the American Lurnborman, spoke
on the subject of “Magar c Editing
in the High School.“ Giving advise
to the embryo paper. llr. lccrr, “ad:
vised that as a matter of ﬁnance alll
illustrations should be omitted. All:
work entertained by contribution
should not be merely mediocre but of
the best caliber." Mr. Kerr state
three reasons for the purpose of the,
publication of a high school man—l
zine; for the rcal satisfaction of the
writers and readers, not a laboratory
to teach students to write and to cry— ,
stallizc the thought of the institution]
by voicing the expression and unifying ,.
force in the school community.” l

Gn'nnell AthletES Will Make
Desperate Attempt to Upset
Dope Bucket.

After the game today there remains
but one more contest on the Grinneil
football schedule~the Drake game. it
is, moreover, the most important game
of the season, and the one in which
the school is most interested. Because !
oi the intense rivalry between the two
schools, and because of its bearing on
the Missouri vauey Conference race,
the Grinneil coaches are already prim-
ing their men for the contest.

Drake is in the lead for the Chains
nionslrip of the valley, and, according
to Des Moilies sport writers, will ﬁn-
ish in the load. This the Grinneil
team will attempt to disprove. The
wiscacres point to the fact that Grin-
nell, regariess of her showing during
the football season, always shows up
to greater advantage at the Drake
gains than at any other. Wih the team
a team which can hold Ames to a 7 to
0 score, this saying will be doubly
true.

Alnes was defeated by Drake 14 to‘
7, the Ames touchdown being the res
suit of persistent ground gaining, a
feat which they were unable to ac-
carnpiish in their playing here. Grin»
nell should, by means of their pass—
iug, bucking and the new series of
plays, be able to gain much more con-
sistently than at any time previous
This will give them a considerable
ladvantage or-cr Aincs, which places
'them on a par with Drake. Given an
:even chance with the Bull-dogs, and
the Pioneer’s ﬁght will carry them on
to a wellseai'ned victory. and an even
’break in the Missouri Valley column.

Cornell. Backs Punch Grinnell Line for Big
Gains w Green Dropkicks from Twenty
Yards for Only Counter of Game.

Cornell thoroughly upset the Grinneil dope bucket and sprung a great
surprise on Grinneil fans by defeating Grinneil 3 to 0 in the game this after-
noon. Gl'innell was outplayed throughout the game, with the exception of a.
short time at the end of the second quarter and another spurt in the second
half, when they were able to make four successive ﬁrst downs. The Grinnell
line held at critical times, and several times turned back the Cornell attempts
for touchdown, so that Cornell was forced to drop kick in order to score.
The Cornell passing machine, Kirwin, Green, and Hartwell, were responsible
for many gains at critical points in the game. Cornell attempted over twenty
passes, and succeeded in completing ten of them for a total of over one

aid that Cornell was able to make their
four-teen ﬁrst downs while Grinnell
’rvas able to make only eight. The
game was marked by offside play, and
numerous penalties. Cornell was pen—
alized for a total of thirty-ﬁve‘yards,
w its Grinneil was set back sixty
yards. For Grinneil, Duke, Wood,
Nor-slurs, smith, and Kitchen were the
stars, while Hartwell, Kirwin, Sagle,
Greene, and For were the outstanding
men for the Mt. Vernonites. A steady
rain felt throughout the fourth quar-
ter. A large crowd witnessed the
game.

Using a combined rushing and aerial ‘
attack, Cornell swept the Pioneers off
their feet in the ﬁrst quarter of the
game. Three passes netted ﬁfty-four
yards for the Mt. Vernon aggregation
out of a total of eight atempted in the
ﬁrst half. Although momentarily sur-
nrised, by the strong Cornell tactics,
the Pioneers stiffened their defense
the latter par-t of the half, and mo—e
than outplayed their opponents. Kir-
w.n, speedy Cornell half, broke away
for several long end runs around the
right wing. Smith also broke away
for long gains through the Cornell
line. Two attempted drop kicks by
Greene and one by Hartwell went
wide. Both sides went scoreless for
the period, with Critchett and Owens
engaging in a punting’duel.
