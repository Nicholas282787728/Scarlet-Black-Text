LEGTURES GREATLY APPRECIATED

The second at his sci cs or lectures
on * lost Recent Literature . was
dcl cred in Chapel Monday by Rev.
Washington Gladden, on the subject,
"Recent English Poets iiutl Poetry,"
He discussed the pros and writings of
some oi the most iamous present-tidy
English poets. rind read several sclece
tioiis from the works at some or them

At the end 0! the nineteenth ceu.
tury." said Dr. Gladden ‘ihei’e was a
noticeable decline in thc , t of poet
Few poems were written. and iew writ—
Poetry
had declined because this was an age
of pi cal exploration. and the call
of the ﬁelds of science and discovery
was too urgent to permit the advance
or the art or poetry.

"But we are liiiiig today in .t dif»
iereiit atmosphere than that on which
[he nineteenth tentury dawned. A
political democracy built on industrial
reudaiism could not eh' t and the
spiritual and social awnlttining or the
ideal has involrcd a burst 01 song."

According Io Dr. Gladden. one ot the

it is this that our pacts tire helping

But perhaps the greatest voice that
we lien in the lyrics 0!. today is the
cry or democracy. a phase dealing uilh

has best grasped and expressed the
conviction that true democracy means
brotherhood in a poem a! the Bowe V.
which throws the truest light on the
ideal relation oi mankind.

The poem. "A Singing nan." b3
Josephine Preston Peabody. was called
by Dr. Gladden the noblest specimen
of modern American poetry, and one or
the noblest of any period at literature.
The writer at this poem. which was
read by the speaker. is already well-
