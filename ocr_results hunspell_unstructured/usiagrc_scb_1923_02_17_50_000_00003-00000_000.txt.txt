lKIDDER DEFINES
. SUCCESSFUL MAN

Des Moilies Speaker Emphasizes
Use of Natural Qualities.

The man who has good qualities of
leadership and the conﬁdence of the
community but who is timid, that is.
who fails to take a stand on a moral
issue. is the most dangerous man in
the community, according to w. H.
Kidder of Des Moines, who spoke on
"Choosing a Vocation" at the Y. M.
c. A. meeting Thursday evening.

“The truly successiul man in busi—
ness, or any other prniession, is the
one who knows how to invest his in-
herent qualities to the host advantage
of both himself and others," said Mr.
Kidder. Sin as deﬁned by the speaker.
is selﬁshness, and the selﬁsh man is
the one who has good qualities and
does not use them to help others.

The second or the series or voca-
tional talks will be on the “Law as a
Christian Profession" Thursday even-
ing at 7:00 o’clock in the Association
Building.
