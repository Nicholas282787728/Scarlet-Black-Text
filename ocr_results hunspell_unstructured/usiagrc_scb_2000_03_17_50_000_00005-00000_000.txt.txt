between high schools, colleges

By Molt Berger
U-WlRE Woshinglon Bureau

Education secretary Richard
Riley proposed creating a dialogue
between secondary school and
college leaders late last month as
part ofhis address on the State of
American Education.

Riley, speaking at a Durham,
NC. high school, said having two
systems ofeducation that do not
work together does not fit with
the modern era e an era that has
seen more people attending coir
lege than ever before.

“This crush of new students
comes atatimewhen manyofour
nation's colleges and universities
are already full and becoming
more selective in their admissions
process," Riley said. “This will
mean increasing pressure‘ror high
school seniors to get into the cole
lege of their choice,

He'urged university leaders to
get in touch with parents and stuv
dents, and praised Dennis Smith,
president of the University of
Nebraska, who sent a letter to
parents in the state outlining the
highschool classes students need
to take to prepare for college.

“We know that the transition
between high school and college
is a very critical time and can de
termine whether a student’s cole
lege experience will be successful,"
Riley said. “Early intervention

Strategies can go a long way to
reducing the cost ofremedial edue
cation, which now stands at a half
billion dollars a year."

Some states are implementing
new ways of gradauiion that are
tailored to higher education. In

The secretary also encouraged
plans to improve retention rates
among minority students in cole
leges and universities.

Riley used the forum to appeal
to Congress, asking them to im-

the come

cade,” he
said, “Burwe must also recognize
that higher education is breaking
out ofold boundaries.”

Riley said the education com-
munity must look at the quality
of online college programs, and
how students can garner financial
aid for those resources.

Riley said education, both on
the secondary and collegiate level,

starts with quality teachers. To
that end, he proposed making
tad-ling a yearetound occupation.

“This extra time can and
should be used for intensive pro—
fessional development, and it cere
rainly should be used to give more
students extra help they need in
the summer months,” he said.

uMore than a few school dis-
tricts already have their teachers
working ten months.”

He said he is concerned about
the pay gap between teachers and
Other professionals. Teachers with
masters degree make $32,000 less
than their counterparts in other
professions with the same level of
education.

Congressional Republicans
scoffed at Riley’s address, saying
it was ﬁlled with “unfulﬁlled
promises and missed opportuni-
ties.”

“Across our country, real edu»
cation reform and incrmses in stu»
dent achievement are taking place
in spite of the Clinton-Gore Ad-
ministration, not because of it,”
said Rep, Bill Goodling (Re
Penn.), chair of the House Come
mittee on Education and the
Workforce. “It saddens me to
think how much more could have
been accomplished at the state
and local level during the past
seven years had the administration
in Washington joined with Con-
gress in being more committed to
students than to teacher unions,”

Ofﬁcials at Grinnell College
are searching for a few good op
portunities for service fellowships
in Poweshiek County and d1e sur»
rounding area, and Doug
Curchins is wide open to sugges-
tions. i

Cutchins, director of the office
of social commitment, said the
college is seeking to form partner»
ships widt organizations that are
involved in work that is of tan-
gible benefit to others. The ser-
vice fellowships would be for re-
cent graduates of Grinnell Col-
lege.

Through this partnership, he
said, Grinnell College will pay for
one or two fellows’ expenses for
one year, while the partner orga—
nization provides meaningful,
hands-on involvement for the fel-
lows in that organizations work.

Proposals which receive funding
would begin no earlier than Ju'ne
2001, utilizing fellows selected
from the class of ZOOlr

“If organizations in the com-
munity can creatively think ofa
program that our graduates can
become involved with, we would

, love to hear from you,” Cutchins

said. “Any organization is wel—
come to submit a proposal.”

The Grinnell College gradu»
ate would not displace current
employees, butfwould provide a
tangible service to a partner orga—
nizadon.

should contact Doug Cutchins at
