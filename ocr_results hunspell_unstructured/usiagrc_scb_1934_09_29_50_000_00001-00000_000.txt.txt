Two Dramas
to Open Fall
Play Season

Comedy by Anatole France
Heads Double Program;
Tryouts Next Week

“The Man Who Married a Dumb
Wife,” a twoeact comedy, will be pre»
sented during mideNovember as the
first dramatic production of the year,
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, head of the
drama department announced today.

The play, written by the late Alla»
tole France, one of the greatest of
modern playwrigliis, is a modern in-
terpretation of the old French farce.
Unusually fine and unusually funny,
it includes a number of musical so.
lections and dancing exhibitions
well, according to Mrs. Pryor.

First Given in 1915

The play was first produced in Wal—
lack’s theatre in New York in 1915
and since then has been very popular
with Little Theatre groups and col—
leges. in 1933 it was awarded first
place in the Little Theatre tourna—
ment in New York

The translator, Curtis H. Pages. says
of the play: “In ‘The Man Who Mar.
ried a Dumb Wife’, the social satire on
the profession of law and medicine is
thoroughly up—to—date. Much of it is
done in the broad medieval mahner,
but everything is delicately worked
out in detail. The author has listed the
language of today and yet perfectly
reproduced the tone and spirit of med-
ieval comedy."

Johnson Adapting Designs

Carl Johnson, technical director. is
adapting the original Robert Edmund
Jones stage designs as used in the
Granville Barker production,

“The Man Who Married a Dumb
Wife,” has a cast of 13, Tryouts will
be held the early part of next week

A short melodrama, by Harry Me.
Guire, “Yella,” will be presented as a
curtain raiser. A tale of a stolen gem
and a murder, it is a play which has
won many one act play contests, Mrs.
Pryor asserted.

EAST LANSING, Michvln a
game replete with thrills, Michi-
gan State outscored a fighting
Grinnell eleven here this after-
noon by a 33 to 20 score. The
game was climaxed by a 9 -yard
touchdown run by Anderson, star
Pioneer end, as the pistol sound.-
ed ending the game,

While Michigan State was the
more consistent team in gaining
through the line, fumbles and
passes played a big part in thc
Grinnell defeat.

Anderson, Clark Score

Anderson and Clark stood out
for the visitors, the former ac-
counting for all of the Grinnell
touchdowns.

The first half of the game was close
throughout. The Spartans gained
their 7—point advantage by right of
arr’ incomplete pass over the goal line
which the officials ruled good on the
grounds of interference.
No pains were made in the second
quarter, the only scoreless stanza dur—
ing the game. Early in the period the
Michigan State aggregation threaten—
ed to count but an incomplete toss
over the goal from the seven yard
line gave the ball to the Pioneers.

Spartans Score Twice
Clark fumbled the opening kickoff
at Vibe start of the second half, giv—
ing Michigan State posession of the
ball deep in Grinnell territory. A pass
on the third play following the fum—
ble was good for a score.
Sebo, Spartan substitute hack, open-
ed the final stanza with a jaunt
around Grinnell’s end to the 22 yard
line and followed it up with another
and run for a touchdown.

Grime" Tries Passes
With the score 33 to 14 against them,
the visitors unleashed a desperate pass-
ing attack. On the first play follow-
ing the kickoff, Clark was covered
when attempting to pass but eluded a
number of tackle): and ran for a.
first down.

The Pioneers’ attempt to score
through the air proved unsuccessful,
and with only minutes to play Michi-
gan State regained the ball and started
a fulal touchdown drive.

Touchdown Drive Fails

The tired Grimlell team seemed unr
able to stop the plunging Spartan
backs and another touchdown seemed
certain if sufficient time to score re-
mained.

As the time—keeper raised his gun,
therMichigan team attempted a final
pass, which Anderson snatched on
his own ten yard line, carrying the
