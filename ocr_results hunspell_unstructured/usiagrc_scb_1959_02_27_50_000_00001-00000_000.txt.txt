Students Elecl
Faunce Prexy

by Bill McCluns
(Feature Editor)

Joining a long procession
of Grinnell Student Council
presidents, Steve Faunce this

k handled the gavel in his
' ative functions as head of
the student governing body.
The first council meeting unr
der his leadership was spark-
ed by the presence of the
controversial and presently
vivid issue concerning the
possible opening of dormitor.
ies for dating and social pur—
poses. Consequently, only shy
speculations can be made as
to how he will run future
council activities

Faunce, an economics major
,who operates from behind a
pair oi heavy horn-rimmed
glasses, emerged from last
weekend‘s campaign activity
a 420—334 vote victor over Joe
Nassif. The voters last Mon-
day were forced to select be-
tween two candidates of wide-
ly divergent personalities: a
divergence that one might
imagine could be synthesised
into an absolutely ideal S£u<
dent Council president.

Nassif at one end represents
a dynamic. daring intelligence
and worldliness that one can-
not but think might have
been a bit too daring and per.
haps a bit too worldly at
times, but nevertheless would
be an asset to strong lead—
ersbip.

At the other end we have
Eaunoe symbolizing an equal-
ly luteuigent conservatism
which one cannot but think
might be a bit too passive at
times, but nevertheless is es-
sential to responsible leader-
ship. Grlnneﬂ selected the
latter personality.

The new president is a man
who is sufficiently devoid of
impetuous‘rty so as to be able
to deal with both sides of a
controversial issue with an
objectivity that is not always
revered at the University Age.
One senses that he has a res
pectable control over the mul-
tiple aspect of a given situa—
tion, This mastery can and
will certainly lead him to
specific conclusions on the
various issues that will ,intera
est Grinnellians in the next
two semesters; with exactly
what vehemence and respect»
able fortitude he will assert
diese conclusions, it is left
for Time to observe.

Women Approve Hours, Budget;
Monlh Trial Set On Hours Plan

At a mass meeting of all women Students last Mon—

day,

a proposed experimental

program of extending

women‘s hours until 12:30 on Saturday night and 12:00
every other night was unanimously approved.

Ill addition the women approved the budget for sec»,
and semester; accepted an amendment to the constitution

abolishing mass meetings to
approve the budget; and de—
feated a petition to change
freshman votes in AWS Board
elections from 2/3 to 1/2 value
in proportion to upperclass-
women's votes.

With the help of President
Howard R. Bowen, the AWS
Board has prepared the fol»
lowing statement in regard
to the Quadrangle closing
hours experiment: “The prin—
ciple of the proposed hour-s
program is to allow people to
come and go as they like, but
we need a daily security
check. Women students are on
their honor to comply with
all of the stipulations of the
program. It is our purpose to
create a sense of collective re-
sponsibility among women
students.

“The experiment will run
for one month; then a study
will be made as to the sys-
tems effect on campus life7
studies, social life, sleep,
health, etc. At the end of the
month, the advantages and
disadvantages as determined
by the studies and opinions of
the women will be weighed.
We will then decide whether
or not to continue the pro—
gram as is, make changes, or
discontinue it."

The revised program issued
Monday and going into at
feet that night states that:

i. All women will be ex—
pected to be inside the Quad-
rangle by 12 midnight Sunday
through Friday and by 12:30
on Saturday, with the possible
exception of later hours for
major campus events and
parties on Saturday.

2. No late pers or late min-
utes will be given. It will be
regarded as extremely excep-
tional for someone to come in
late. In case of unavoidable
lateness, the girl will sign a
sheet showing her name, the
time, and the reason for
latentss. Repeated or lengthy
violation wil be handled by
the AWS Board with the pos-
sibility of legislaﬁon later.

3. There will be no men in
the loggia or halls after the
loggia is locked at 10:30 Sun-

day through Thursday, 1 0
Friday, and 12:30 Saturday.

4. Quiet and noisy hours
will remain the same as
they are now.

5. The Union will close at
Women’s hours, The grill will
be open as late as Saga Food
Service wishes. The library
will Close at 11:30 pm. Mon»
day through Friday, 6 pm.
Saturday and 10:30 pm. on
Sunday.

Sludenl Council Commll'lee
Submils Curriculum Findings

“The committee finds in the

general attitude of the proposed

curriculum revision a valuable addition to the program of Grin-
nell college. We find the emphasis, on independent work and'the
attempt to de»emphaslze grades in advanced courses especially

valuable.” _
This is the beginning of the
Student-Faculty Relations com—
mittee’s report to the Curricu-
lum committee of the faculty
concerning the proposed Curr
riculum changes first published
in the Scarlet and Black Jan. 9.
The student-Faculty Rela-
tions committee directed much
of its praisc toward the fresh—
iiian studies program which
would “seek to exhibit man
in his characteristics as a
purposive, moral creature . . .
(and) to relate moral man,
value—holding and goalrseek»
ing, to certain of the social
institutions he has developed
. . The committee said that
the freshman studies would
provide a valuable basis for a
liberal arts program, although
problems would be caused by
the large size of the discussion

groups which would compose
it (20 or 30), and by the fact
that there would he a great
difference in the competence
of the instructors in the var—
ious sections of the program.
Because the freshman plan
would replace freshman Eiiga
lish, the committee said that
writing should and could be
emphasized in ircshman stud—
ies.

The group said that the soph~
oniore studies program would
be valuable, but should not be
required because adding another
requirement would not give the
sophomore enough time to ex-
plore particular fields of inter.
est. The proposed supervised
reading in the junior year was
