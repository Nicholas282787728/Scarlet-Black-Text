Here in Grinnell that is not really
possible. which makes my you that
much harder Usually we have just
enough material to eke out an ap-

like anyone else, I [ind it difficult to

It's strange, but much oi the
talent and originality on this cams
pus goes unrecognized. Talented
individuals do not necessarily con
tribute to the usual channels {or air-
tistic recognition. They often igr
nore the studio art courses, the or-
chestra, and other opportunities
for involvement. Instead, they “do
their own thing." It’s a form of
judgment, oi condemnation. in a
sense their attitude says, We are

joying our talents,

to like my part in the paper to
bring together groups on the cam-

First-rate essays, good illustra-

on these pages. Also, as i have only
limited knowledge oi many of the
worthwhile things that are going

ferent way of Viewmg things. When
I began reading Mr. Berger's arti»
cle. my first reaction was, "This

amused i was. What's wrong with

Always, the best works oi art stand
up to such examination One oi the
worst criticisms a painter can
receive is that he churned out "ins

Madonna —— or Gertrude Stein —
and see a real human. Perhaps
distorted. but perhaps more
revealing as a result.

Mr. Berger’s article taught me
something, and at the same time
amused me with an iconoclastic
and charmingly philistine tone

essays, reminiscence, humor 7

BandeAid House:

by Vincent Presser

Discovering the "right" liie, the
one in accord with "the good," has
been a goal oi students ior
thousands of years. Therefore, it is
bracing to learn that some
humans, or Grinnellians, have
found an outpost oi civilization, oi
grace. oi charm. They call it
“BandAld House." I spent some
time With the natives over winter
break. learning their ways and
customs. i wish to share my iin-
dings with you, Alter all, we should

You can imagine how thrilled l
was- when I learned that i had a
chance to stay in Band~Aid House,
You’ve heard of it, too — and
always in hushed tones of awe. But
what is the mystery that enshrouds
the place? Surely. it we dispel the
myths we can come to a greater
understanding or the house and its
occupants, thereby discovering a
new, diiterent, and exciting part oi
the world in which we live.

Band-Aid House is a privately
owned. purelysiorrprofit rooming

house. It is not owned by the col-
lege. Even the college must draw
the line somewhere. Within the
grand Victorian recesses oi this
manse (located at 1129 Broad
Street) is a waiter oi decayed
plaster, littered with Usherrlike
iissures But. or course, the ex-
terior is the most iamous part oi

gives the house its name, is oi a
