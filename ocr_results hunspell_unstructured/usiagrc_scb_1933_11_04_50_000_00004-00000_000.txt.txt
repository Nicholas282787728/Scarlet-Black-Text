versity football team, and Joe Gib-
bons, St. Mary’s, Kans, reserve quar-
terback, are definitely lost to the
Blucjay squad for the remainder oi
the season because of knee injuries.
it was announced here today. Both
men have turned in their suits.

Hopes had been held throughout
the season that the injuries, both
pie-season scrimmages,

tions yesterday revealed no change
for the better.

Colllll's grcat performanccs lest
year were one reason why Creighton
was ranked this season as an early
favorite for the conference champion»
ship. In addition to being the best

 

passer and broken field runner on‘v
the squad, Collin's punts averaged
slightly over 50 yards during the en-
tire season.

Gibbons will likewise be missed, as
he was the biggest quarterback on
the squad, standing 6 feet 2 inches
tall and weighing 180 pounds.

Lewis are spending the weekend at
their homes in West Liberty.
