Camp association to link with
Dollars and Scholars program

The Grinncll Girls Camp Associa
tion, sponsor of the Grinncll Camp
Fire program and the former Camp
Hawikuh west of Grinncll, is one of
several organizations which has cho—
son to award its annual scholarships
under the umbrella of the Grinncll
Dollars for Scholars program.

Proceeds from the sale ofthe camp
to Tallgrass Prairie Audubon Society
for a nature conservancy in I997 have
been designated to establish two $500
scholarships which will be given
through Dollars for Scholars to two
Grinncll High School graduating 5e»
niors, Two additional $500 scholars
shipswillbegiventostudentsgraduatr
ing fromBrooklyn-Gucmscy-Malcom
(BGM) High School.

Priority consideration will be given
to students who intend to pursue envi-
ronmental studies orwhose careerplan
involves children.

“Thecampwasdevelopedforyoung
people and whenthecamp wassoldwe
wanted to give back to the community
and its young people in a way that
would continue the camp’s original
purpose," says Mary Shutts, president
ofthe camp association. “Giving these
scholarshipsthrough Dollars forScholr
ars is a way to accomplish this."

“There are many beneﬁts both for
students and for an organization to

come under the umbrella ofDollars for
Scholars," Says Dan Keller, vice presi-
dent of the local chapter and also a
guidance counselor at Grinncll High
School “By awarding a scholarship
under Dollars for Scholars, a person or
group may may maintainits owniden-
tity, may name the scholarship, may
set criteria forwho receives the scholars
ship and may present the scholarship
as usual on Awards Night."

Dollars for Scholars eases the bur-
den onasrudentand famiiybyprovid-
ing a common application form, says
Keller, and a trained committee ofvolr
unteers scores and selects the recipient
based on predetennined criteria. Scor-
ing is completed in a manner that is
objective and preserves the anonymity
ofthe applicants, he adds, which takes
pressure offa group giving an award.

Several hundred colleges nationwide
participate in the ”Collegiate Partners
Program" and agree not to reduce a
student's aid for all scholarships res
eelved through Dollars for Scholars,
Kellar adds. Some colleges even par-
ticipate in a matching grant program.

Authorities recover
knife believed
used in murder

Grinnell police have recovered a
weapon believed to have been used in
the slaying ofa Grundy Center man
here Feb. 6, Chief Michael Birming-
ham confrrmed Friday.

The weapon, a simple pocket knife
with a 3—inch blade, was found behind
one ofthe three housed purchased by
the city and located west ofthe Public
Safety Building in the 400 block of
Fourth Ave. Those houses have been
marked for demolition.

The knife is believed to have bee
sued by Archie Robert Bear, 30, of
Tama, who is accused of ﬁrst-degree
murder in the death of Max Lavem
Purk, 23, ofGrundy Center, formerly
ofTama.

Found Thursday afternoon

Police found the weapon at mid-
aﬁemoon Thursday. Authorities had
been looking for the knife for nearly
three weeks.

Authorities are continuing to piece
together evidence and witnesses’ ac-
counts ofthe incident. In an afﬁdavit
ﬁled earlier, Sgt. Randy Hanssen, the
Grinncll Police Department’s chief
investigator, said Bear arrived at the
police station shortly aﬁer the inci-
dent and announced that he had “just

sliced someone‘s throat ” Bear then
left but was later taken into custody.
Authorities are now trying to detcr~
mine whether Bear disposed of the
alleged murder weapon prior to com-
ing to the police station or aﬁer leav-
ing. The property on which the knife
was found is located across Spring St.
from the Public Safety Building.
Bear remains in the Poweshiek
County Jail in Lieu “$250,000 bond,

ney General Jim Kivi are expected to

tion sometime this month. Bear then
