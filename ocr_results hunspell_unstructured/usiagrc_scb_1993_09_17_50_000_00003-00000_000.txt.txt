Problems With the Vending Machines

By Sarah Cornell

IRST of all, we should be

the COInS go in and nothing comes out . ..
Grinnellians often fight back.

Nancy Reno, directorof the Intema-

broken machines lies with the students
themselves, and not the ones who just
can’t get thm grape soda: ‘ihey rock the
machines and try to get free cans." Free

If a machine does break down. it
should be repent-d immediately, or it will

Uptown Business Boosted By Students' Return

By Matt Harbur

 

OR litany of us, by Junior
l-ltgh it had already been

socially detertnilted who
were the “artists“ and who were
bound for other things, The girl who
could most realistically render a horse
was given complete admiration from
her fifth gradeclass, while the ten year
old ballerina who struggled with her
steps, was told she wasn't graceful
enough. As a result of this seetaliza-
Lion, ntany children grow up well
versed in phrases suchas,“0h, i can’t
draw" or “I can’t keep a beat". Many
of us have these ideas ingrained so
deeply withm ourselves that being
asked to sing with a group or draw a
simple picture makes us nervous.

Due to this socialization, we of-
ten enduploosingtouch with ourtnner
artist, which lives deep within us. Our
sense of spontaneity and admiration
for the details becomes lost in a mishr
mashof daily chores and future plans.

However, the inner artist is still
alive and well within all of us. Each
day wcweavcbcaudtttl pathswith the
steps we take,dtawing eutthe lines of
our lives with anistic perfection. Like
the musician creatively ehoostng her
notes, we all make imponantehoices.
Like the poctpicking beautiful words
to ﬁthispoem, we all look for beauty.
And like a painter braving a clean
white canvas, we all take exciting
risks. These chances we take. are the
marks and colors we choose to paint,
painting our lives into a unique and
beautiful piece ofztrt work.

The lesson tobelcamed from the
painter. the poet. and the musician is
that life ‘5 to create and explore. The
excitement comes from continually
taking risks and beingable to proudly
admire the outcome.

We are all artisLs. We all create
beauty and magic. The key is to nur-
turethatloveforbeauiyandadvcntute
and to break away from the critics we
ﬁnd around us as well as within us.
Creating is Simple. The only hard part
is realizing that you cando no wrong,
