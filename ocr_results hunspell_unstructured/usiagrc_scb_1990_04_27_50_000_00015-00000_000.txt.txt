Baseball Team Demolished by
Rams. Fall to O-lO Overall

by Jessica Weisel

Cornell came to play baseball
on Wednesday, but IL was not the
Rams who got slaughtered. In only
five innings, Cornell defeated the
Grinnell baseball team in a land-
slide, 16-1.

Because Grinnell was losing by
more than 10 runs after the fifth
inning, the umpires stopped the
game.

The tone of the game was set
early as Cornell jumped out to an
eight-run lead in the first inning off
pitcher Rodd Casper. They then
added two more runs in the second.
The Pioneers managed to send one
runner across home, but stranded
two in the bottom of the second.

Cornell scored four runs in the
third inning. Caspergave up a lead
off, solo home run, and the other
three scored on a basesrclenring
triple offrelieverBen Wallace. The
scoring was completed in the top of
the founh inning when the Rams
added two more mtheir total. After
Grinnell was unable to shonen the
gap in the next two innings, play
was Stopped.

The game was not without its
momenm. Dave Shane, playing
first base, made a dazzling grab to
prevent an extra-basehit in the top
of thesecond and Wallace was able

to put the Rams down in order in
the fifth.

Grinnell is now 0-10 in confer-
ence play. They travel to 111mm;
College for a tournament this
weekend.

Ultimate Splits at Intercollegiates

by Andrew Rutledge

in it’s sfirst cvcr intercollegiate
tournament, the men's ultimate-
frisbec team won one out of two
games. The split entitles the triumr
phant GrinnEllephanls to advance
on to the regional tournament this
Saturday at Carleton.

During the inaugural game, the
GrinnEllephants took on a strong
Kansas University team that had

St. Louis U. After frightening the
K.U. team bycomingontothe field
linedup in “Elephantrtrunkbunny-
hop formation," chanting, “Grin-
nEllephants on Parade,” the in-
trepid men of Grinnell scored two

nEllephrrnls close early, but the
moreexpericnced play ofK.U. was
too much as Grinnell eventually
lost 156.

In the second game, under the

GrinnEllcphants found themselves

off a trick “turtle" play, Grinncll
rallied for four straight goals bee

This victory qualified Grinnell
for the regional tournament at Car-

versity of Illinois and Winona in
opening round games. Rallying
behind the cry of, “So...was that a
foul?" the Grinncll ultimate team
looks to be a dark horse contender
at regionals.

athletes. Too many college athletes
have graduated from universities
without having fulﬁlled the proper
requirements, A perfectexample of
a “gift" degree is Patrick Ewing of
the New York Knicks. He has a
leamrng disability, but he holds a
full degree from Georgetown Uni-
versity in Washington, D.C. The
fact is, he should not have received a
full degree from that college.

Many athletes have gotten
through college on their athletic
ability, and that is simply not right.
The students in any given college
should be there because of their
academic aptitude, not their athletic
ability. Division 1 and 11 schools
have lowered their academic stan-
dards to the point at which they are
hardly existent. These two proposlr
lions, if utilized correctly, will force
athletes to be students also.
