Grinnell NOW chapter drafts pro-Dentel letter

Iiy Trciih (‘lclniiil

A growmg concern among Ate
iirmative Action supporters with
thc inequity oi salaries between
male and female administrators
has prompted a statement by the
Grinncll Chapter of the National
(irudilization of Women calling for
a “genuine policy of Affirmative
Action" with a focus on the par-
licular case of college Activities
Counselor Georgia Dcntcl,

The statement came in the form
oi a letter sent by Jeanne Burkle,
chairperson of the Affirmative
Action Task Force of the Grinnell
Chapter of NOW, to the three other
Affirmative Action committees at
the college: the Affirmative Action
Advisory Council (a faculty-
student committee chaired by
education department head
Roberta Atwell) and the Af-
firmative Action committees

established under the auspices of
the Student Government
Association and Concerned Black
Students The letter was sent in an
attempt to enlist the support at the
three committees in actively en»
couraging "the hiring of women,
blacks. and non-whites” and “the
retention of women who have
served this college well for many
years "

UENTEL had been the developer
and director of the college's social
and cultural activities program [or
16 years when she was fired in
August, 1975, along With Gone
Director Kathy McCluskey and
Dean ot the Curriculum Mary
Eysenhach. Their duties were
taken on by Recreational Facilities
Director Thomas Latimer and
Dean Waldo Walker. Dental and
McCluskey were later rehired by
the administration on a part-time

basis with lowered salaries

NOW has recently concentrated
on Dentel's case, viewing it a
crucial one through which to [ﬁt
the committment of the ad,
ministration to a concrete, ongoing
Affirmative Action policy. The
letter asks'that the committees
“. . , intervene on behalf of Georgia
Dcntcl and demand that the ad
ministration of Grinnell College
assure her that her services to this
college are ot great value and that
those services shall be rcwarded
accordingly. that is, that she shall
receive much more substantial
compensation for the job that she
does,” In addition, the letter
claims that “the job offered to MS
Dentel relegates her to a subor»
dinate position and carries no
promise that her affiliation with
the college will continue," and that
“this administration has

“You have to do practical
things give people skills, never
mind their having the right
proletarian attitude. Ten Hsiao
Ping is along that line, a Very
practical iellow."

llE DESCRIBES the Gang of
Four that the new regime replaced
as a “fanatical and vindictive
group" who fell from power
because or its attempts to crush
opposition by accusing rivals oi
harboring bourgeoisie tendencies
“while lacking the objectivity and
breadth of Mac to use that kind of
thing ior larger aims."

Fairbank has hopes for the
success of the new regime. He
considers Teng Hsiao Ping a very

capable leader. “He's the party'

boss who knows where all the
bodies are buried, where all his
iriends are. He knows the personel
like nobody else The chief hope is
that he can get the machine to
function better, It’s an enormous
bureaucratic mechanism, and the
minute morale slips and people
lose their enthusiasm the whole
thing may fall apart." He cons
siders Hua’s government to be
fairly Stable, and feels that despite
the ditiicult and challenging
problems it faces it has made some
progress and is likely to succeed.

iT IS also clear that chances are
considerably improved for nor-
malization of relations between
China and the US. due to the
pragmatic character of Hua’s
regime. Fairbank described some
of the variables thatwill affect the
process as the American public’s
perception of the new regime, the
economic conditions in China, and
‘Pcking's relation with the Soviet
Union. The latter seems unlikely to
improve, however. Despite the iact
that the relatively moderate new
regime is ideologically closer to
the Soviet model, Fairbank con-
siders a closer relation im-
probable “There is still the
question of the antagonism of two
national interests, two cultures,
two different ieaderships. This
kind of hostility, once it gets

come. The other side is the enemy,
They are each dead set to be the
leader of the Communist world."

Nevertheless, the achievement
of normalization in USsChina
relations faces very serious
stumbling blocks. In the
diplomatic area arises the
seemingly insoluble problem of the
disposition of Taiwan. The “two
China policy” is totally unac-
ceptable to Peking. yet the U.S.
cannot abandon Taiwan in View of
our treaty obligations and ’ex-
tensive cultural and commercial
ties

AS FATRBANK puts it, “Taiwan
is a separate regime with 17
mi ion people They don't want to
join the mainland, and they won't.
For us to pressure them on that
issue becomes a moral question.
Taiwan is a part oi the Western
world much more than the
mainland, you can't just throw that
to the wolves." As well as posing a
difficult moral question, the
disposition of Taiwan is “an ins
soluble problem in terms oi logical
law. liyou try to settle it in legal or
logical terms, you'll wind up in
irustration and probably collapse

 

intellectually.” Yet despite the
seemingly insurmountable legal
and moral problems involved,
”Peking is simply too big to
disregard, We ought to do business

with them on an equal basis l' _
Aside irom the diplomatic

problem, dilemmas also exist in
the realm of cultural and com»
mercial contact. Different
economic systems will create
problems in trade and business
relations, Futhermore, the
Western Concept of normalized
relations between countries
provides for open borders. But the
cultural and ideological gap bet
ween China and the West will limit
the extent of these open borders
no matter‘what kind of Settlement
is achieved.

"CHINA IS n closed society, a
controlled society,” states Fair-
bank, “Foreigners that come in
are uncontrolled Chinese don't
want open contact and won’t for
some time. It would be subversive
to them. There would be nothing
worse than having Americans
running around asking questions.
They would provide an example of
another system that seems to be
more affluent.”

”Unless the administration‘

the Aiiirmative Action Advisory
Council will not take any action on
Ms. Dentel's behalf," Burkle said
'1‘] I ADVISORY Council is not
connected with the administration
and has no policyrmakmg power,
but could conceivably wield the
greatest influence or all the
committees concerned with the
Dentel situation, according to
Atwell. Atwcll anticipates that the

committee will ”hound” the ad
ministration to “try to achieve
some equity as far as salaries go."

”l Suspect that the Committee
will approve it irom the point oi
view that we are concerned about
salaries in general, All we can do is

ministration) , . Beyond that, we
really have no power," she said.

ATWELL added that “ , , , it

dollars just to be a woman,"

Dean Walker said he had
received no correspondence on the
Dcntel situation and refused to
speculate on what actions
