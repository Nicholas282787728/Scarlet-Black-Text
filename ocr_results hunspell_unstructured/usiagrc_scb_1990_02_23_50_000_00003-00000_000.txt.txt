Poet Elaborates on Role of Black
Soldiers During Vietnam. War

by Jessica Weisel

'lhe role of African-American
soldiers during the Vietnam War is
often omitted from discussions of
the war. Few people are aware of

African-Americans just emerging
from the early phases of the Civil
Rights Movement. Popularhistories

tensions mat surrounded the war,
both in Vietnam and at home.

Through poetry, Cranston
Knight attempts to raise awareness
about black Vietnam soldiers.
“Most black Americans, at the
bottom line, saw themselves as
Americans. And that’s where there
is such contradiction,“ Knightsaid.
“Black American soldiers faced an
entirely different situation than did
white soldiers.” He pointed out the
contradictory issues
that blacks had to face
when they became
involved in the war.
“Johnson sent soldiers
to Vietnam in ‘65. He
did not pass the Voter
Registration Act until
these soldiers had
already been in
Vietnam a couple of
months. That meant

soldier from the South.

Communists to free the
Asians for democracy.
You had never even
lived under that
yourself,"

“At that time, basir
cally, blacks were
trying to get into the
society,” said Knight.

“There should have been more

movement,becauseadisproponion-
are number of blacks were front-
line troops.”

According to Knight, while
African-Americans made up only
13 percent of the total army, they
were 30 percent of the fronbline
troops. Outof90,0003hocktroops,
30,000 were black and, Knight
estimates. another 5000 were
Hispanic. Only two percent of
ofﬁcers were black. For soldiers
ﬁghting “another people of color,"
Knight said, tensions increased as
the war became viewed as an
imperialist war.

This tension increased after the
1960‘s ghetto riots. For black sol»
diets retuming home, there was no
transition period. Furthermore,

Habitat for Humanity
Combats Housing Problem
in Poweshiek County

By Ann Trcisttnan

“When you walk along the
streets of Grinnell you may not see
homeless people lying in gutters,
butmerearepeoplewithouthomes,"
AnnaLitton asserted. Liuon pointed
out that many homes are over»
crowded, conditions in Grinnell’s
two trailer parks are poor, and that
the town‘s four govemmentvsubsi-
dized housing developments do not
relieve the problem.

She is a member of the
newly organized Habitat for Hu-
manity of Poweshiek County.
According to Kevin Herrick. presi-
dent of Poweshiek County‘s chap-
Icr, this national orynization iscon-
cemed with the lack of low-cost
homes found in the United States
today.

”The ‘Amen'ean Dream’
is to own a house, adog, a car," said
Herrick in a cynical tone. He ac-
knowledged,“Thc need fora house
is reality if you’re going to have
ﬁnancial stability.” Habitat buys
rundown houses verycheaply, with
money raised in the community.
Volunteers renovate the homes and
families who cannot afford market
prices can receive a no—interestloan
from the group, thereby enabling
them to afford monthly payments.

“We don‘t have a lot of
money, but we do have a great re
source in labor,” explained Her-
rick. “We use that resource to keep
the costs down." The families are
expected to participate in “sweat
equity,” working from 200 to 500
hours on various Habitat houses.

Currently, the Powshiek
chapter is made up of members of
thecollegecommunityandthetown
of Grinneli. Herrick was delighted
by the enthusiastic response from
the townspeople, and emphasized

the imponance of lawyers, social
workers, and realtors in the organi
zation. ‘Thecollegestudents won’t
always be around." he said. citing
summer and winter breaks as times
when, “the community will have to
pick up where we leave of 3’

Herrick is very conﬁdent
about committment from the town.
He mentioned that they plan to hold
icecream socials during the sum-
mer to help raise money. Healso is
looking to the local churches for
fundraising.

In addition to raising capi-
tal, Habitat of Poweshiek County
must ﬁnd a house. “I hope that the
ﬁrst one is in Grinnell," conﬁded
Herrick. He felt that a house in
close vicinity of the college would
draw more volunteers.

Once a family moves in,
and begins paying the low rent of
about $120 a month. the house is
considered theirs. Habitat for

Humanity only requires that the in-
habilants are a family with chil-
dren, and that they are in need.
Other criteria is up to the individual
chapters.

Art 'I'hayer, head of the
Mid-Iowa Community Action
Center in Grinnell,which runs such
projectsas the Second Mile, ischair
ofthe familycommittee. Litton isa
member of this group determining
Poweshiek County’s methods for
deciding whowillgetlhefitsthome.

Both Litton and Herrick
hope that work can begin early next
year. The chapter applied for a
$15,000 grant from the United
Thank Offering. a funding organi-
zation afﬁliated with the Episcopa»
lian Church. If they receive it,
Herrick says that the goal of begin-
ning work by next fall is, ”quite
possible, considering the speed at
which we can raise money."
