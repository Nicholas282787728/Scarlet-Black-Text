”Buy A BrickII
Drive Monday

Campaign To Provide
Funds For Proposed
Gymnasium Projeci

A “Buy a Brick” campaign
will be launched Monday
night to indicate to alumni"
and friends of Grinnell college
that the student body and faculty
of the school are 100 percent
behind the new gymnasium pro-
ject, according to Robert Young,
president of the Student council.

A tag sale will be started Mon-
day at 10 p. m. in all halls and
cottages, and the campaign will
be concluded within twenty.four
hours, Young said.

A huge chart will be placed
in the first floor corridor of the
Alumni Recitation hall. on which
each student or faculty member
who purchases a brick may place
a paper brick on the “Wall of
Loyalty," it was stated.
According to present plans,

every person who buys a brick
will have his name recorded on
a permanent bronze plaque in the
“Hall of Memories" which is a
proposed part of the new gym-
nasium.

The tags will sell for ten cents.
but the purpose of the campaign
is more to prove that the stu-
dents and faculty of the college
are boosting the new gymnasium
than to raise money, Young stut-
ed, as he emphasized the fact
that 100 per cent cooperation
innn every person is needed if the
purpose of the campaign is to he

National Student Poll Shows Collegians Favor Willkie

Survey Lists Third
‘Term Cains During
Nine Months Period

Austin, TexdsiAmel'ican college
opinion is almost equally divided
between Franklin Roosevelt and
Wendell Willkie.

Results tabulated this week for
the first student Opinion Surveys
of America poll of the college
year show the Republican candi-
date with a minute lead of one-
half of one per cent, Willkie's
majority is so slim that, consider-
ing the allowable margin of error
(a or 4 per cent) in all scientific
sampling, it would be more ap-
propriate to say that college stua
dents are about evenly divided on
the two candidates.

Scores of personal interviewers
using uniform methods over this
cross section of campuses asked
students, "Whom do you want no
see elected president in Novem-
her?"

All students,
WILLKIE, said 505 per cont
ROOSEVELT, said....49.5 per cent

(Of all the students inbor-
viewed, 6 per cent declared they
had not decided.)

Not all college students are
eligible to vote, of course, but of
the thousands who are 21 or
older and will go to the polls on
Tuesday, a majority will probably
give their support to Willkie.
cross tabulations of qualified vot—
ers gave those percentages, ad-
justed to eliminate undecided an-
swers:

Voting students:
WILLKIE .52.; per cent
ROOSEVELT, 475 per cent

This poll was aken before the
President swung fully into his
speaking tour, and it may be that
before election day he may in—
fluence many coilegians, with the
possibility of his taking the

Kuhl Replaced
By Buckley

Pres, Sievens Explains
Disciplinary Measures
AI’ Special Chapel

William D. Buckley, junior stu-
dent from Maplewood, N. J., was
elected to succeed Thorn Kuhl as
managing editor of the Grinnell
Scarlet and Black yesterday at a
meeting of the Publications board.

Buckley, who has been a staff
member of the newspaper for two
years, was named following ad-
ministrative disciplinary measures
taken this week which resulted in
Kuhl’s dismissal from school for
the remainder of the semester.
He assumes office with this is-
sue.

Stevens Addresses Chapel.

President Samuel N. Stevens,
speaking to the student body at a
special chapel program Thursday,
said that the disciplinary actions
of the week were taken as a
result of an apparent lack of self-
discipline on the part of a num<
ber of students during the home-
coming weekend.

”We have had too much individ-
ualism with too little social re-
sponsibility," be said "You, as a
student body, are aware of the
fact that there are many who
are completely indifferent to their
responsibilities. We ,want a free
system in which each individual
finds a favorable ground in which
to grow, in which to gain wis-
dom and in which to acquire
social consciousness to the re-
