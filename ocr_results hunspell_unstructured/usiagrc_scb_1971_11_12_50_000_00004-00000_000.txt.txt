Music, Russmn Round Out lives

by Don bagenais
over the iireplace hangs a large red
banner, irom which the bearded

Lenin peers down at several stuc
dents sitting around the living room
reading, talking and looking at
newspapers,

Mike Drayton, one oi the iounders
of the House, lights his pipe and
talks through a cloud oi smoke.
“We talk Russian more than most
Russian students...it's getting to
be a lot or fun."

Russian House is one oi only two
Grinnell project houses this year,
and the only language house leit
of a tradition which once included
German, Spanish, and French, The
other project is Music House, ac»
ross the street from James Hall,

“Everyone in the house knows now
that they can speak a lot better than
before.” The residents proclaim
that conversational Russian is spo-
ken a large percentage oi the time,
but rumor has it that the percentage
skyrockeis when visitors, like an
sea reporter, ior instance, are
present.

First Year

"Meg Jess and I conceived the idea
for a Russian House last year,” Mike
says. “We had a hard time getting
people to live here, at first, butnow
a lot at people want to get in.“ Meg
is now on an overseas program, in
Leningrad.

Fifteen students in all live in Rus»
sian House, only three or whom are
Russian majors. But all are taking
courses in Russian, and quite a iew
hon-resident Russian students drop
in frequently to study and talk.

The rooms are liberally decorated
with coloriul posters, all of which
are in Russian so visitors can't read
them Most feature Lenin and other
revolutionary heroes; Kruschev is
noticeably absent except for one
small picture in the living room.
There is a Russian ilag propped up
in one corner, several Russian
newspapers and magazines lying

Russian House, the language and cultural shrine

around on the Chairs and floor.
Not Much Culture

Russian House subscribes to Iz-
vesiia (which means “news” in
Russian), and Drayton claims that
”it gets read quite a bit.” The
library takes the other Russian
newspaper, Pravda (which means
“truth" Russians say that ”There
is no news in ‘trutb’, and no truthin
‘news.’ "

There is not a great deal at Rus-
sian culture learned in the House,
although resident Brenda Stokesc
berry says that “we listen to a lot
of Russian music and we drink
Russian tea. "

The Grinnell Russian Experience,
Dayton believes, began to happen in
the fall of 1959 when the two pre-
sent Russian proiessors, Mr. Magee
and Mr. whelan, came to campus.
”In political importance Russian as
a language has done downhill in re
cent years,” Drayton says, ”but
Magee and whelan have succeeded
here in generating excitement."The
two prois “drop over quite a bit, he
noted, particularly during the par
ties.

As for next year, the continued ex-
istence of Russian House hinges on
how many people want to live in one.
As one resident said, “It Just de—
pends on their enthusiasm."

American Music

Music House, at 1130 Exist Street,
is also a first of its kind this year.
Bill Thomas, House coordinator,
says that "the purpose is just toget
together a group oi people who are
interested in American music ”

Ron Stanford tried to start a Music
House two years ago, Thomas says,
but the project was “squelched by
(the Dean of Students) Mrs, Low.”
Last year Bill and Mike O’Connor
got togethertoiorm itand were more
successful. O’Connordoes not live in
the house now, because he has an
apartment in town,

in the House are taking a group study

sored by Mr. Jensen of the Music
department, ”The Music Depart
ment is iinally awakening to Amer-
ican Music,“ Thomas said “This
is the iirst course oiiering in Amer
ican Music there has ever been.”
Last year Mr. Abel sponsored a
group independent in the sameiield,
and Thomas believes that the succ
cess of that project has a greatdeai
to do with the existence ofthe House
this year.

Couldn't Get it Through the Door
Most of the House music activities
are of an informal sort; “the main
requirement is just an interest in
music, so we have jam sessions now
and then.” Everyone in the house
either plays an instrument or sings.
The original plan was to have every
one in the house takethe group stud
is: project either first or second
semester, but “people had con-
flicts,” as resident John Scheckter
put it.

“We were going to havea piano, but
BKLG couldn’t get it through the
door.” Earlier in the semesterpeoc
ple outside the house were coming
over quite a bit iorthejam sessions,
“but not it is slacking off because
people Just don’t have the time.”

Personal Problems

The House’s problems center
around a lack oigroup cohesiveness.
Four or the original iourteen resi-
dents have dropped out or school so
far, Thomas admits, “but it is large-
ly because of a general dissatisfac—
tion with Grinnell; I think the House
might be the reason they came back
this year at all.”

But more than that, “Ifind itreally
hard to study this year, Mostpeople
here are having a lot or run," one
resident complained, Mike Rosen-
Ield ieels that people are justhaving
personal problems: “it’s just not
together enough to make much group
music.”

"I don't think the house is bad, it’s
just not as good as I'd like itto be,”
Thomas concluded. “Next semester
things could be a lot diiieren .”

ily the Anericam ilag at hali mast and the on
flag at full mast has been in effect at Ward
iield tor several years.

But no one really

wants a third ilag on central campus, to ily
level with the UN ilag,

The Half Must Debate

Controversy concerning the ilying

of the American flag on the Grinc
nell campus began in the spring of
1969 when Ted Click, now one of
the “Harrisburg Eight” charged
with the attempted kidnapping oi
presidential aid Henry Kissinger,
inverted the flag. The flags posi-
tion immediately became the center
of Controversy. The week beforetlie
debate began, Gov. Ray had sug
gested that state institutions ily the
ﬂag at hali mast each day an lowan
was killed in the war. However, due
to the difficulty in determining the
exact day when an lowan was killed,
and since the war affected Ameri-
cans equally, president Leggett,
with the strong support oi the stu—
dent body, decided to ily the ﬂag at
half mast until the war was ended.

The ilag controversy again started
when the college trustees made
Grinnell 3 World College. As a
World College, Grinnell must ily
the UN ilag. To this end, two new
flagpoles were constructed across
from Herrick. However, the prob-
lem begins when one reads Section
3 of the US. Flag Code. it states:
“No flag shall be flown above the
flag oi the United states, or, ii on
the same level, to the right of the
ilag,

However, the UN Flag Code states
that the UN ilag may not be ilown
lower than any other flag. General
provision (c) and (d) states: When
the flag of the UN is displayed with
one or more ilags, all nags so disV
played should be of approximately
equal size. Provision (d) states:
Oh no account may any ﬂag dis
played with the UN ilag bedisplayed
at a higher level than the UN ilag,

and on no account may any flag dis-
played with the UN ilag be larger
than the UN ilag.

Thus, the US flag code rulesoutthe
possibility oi ilying the US ilag at
half mast since no ilag maybeﬂown
higher than the US flag, and the UN
flag code rules out the possibility
oi flying the UN ilag at half mast.

Another alternative was to place
black crepe on the ilag pole. The
proposition was explained to Mr.
Rick Biermah, the college lawyer.
He objected to the move becausethe
college might be iound guilty oi flag
desecrating ii it carried out this
move,

At this point, Mitch Erickson, re-
presenting Grinnell StudentGovern—
ment Association, sent letters to
both Governor Ray and Senator
Hughes, asking their opinions onthe
matter or black crepe. No answer has
yet been received from either one at
them, But it was hoped thatanaffir»
mative reply from either one would
be an indicationthatthe school would
not be prosecuted for ilying the ﬂag
at hali mast.
