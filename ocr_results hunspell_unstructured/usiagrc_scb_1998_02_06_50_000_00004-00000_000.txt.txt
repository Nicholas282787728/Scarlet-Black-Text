MF: I understand that
you recently assumed this
position of World/ Jazz/
Blues fon'natdirector, What
do you actually do?

GS: I call up record la—
bels and try to get them to
send us CDs. Like, last see
mester. I didn't see a single
CD from Blue Note, which
is the premier jazz label, so
I’m going to call them, give
‘em the business, see if I
can't turn that trend around.
Basically myjob description
is to bullshit record labels
and get them to send us stuff,
even though there really
aren't that many jazz, world,
or blues shows.

MF: So what kind ofstuff
do you actually get?

GS: Well. I kind of call
myself the World Music/ -

didn't seem too worried
about their images. So for a
while Ijiist listened to jazz.
I thought all the stuffI lis-
tened to before wasjust dis-
contented white suburbaintcs
with nothing better to do than
bitch about their boring lives.
I got over that after a while,
thou:t menn,Ilikethemu-
stc and it’s my roots anyway.
so now I like all kinds ofstuff
again, but I listen to more
yazz than anything else.

MF How do you plan to
exploit the fact the you got a
coveted [werhour time slot
this semester?

GS: Oh. I can't wait. In
an hour time slot, you can't
play the longer songs that re»
ally showcase all the impro-
visation and spontaneity that
goes on, Plus. I love having

 

 

Jazz/Blues and Crap format
director becuase I end up getting the
CDS that no one knows what to do
with. It’s fun, though. Iget paid to
listen to some crazy stuff. I got this
CD oftraditional Finnish folk music
that‘s just great. It‘s all polkas and
Finnish people having a great time,
so I‘m slipping it into the new CD
rack in the hopes that it gets some
play.

MF: Last semester you had a jazz
show. Are you planning on mixing
it up a little bit this semester?

GS: Well. the basis of my show
is still deﬁnitely jazz. Itry to play
something from all the subrgcnres of
jazz. You know, acid, hard bop. be-
bop, post-bop, fusion, stufflike that.
Last semester I had to break the for-
mat because of the fire in my room.
Iwas playipg Celtic music,just whatr
ever Icouldlfind. It was like, hey, I

on Sundays this semester...

MF' ...Traditionally thought of as
KDIC's jazz day.

GS: Yeah, so I’ve heard, but I
don't really understand where the
association comes from. I suppose
it‘s because most people think ofjazz
as being kind of mellow, so it goes
with Sunday as being kind of like
recovciy time But

MF: with the sweats and the
chills going on in the studio

GS Yeah, it’s not at all mellow
for me.

Hamlet E E, E i 9/16

Written and adapted by Kenneth
Branagh, Starring Branagh, Kate
Winslet, Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi.

This revrew might look somewhat
familiar to you. The reason is that
through a bizarre mix-up involving
the distributor, several former presir
dents, and Earl Grey tea, Hamlet was
not sent last weekend, but in fact will
be shown THIS weekend. Saves me
a review, too, so I'm in favor. Let's
hope things work out this lime.

Ifyou have an extra 4 hours 2 min-
utes, see this movie. You all know
the story of Hamlet. Hamlet‘s uncle
kills his father, and Hamlet spends
the rest of the play figuring out what
to do about the situation. Finally, he
ends up leaving Denmark and goes
to McDonald’s for a couple of
shakes.

The setting is updated a bit to the
19th century. This decision probably
angers all you Shakespeare purists
out there, but it gives the movie an
excuse for extreme lavishness, and
it delivers.

This movie is easily the most
spectacular combination of cinema
tography with set and costume de
sign ever. This movie positively
leaps from the screen and grabs you
by the lapel: with incredible color
and Vibrancy. The first scene inside
the castle should induce at least 4 or
gasms.,lf not, demand your money
back.

Besides this
fact, the acting
is all around rer

Adam’s

Ribziééé

Directed by
George Kukor.
S t a r r i n g
K a t h e r i n e
Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy.

 

Adam’s Rib is this charming
movie from it time when rnOVies
were black, white, and boring. It cen
ters around the relationship of a lawr
yer couple played by Tracy and
Hepburn who end up on opposite
sides ofa case. The court scenes are
rather ridiculous, but the couple are
played so, so lovmgly by two great
actors that nothing else matters.
Tracy is kind of stoic and laid-back.
but as the conﬂict of the courtroom
escalates, he gradually becomes an-
gry and bitter.

Hepburn is hilarious. Her chaise
ter is a fast-talkin’ feminist, kind of
rare in the cinema for the 405, a de-
cade full ofevil and misery. She is
such an absolute delight to watch.
And the way she and Tracyjustcraft
the marriage is just amazing, and
truly heartwarming.

This movie also tackles issues of
feminism, but it ends up being sort
of unexpected, One might think that,
being the extremely unenlightened
period of the first half of the 20th
century, in the United States. that the
lead actress would throw away her
feminist philosophy in favor of her
man, Not necessarily. Another ap-
proach could be a very patronizing
air, not taking the movement seri-
ously. Again, the movie surprises us
with a balanced portrait that only
gets a little condescending for a
couple of minutes in the courtroom.
It was impressive.

The transitions were amusing,
reminiscent ofsilent films. And Ijust
can't emphaSize enough the brilliant
portrayal by the lead actors of this
married couple. It was so good.

La Femme Nikita é ﬁg

Directed by Luc Besson. Starring
Anne Parillaud and some other
French people.

La Femme Nikita is a French ﬁlm,
and I hope to God they got the sub

titled version. Dubbing is the Worst
invention Since the electric broccoli
saw. Anyway, this movie is all
French. and kind of cool, It stars
Parillaud as a rough, kind of rag-
dolly criminal who is caught while
blowing heads off of cops. She is
sentenced to life in prison, but those
wacky French authorities decide to
put her to death anyway, and label it
a suicide. Strikes me as being
vaguely unconstitutional.

But they give her a choice, see.
They say she can live, so long as she
becomes a deadly assassin and kills
old white men as they eat dinner , it
pretty obvious decision, but after a
while she longs for a real life. She
gets engaged, but possible marriage
to Carlos the Jackal is a daunting
thought. Her love-toy eventually gets
curious. and the rest of the movie
alternates between gunplay and won-
dering if the innocent guy will get
whacked. You won't find the answer
here. '

This movie gets major points for
style. The action is a blend of rough
ness and smoothness, The characters
are kind of clumsy and unprofesv
Storm] in the beginning, but acquire
mad killing skills. This movie rer
minds you ofthe fun ofsnuffing out
the lives of people who can‘t even
see you from your secret hiding
place.

Eve’s Bayou

Written and directed by Kasi
Lemmons. Starring Samuel L. Jack-
son and Lynn Whitfield.

Eve's Bayou is the story of the
prosperous Batiste family who live
in the Louisiana bayou. Told from the
point of view of Eve, the 10 year old
daughter, this movie explores the
various workings of a family with
various problems related to living in
the backwater. Named by Roger
Ebert as the number 1 movie of l997.

Learning the Peterson
“Experience”

BY ANNIKA ENGINEER
Staff Writer

Coming in the back entrance of
the Terrace Gallery at the Forum, one
sees what appears to be a naked
woman hunched over with her spi-
rial cord protruding through her
back. At least this is what Mattie
Johnson ‘01 saw when she decided
to take a look at Rolf Peterson’s art
exhibition.

‘Rolﬁe,’ as he is affectionately re
ferred to by his friends, is an art and
math major in his junior year at
Grinnell College, The showing at the
Forum is the first time that Rolf
Peterson has had all his work dis-
played at the same time. He said that
it is a great feeling to see his artistic
repertoire hung up together, “kind of
like a series."

The exhibition itself is callcd
“Learning Through Experience"
and is so titled because Peterson has
just taken over the responsibility of
running the Forum Terrace Gallery
and says that he has to first have a
show before he can tell others how
to organize theirs. The exhibition
consists of a variety of prints. the
majority of which are in black and
white, a few drawings and two in-
credibly provocative sculptures.
Peterson’s response to Johnson's
aforementioned interpretation was

one of amusement, but he remains
impressed by the variety of senti-
ments that his art work seems to have
provoked. He admits that it is not, in
fact, a naked person hunched over
being impaled by his/her own spinal
cord but claimed that there were per
sonal moLivauons behind the creation
of that sculpture, which, being per-
sonal. he will not share. The second
sculpture, at first glance, appears to
be a uniquely chiseled chunk of
wood. strategically placed on the
floor. However, upon closer inspece
tion, it seems to resemble a turtle.
Greg Peterson ’98, claimed that this
sculpture is his personal favorite,
“because I’ve always been a fan of
crazy coffee tables.” Art is, after all,
subjective,

Peterson's prints are not modeled
after still lives but are a kaleidoscope
of different shapes and structures.
The prints, says Peterson, are not rec-
ognizable as any object or creature
but are visible expressions of dif-
ferent feelings and experiences that
he has gone through. There are also
a few still lifes in this collection of
art work. They are images ofskylines
and Cityscapes silhouetted against
what seems to be either the night sky
or the early dawn without any color.

Peterson's work makes eVidcnt his
abundant talent and displays a wide
range of emotion, evoking a variety
of feelings in the observer.
