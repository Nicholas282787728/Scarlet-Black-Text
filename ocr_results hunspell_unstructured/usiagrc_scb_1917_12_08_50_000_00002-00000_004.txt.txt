G Men

Star and

That Grinuell has sent her quota
of athletes to the front is evidenced
by the fact that out of the 200 Grins
nell men who have enlisted, 31 are
men whom, during their college ca—
recrs, won their Honor G. A large
portion of the remainder are men
who took active interest in athletics
during their college days,

Several of these men, who ‘are ens
listed with the University of Minne-
sota base hospital corps, which has
not been called out as yet, are back
in school this year, but are ready at
any moment to answer the call to
arms.

)Ililly Are Ofﬁcers

Another interesting fact in regard
to the Grinuell athletes who are now
soldiers is the high percentage of
commissioned officers in this group,
one in every three of the 31 men
having received a commission.

serving ar .

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AN

Freshman Football Squad*1917

In looking back over the football
season just past, one which has been
the most successful in the history of
Grinnell, the ordinary [an overlooks
one of the most important factors in
the Success of this year's stale chain—
Dionshlp aggregation This factor,
which has been of invaluable aid in
the placing of this year's team at the
top of the pile in the stale, is the 1517
“fresh” eleven and their coach, Joe
Carter '14.

VVOI‘king under almost \Illsllrmount—
able difficulties, Carter developed a
team which showed rCftl football on
the two occasions on which it had a
Chance to prove what it could do.

Stilmlnrtls to uplinld

At the heglnnlng ol the Season a
large number of Gl'innell students (lid
not think that the 1917 freshman
eleven would hold up the high stan [—
arti set by the teams of 1916 and1915,
AS the season progressed, all doubts
as to the calibre Of this year's “irnsh”
were put m rest, and the doubters
began in take a different attitude
toward the freshmen,

Ahdut thirty men reported for place
tice the ﬁrst week of school, and after
two weeks of Work eighteen were ex-
empted from military drill that. they

1might give their whole attention to

football others who were not ex-

empted reported regularly on the

nights whcn they did not have drill.
(,‘rillie Illrt'fotl Clulinin

Kenneth Crane oi Algoua was elect-
ed captain about the middle of Octo-
bar, and a more deﬁnite line was got-
tell on the abilities of the different
mt‘u, so that a somewhat tentative
lineup was ready for the varsity to
attack do especially heavy line was
finelopcd, with Diehl and Turner on
tlit‘ wings, Olson and Winters at
tackle, Richards and Momyer at
guard, and Rowllnsou ﬁlling the cells
ter of the line. In the backﬁeld Crane
and Locke at halves, Haas nt lull, and
Johnson at quarter, make up the re~
mmndcr of the team,

This is only an arbitrary choice, as
Y ~ii, French, Vinsel, Clark, Holman,
ltiller, Linn and Nelson reported rege
lilal-ly all season. These men, altho
not on the tentative ﬁrst string,
showed that they had the goods when,
ever they were piit in the scrimmage
against the varsity.

Seen in Action Twice

Grinnoll football fans have been
more fortunate during the past sea,
son than were those of last year or
the year previous, in that they saw
the yearling team in action twice

during the 1911 season. in the ﬁrst
gulile, which was played against Shatr
tuck military academy, the “props"
showed that they had the real Grin-
ucll right. Aitcr being outplayed in
the first half of the game they staged
a real comeback in the second half
and won the game 13-7.

The fresh displayed the same old
ﬁght in tbc game against the varsity
in the game for the beneﬁt of the
local Red Cross. In this game they
scored one of the two touchdowns
which have been registered against
the varsity this year by straight foot»
ball, the other bcing made in the
Cornell game, when Cornell was given
the ball on Grinnell’s twoeyal'd line
with four downs to Cross the goal
line,

with the loss of the greater part or
this year's team by graduation, sev-
elal of the freshmen should make
strong bids for regular berths on the
varsity train next year. Having
lcamcd the fundamentals of the Min—
nesota system this fall, when Coach
Tollcfson was able to give them a lit-
tle time, they can devote their time
to learning the ﬁne points of the
game next fall. and make the 1913
scarlet and blaclr organization the
bcst in tlle history of Grinnell.

ELEVEN GRADUATE FRﬂM SQUAD

Prospects Not Dismal, However,
Because of Abundance of
Material

With clcven men graduating from a
squad of twenty-ﬁve, and with nine of
that eleven playing regular positions
in practically evcry game of the past
sfasoii, it would not seem that Grim
nell’s football prospects for the sea-
sun of 1918 would be overly brilliant,
As a matter of fact, however, there is
no need to hang crepe just at pres-
out, for things are not what they
might seem.

It is true that the absence of the
majority of the team that has played
together for three years ‘will cut down
on the team next year, but with the
material which is available at present
a team should be turned out which
will be nearly as good as the one this
ycar. or course, the war must be
considered as an important factor in
any prophecies, for there is no tell-
ing what will be the real situation
next fall.

Enils Look Good

The ends for next year will be fully
as plentiful as they were this year.
Dimit and MoMurray will both be in
school, and with this year’s experi-
ence behind them they should be 100
per cent better next year. In addition
to them, Diehl, Yarn, Turner and
