Script. Hampton. Va. The two gil‘

dents from Hampton here last year.

. . . From Gl‘mnell college Come Norma Mitchner and Calzloria

Lewis ,
Norma, a junior in the depart

Baltimore, Md.. seems especially impressed b

ment of phy 'col education, from
Grinneu's social

program, the seriousness and enthusiasm of Grinnellians toward

the exchange program and was J
cold weather. A lover of freedom.
in the women’s dormitory set-up
method was not practiced.

To Hampton, Norma bringsthe
idea oi cuiity among organiza
tions in the iorm of a grand mu-
sical. educational program or
talent revue which may be writ;
ten. produced and dil‘ected’Scle-
ly by the students.

To Norma. the exchange ex-
perience has been the great»
est source of maturity in all
her college career, but in or-
der tor the program to more
fully aehive§ its purpose she.
insists that it should he
tended to o iull year. She axe
plains that the adjustment pe—
l'jnd alone takes one semes—

ter, allowing little time for
substaing the friendships made
and examining the real fruits
oi the exchange.

Norma sums up the program
by saying. "Although the ex-
change is in its infancy and
could stand many improvements,
it is doing a wondoriul lob in
race relations. Whether the at-i
titude lound among Grinncllians‘i
toward the exchange was one oi
tolerance or brotherhood den
pended entirely upon the indlv
viduals, many of whom scented
to grow quite mature in their
ideas toward race relations by
the end of our stay on the cam.
pus.”

Caldoria. a junior in the di-
vision of home economics whoi
hails irom Montgomery, Ala, is‘
sure that the Gl'innell collcgc
campus luclts the natural beauty
of Hampton, but was especially
impressed hy thc Grinnellians
vohcmcnt interest in world at-
iairs and their enthusiasm. “is
tercst, alaerity and initiative in
the welfare and activities oi the
colleEe.

Although, like ours, the 1:017
lege is located in :1 small ,
town, she states that it is not as ‘,
remote trom the townspeople .
as is our campus.

Caldoria also found that Grin»
nell had a better organized slur
dent group for disciplinary probr
lcms in whose handS uas placcd
much power and authority to
bring charges and meet jusr

A young lady who cherishes
moments of meditation and hours
of concentration while studying.
shc recommends that Hampton
place more emphasis upon dorm
itoi-y quiet hours, the violation
ot which would be duly paid
for by the residents. Like Nor
ma, Caldoria also recommends
an annual allocampu day in
which the Hampto iy (dis.

could come togeth l in a cleans

activity for reunion, Finally,
