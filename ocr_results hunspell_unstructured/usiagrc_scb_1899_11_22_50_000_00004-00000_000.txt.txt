The meeting Saturday evening
was a success. both irom point oi
attendance and ot prtsentation ot
the program. Nearly all the mem~
bers of the society were present,
and also a number of visitors.

The ﬁrst number was given by
F. Meade, who recited “Pyramus
and Thisbe." This was the gen-
tleman's ﬁrst appearance on the
program and he did especially
well. '

The main teature ct the evening
was the presentation of two scenes
from “David Haruni." Five char
acters were represented: David
Hartlm, by Dickinson; John Len-
0x. by McCarty; Dick Larrabee,
by Hays; Bill Montaig, by Hays;
and Jack Smith, by Moller. The
scenes were Very much enjoyed
by the audience, particularly the
second, in which David relates his
experiences of a visit at the home
of his millionaire friend, Price.
Dickinson and Hays did especial-
ly well in the presentation of the
characters of David Harum and
Dick Larrabee.

The extemporaneous tvorlc was
well up to the standard, R. Pars
ker treated the subject, “Star
Showers.” Huntingspokebrieﬁy
but to the point on “Golf." Some
observations upon the probable

 

presidential candidate were given
by Crosby, Quaitc told the soci-
ety what he had to be thankful
for.

The debate wits one of the most

animated we have had this year. .-

[ntercollegtite lootbull was the
subject ot contcnflon» Williams
brought torth sortie strong argu-
ments in favor ot the game. The
competition involved in football
arouses some at the best qualities
of manhood. It gives physical
development. which is so essential
to the student. Intercollegiate
football is an aid in keeping up
the college spirits and also adver-
tises the College. Jones made out
an equally strong case against in-
tercollegiate football. He admit-
ted that it might help the individu-
al, but denied that it was a good
thing tor the college as a whole.
He emphasized the great danger
connected with the game. citing
the two deaths that have resulted
from it recently in this state. A
college is to promote the intellec-
tual welfare of the student. Mr.
Jones‘ argument called torth a

great deal of opposition. particu-
larly among the devotees of the
game, and most at the volunteer
speakers were on the at‘ﬁrmative
side ot the question. The presi-
dent decided tlte debate in favor
of the aFﬁrmative.
