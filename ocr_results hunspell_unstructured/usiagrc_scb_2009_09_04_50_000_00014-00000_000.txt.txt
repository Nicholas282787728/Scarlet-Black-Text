Speed, experience key for Pioneer game plan

Off—season training, new recruits and a home field advantage mean a new style of play, despite turnover, tough schedule

After .i 377 finish in 2008 and ‘rl long 0ft?
serison naiiiing regimen, the Giinnell foots
ball team retuins faster and more mature.
The team will rest the beneﬁts of theii work
for the ﬁrst time against Cornell College, at
1pm, this Saturday at home on Rosenbloom
Field.

Last year, the Pros
ncers beat the Rams by
just one point in a 26:25
thriller. This year, the
team is looking to make
a more definitive state»
meat in their season
opener

_ “We have ourprcpas
iation and our hard
work, we have the right
mind-set and that‘s to
go out and play our
game,"Caprain Marquis Bradley’ll said.

Grinnell’s game, thanks to Head Coach
Max Hawsey is all about speed Starting in
January, Coach Hawsey subjeeted his squad
to strength and speed training in order to
make sure his players were dedicated to irns
proving on last season.

“The guys were more aeeountable this
offsseason," Hawsey said, “Now that I’ve
been here a year and a half, they've bought in
to what we’re doing here,"

The outcome was a noticeably speedier
group. Defensive lineman and Captain cure
tis McCoy’lO sees the effects ofthe workouts
every day during practice.

”This is deﬁnitely tile fastest team
We seen in my four years. There’s
a Iatof really fast freshmen, mast-
/y at the skill positions, ”

“People are in a lot bettcr shape, fewer
people are getting hurt, people are not look-
ing for as many breaks," McCoy said. “And
during scrimmage you can deﬁnitely see
more swarming to the footballithcrc’s more
guys right there after the first hit to finish
the play."

The speed was not only earned through
hard work, but also impaired through re-
ctuiting.

“This is definitely
the fastest team I've seen
in my four years, right
end J‘oev Snyder 10 said

Theres a lot of really

fast freshman mostly at
the skill positions.”

l—lawsey brought an
entirely new system to
Grinnell college when
he took the head coach-
ing job in January of
2008 after leaving his post of offensive to:
ordinator at Colorado College. He calls his
offense the “shot-iun,” as it is a hurry up of—
fense and played out of the shotgun forma-
non.

“We want to get the ball in the hands of
a lot of different players,” l-lawsey said, "so
we can run the ball, make playaetion passes.
throw the ball deep and really give the ties
tense a lot or things to worry about."

The system relies heavily on the quar-
rerbaek to execute both through passing and
scrambling in search of success. (hiarterback

“My freshman year was a tough experi-
ence, but now I rea .c I am rcallv lucky to
have the year ofcxpcrience under my belt ale
ready,” Bogard said.

Coach Hawscy believes Bogard is pre:
pared to be the main man in his offense.

“He is a sophomore who rs playing like
a senioi—«he knows this offense really well,"
Hawsey said. “We ask him to run,we ask him
to throw, and ifhc’s playing well, then the or-
fense is doing well."

On the defensive sidc, thc team lost some
valuable seniors, most notably linebacker and
Midwest Conference recordssetting tacks
ler Brett Maloney ’09, Marquis Bradley '11
has stepped up, moving from free safety to
linebacker, to fill the gap left by Maloneys
absence.

“I knew I would be helping out the team,"
Bradley said. “so 1 was happy to make the
switch."

In addition, Linebacker John Hereford
’10, one of the leading tacklers from two
seasons ago, will return this year after being
sidelined for rnueh oflast season due to injus
ry. As a unit, coaeh Hawscy has few worries
about his defense.

”We lost some good defensive players,”
Hawsey said. “However, I feel like we are
better overall this year, from having to coach
against our defense being on offense everyday,
the defense is faster and more aggressive."

Grinnell follows Cornell College with
another home game against 5t. Norbert,
ranked second in the MWC pro-season poll,
at 1 pm. on Saturday, Sept 12th.
