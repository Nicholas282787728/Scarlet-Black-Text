THE WORK that is being done
this tall in the young men's sue
cieties of the academy is (or ironi
being up to the standard. There
is usually considerable interest
taken in tile society work by the
members of the two societies and

‘ a healthy reeling oi rivalry gener-
ally exists which causes more de»
termined work on the part of
both. This fall, however, one
society seems to have dropped
out of existence and left whatever
of work there isto be done to its
rival. This is anything hut the
proper spirit to show. The echo.
tits of society work have been
suFﬁciently dwelt upon in these
columns 50 that we refrain from
saying more} along this line. but
it should be considered by all at
the academy societies that upon
them and their works depends in
large degree the success of the
college societies. As the students
enter the college irom the acad-
emy the question of whether or
not they shall take up society
work naturally p‘rescnts iiseli
to them, but it is too often the
case that those who have taken
active part in this work in the
academy are the only ones to
enter the larger societies. For
this reason it rests upon the
academy students to see that their
society is of the highest grade.
The joint debates and oratorical
contests which have usually been
held between the Leuis Literary
and Philologian Soaeties have
always been a greatinspiration
and spur to their society work
and it is to be sincerely hoped
that these contests will beheld
this year. The academy is sui
ﬁciently large to support
young men’s societies and
