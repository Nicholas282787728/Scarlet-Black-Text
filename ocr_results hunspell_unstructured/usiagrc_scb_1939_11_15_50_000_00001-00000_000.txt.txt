Britt Predicts
Chaos If Free
Thought Dies

“It is impossible for the uorltl
to burn without the lives of each
of us being seriously directed,"
said .Dr. Albert Britt, former-
president of Knox college, in an
Armistice day speech in Herrick
chapel Friday night.

He went on to say that the
idea of a univcrsal bond substane
tiates the view that internation-
ahsm is a preferable policy to nae
tionalism when concerned with
the frce trade of ideas, His spcccn
illustrated the necessity for pres-
ervation of the universality of
thought, and the importance of
international cooperation in thinle
ing.

“If, at the end of this war, the
flee exchange of ideas is not re-
stored to the point where it stood
at the outbreak," he concluded,
"the resulting chaos will over
shadow all previous depths into
which civ ation has been

Dr. Luccock Finds Realism in Depression Literature Trend
When Contrast‘ed With ‘l/Veallh—Begetting’ Twenties Decade

 

Dl', Halford E. Luccock, p10—
fessor of homilctics at Yale uni»
versity, opened the Gates lecture
series with an address entitled
”The Valley of the Shadow"
Tuesday morning in Herrick cha
pcl before an assembly of both
students and visiting ministers,

Dr. Luccock outlined the trends
in literature through the depres
sion decade, andcoiitrastcd tlrem
with tirose of the postwar years
and the "wealth-begetting" decade
of the '20s.

Interpreting the literature of
the '30' Luccock said, “Creative
literature is never an accurate
mirror of contemporary life. It is
bound to be full of distortions,"

The social, economic, and poli-
tical movcrncnts of Lhose past 10
years have been reﬂected in the
litcrature of the period. He

pointed out that literature should‘
have its place in shaping the fue
turc, and concluded by saying that
“unless we live like brothers, we
cannot livc at all.”

That the dcprcs, on has lirouglit
modern literature back to realism
was the theme of the second
Gates lecture by Dr. Luccock, He
reviewed the field of American
regional literature in an address
entitled “The Candid Camera at
Work.“

Never have clear-er lenses been
trained on all the nooks and corn-
crs of the life of America, he
said,

Quoting Dr, Edward A. Steiner
of thc Gr-innell college faculty, Luc-
cock said that the only illiteracy
Jcsus cvcr condemned was an in-
ability to read the signs of the
times. “The signs of the times

l
l
l
l

are spelled in large, clear letters
in fiction, in some drama, and in
poetry. Wc conic under Jeslls'
condcmnation of a vicious illiter-
acy if wc don’t try to read.”

The real danger of a group like
the college students here is that
they may live hchind barricades
when the increasing of awareness;
to life is the whole story of our
exrstcncc, according to the Yale
professor.

Luccock devoted the greater,
part of the talk to short l'cViewsl
of sectional novels, showing the,
realism of the modern literature,
of the depression years as Con-
trastcd with the literature of the
“roaring twenties".
