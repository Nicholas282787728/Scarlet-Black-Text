“RUSSIA AND HER PROBLEMS."

Dr. Steiner Gives Exceiiem Leciure for
the Beneﬁt oi the Uncle Sam's club
iAuendance Fair.

Seldom has Dr‘. Steiner been heard
to better advantage than last even-
ills”r in his beneﬁt lecture on “Russia
and Her Problems" for the aid of the
Uncle Sam's Club. The subject is an
especially attractive one at. this time
when the eyes of the world are turned
towards Russia and her troubles, but
in the hands or Dr. Steiner, the per-
sonal friend of the great Tolstoy, the
traveler, and the keen student of
Russian aﬂ‘airs, it becomes doubly in-
teresting and the audience acquired a
better understanding of and insight.
into the eastern Situation than could
be obtained by months of dcsultory
magazine and neivspnperreadilig. Tile
lecture showed the intimate know-
ledge and comprensive outlook that
comes only irom personal observation
and study. The lecturer knew Where-
oi he spoke.

Dr. Steiner began alter abriet in-
troduction by Professor Parker, by re-
form; to the present great war and to
the rapid decline of Russia's standing
in the eyes or the world. The, Siav,
he said, has never held the same terri-
tory long. Russia's present. problems
are due to three primary causes. USE.)
the natural characteristics of the peo-
ple. (2nd) their social conditions.
(3rd.) their political and' religious
life. The lecture naturally fell into
these three divisions.

The people, from their earliest hiss
(my, have always followed the lines of
least resistance, and sought to avoid
struggles. They have no great epics
of war, no great. hero, no songs of
migrations, no ideals of conquest, no
colonization. The patience and lack
of passion or the peasant explain why
he has not sought revolution. He has
no love of beauty. no originality nor
desire for learning but is the crudest
or human material. Yet belies many
coarse pleasures and is always good
natured.

The mir system of government was
then sketched, showing the primitive
reatures and the grinding poverty
which oppresses the inajeek. The hap-
pier side or their dreary, monotonous
lives was not neglected but Dr. Stein-
er described in detail their interesting
ceremonies attendant in love, birth
and marriage.

Their political condition is piLiable
and the government is honey-combed
With corruption. Their religion is
spectacular but impractical. They
have the poetry but not the prose of
Christianity. Only a new passion for
the right, can bring about a change for
the better. In closing Dr. Steiner
ventured the prophesy that Russia
would have peace insidcoiamontll,
some kind of acoustitution within
two years and that ﬁve years more

 

will see the doom oi the autocracy.

THE MACY CLUE

Principal Zcigler Gives rt Paper concern.
ing Free Text Book Syskcm~5omc
uii‘is Acruai Working.

Monday afternoon at the rcgulal‘
meeting oi the Macy Club Principal
T. H Zoigler and Supt. Thorhburg of
the G iniicll schools gave a very inter-
esting discussion of “The Free Text
Book System." A paper on the sub-
jeCt was prepared by Mr. Zeiglcr and
Mr. Thornburg assisted him in the
general discussion that followed. Tile
System has been in operation here
since 1901 and the gentlemen were
able to give personal accounts of the
working 0! the System.

The general plan is as follows: The
school board furnishes books for all
pupils from the tax supporting the
contingent school fund. They are
then issued for use through the super-
intendent, principal and teachers. A
record of each book is kept anda
small ﬁne collected hour the pupil [or
any unnecessary damage. At the end
of the term the books are returned to
the superintendent.

The arguments in mo: of such a
system are,7that every child has
equal advantages, that the burden of
the cost' falls upon the heavier proper-
ty holders instead of On the individual
family, that the change of books is
less Irerluent and better books are
supplied; and the money expended for
them is less. The arguments against it
arc—that infectious deseusas may be
carried in the books, that there is no
individual owner’s pride and the
public books will be misused. Carer
ful watch is maintained, however, and
books known to contain desease germs
are eithcz destroyed or disinfected.
iii-,Tliornbui-g brought out in his re-
marks that there isa certain pride
in the neatness with which the books
arekept,a line being held as a dis-
grace and objected to on that ground

rather than as ﬁnancial loss.

In preparing his paper Mr. Zeigler
wrote the superintendents oi the var-
ious schools throughout Iowa now
using this system. He received about
fifteen answers. The following are
the questions and answers:

When was the system adopted,7
1897 to 1%3.

Average cost to pupil,—SOC to :
a year.

Average life of text,7li\'e years.

Do you have the Line system,—yes
but With small revenue.

Give your estimate ol the working
or the System,— voorl. except. in one in-
Stance.

Does the system promote careful.
hess.—no, ‘

In the matter of ﬁnes the Grinnell
schools have been more {Oitunate than
other schools throughout the state i'or
the income from that source has been
quite material.

The worst feature OK the system is
the extra work thrown on the beach-
ersin keepingn record or each book
and the lines.

The Grinnell schools did not adopt
any one company’s books but go upon
the market and buy, better books he

TH E NEW CATALOGUE.

l2. No. 47

Another luwa College Bulletin Ready
ior DisiribuiinniSomc Changes in
the Courses ior cht Year.

The catalogue for this year, known
as No. 2 of the third volume of the
lowa College Bulletin, has appeared
this week. Vei-yicw changes were made
over lusty ar’s production but one or
two featllr have been added and
some new courses or study oirercd.

It, will be remembered that the ﬁrst
portion of the book last year was
given over to papers upon etlllcaii'l >l
topics while the descriptive catiililcile
proper was appended as a supplement.
This year the entire volume is occu-
pied solely with, the catalogue, the
other matter being included in the fall
bulletin. Another Slight change for
the better is to he noticed in the ar-
rangeineut of the topics included un-
der “General Iuiol'matio .” The his»
torioal Statement is this year used as
an introduction to the main body of
the work instead of being included un-
der the above head and there is also
added a brief chronological statement
giving the dates of the main events
in Grinnell’s Hist/Dry from the ﬁrst
organizationoftheBoardoiTrllsteesin
1846 to the erection of the Carnegie
Library.

In place of fourteen groupslastyeur.
sixteen are ofierod this year. In place
of the ninth Group last year, which
olIered as majors Political Science and
History or Philosophy, there is this
year a History-Philosophy and a Polic
ical Science-Philosophy group. The
additional group is number ten in
which two majors may be chosen from
Economics, History and Political
Science, this is a long needed course
and will doubtless prove an exceeding-
ly popular one in the years to come.

In several of the courses changes
are announced.

Doctor Steiner oiiei-sa new course
in Personal work and iii the making
and delivering or serinrins. Doctor
Fink gives a course in General Plant
Morphology and Doctor IIeudrixsoll
will discontinue h'is elective courses
in Physical Chemistry and in Metal-
lurgy and iissaying. The department
or economics is outlined in iull, orier-
ing minor, major and elective courses.
Doctor Stoops in his post major course
in philosophy will give a systematic
treatment of some Groups'of Prob-
iems or authors. In his elective
course's he will other a term in Educa-
tional Psychology.

In general the catalogue is much
clearer and more satisfactory than
previous catalogues have been,

Mrs. Isobel Gai'g’hill Beecher has
long been rccogni. d as a reader or
established standing. Shehasappeaiu
ed belore audiences from one end of
the country to the other and has al-
ways enjoyed the some uniform suc-
cess. She isliot unfamiliar to Grin-
ueil audiences as she appeared here in
1901 iii a number on the lecture course
andgave very fine satisfaction. As
she is said [’0 be very much better this
yeartlinn she was then her audience
may expect an entertainment of hiizh
order. She Will be in Gi'iilncll next
Wednesday evening in the Congregi -
Lional church and will give the last
number on the Y. M. C. A. Lecture
Course.

Numbers for choice of seats may be
drawn at Alley‘s all day Monday and
