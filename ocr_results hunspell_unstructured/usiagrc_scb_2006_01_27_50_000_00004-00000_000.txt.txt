The same joke, just progressively grosser

This week, learn about immigration policies get a taste for foreign sci- -fi or revel in poop jokes

The Aristocrats (R)

So, I'm this movie reviewer, and I tell my readers,
“Have I got a movie for you! It’s the most relentless
90 minutes ofyour lierou’ll be bombarded from all
sides with the tilthiest jokes youve ever heard ExV
pbcrt rruagerv of feces incest, bestiality and combina-
tions of the three will become so common that you
will not bat an eye at their every mention Comedians
will show you why they are the most twisted people
on this planet as their dirtiest joke (usually told only
in their inner circles) is ﬁnally revealed to the public
A couple ofpeople might think this dirtyjokc is the
funniest thing to ever grace the comedic landscape,
but most people will be simply too horriﬁed to laugh
at what really isn’t that funny in the first place,"

“What's it called?" the readers say

“The Aristocratsl"

Yes, this documentary by Paul Provenzsr and Penn
Gillette (of Penn and Teller fame) is unspeakably
dirty That may be enough to convince some to go
see it. Provenza and Grllettc rrilervrew nearly 100 cc-
medians to get their thoughts and renditions or The
Aristocmts." The formula of the joke itself works
much like the above paragraph: a family, consisting
of a mother, father, son, daughter and dog walk into
a talent agent's office They proclaim that they have
this grcat family act and then demonstrate it with all
sorts of excess (this excess is improvised by whoever
is telling the joke). When asked what the act is called,
they reply, The Aristocrars."

The joke itselfis not funny its the spin that each
comedian prrts on the Joke that is supposed to make
it funny. The big problem is that too many ofthc ctr
medians just interpret the joke as away for them to
be as dirty as possible. A quality dirty joke is an art
form, as the documentary explains and then proves
true as numerous comedians provide little variation to
the jokes formula, swearing excessively and providing
vivid descriptions of lewd acts sure to send the weak—
stomached out the door. The problem is, their dirty
descriptions are also not that ﬁrmly.

When there rs variation, it’s funny not because of
the joke itself, but rather because ora particular varias
tion or because preconceived notions about a eertam
comedian being shattered Kevin Pollalt performs the
joke as Christopher Walken which is pretty funny, ex-
eep t I would Vc laughedjust as hard ithe read excerpts
from War and Peace with the same voice. Theres a
card trick variation, a perrorinanee by a mime and an
Amish interpretation, all of which are funny in spite
orthe joke, not because orit.

Finally, there's Bob Saget, who hopes to destroy
any and all preconceived notions about Bob Saget.
I-lis version of the joke is painfully unfunny, brrt the
thought ofDannyTanncr dropping the fsbomb brings
the belly laughs Saget probably desires.

In all, T/Jt Ai-istomm isn't really shocking as much

as it is dcscnsrtlzlng. At the beginning ofthc movie, “" P'“

I wasn’t laughing, probably because r was too horn-
fied at the details of the joke to let out a chuckle, By
the end of the movie, I \vrsnt laughing bcc rusc I was
bored I was sick of the straightforward joke, rrnrrfs
fected by copious amounts of piss and excrement and
desperately hoping that the docrrrnentary would actu-
ally allow a comedian to tell a jokc straight through
without cutting to someone clse’s eontraenttry and
ruining the flow that the joke desperately needs.
Don't get me wrong, I did think that Tb: ﬂristut‘l'lllr
has its moments, just not enough of them, others
may think differently, doubling over in laughter at the
umpteenth retelling ofthejoke. I’ll be with the rest of
the audience, quietly scratching my head.
