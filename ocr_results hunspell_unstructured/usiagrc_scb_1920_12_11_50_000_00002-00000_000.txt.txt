After all, in discussing the \\I‘ll)‘ and
the whereiore of this
campaign, the real argument is not
that Glinnell is a good college, and
deserves money. It is not that Grllk
nell nieds money because 01‘ this and
that reason, The real argument, is
that she MUST have it. That alone
is enought to inalie anyone who real-
ly is proud of his collcge go out and
get it.

We argue that
money to build buildings, to pay Pros
fessors, to meet me rising costs. We
point out the difference in purchasing
power of the dollar. We show that
we are not a rich college in the tie
nancial sense of the word. After we
think we have proved that the money
is badly needed, we start out to show
that of all colleges in the country,
none is more worthy than this col-
iege. We cite the results of the sci-u—
tiny of the General‘ Education Board.
We quote the flowery words or praise
from the lips of Mr. Buttel‘ick, head
of the General Education Board. We
dig up all our old records, hoth schol-
astic and athletic, and otherwise. All
Drove conclusively that no amount
that could be raised would ever be
too much, and then as a final touch,
we “tell the world” all about that big

the real reason we are going out to
bring in the million? it is notl We
are going out because we find some
thing which is a part of us, something
of which we are a part, sufieriug from
lacls of that which keeps it going. The
truth of the old saying— “you can't
live on love", could not be more
graphically shown by any other ex-
ample. Every student lives for his;
college. The college is a part of him,
students and iaculty niche up the col-
lege. It is a sad truth, however, that
sentiment will not keep things going,
and someone has to go to work to
support the family.

BROADEN OUT
(From Michigan Daily)

Herbert Hoover, foi-incr food admiue

conference of the executive council of
the Ameiican chcration or Labor.
showed his broad viewpoint when he
rctused to place all
Imeseht industrial conditions on either
‘lnlmi' capital. lie admitted that
the employers were partially to blame
‘but he refused to concede to the fed-
eration that the laborers didn‘t havc
a hand in the trouble also.

Ml'. Hoover showed himself to be
leapahle of looking at both sides of

the blame for

through the eyes of another as well as
through his own. It is- this sort or
ability and this degree of imagination
which mark u man as one who is well
leducdted iii the highest sense of the
word.

, We, as college students, should Dos»
sess ourselves ol‘ this same bl'ozttlness
uf mind, or at least we should show
,signs of some day being capable of
,looking at a matter iroin two or more

 

‘anglcs and thus rendering a really
,valuahle decision. Are most of us of
this sort, or are we continually zillmlvu
ling ourselves to slip into narrow nah-
‘its of thinking, whereby we can see
‘only our side of a problem?

That is the question, and it is a

many of us. We are inclined to re—
strict ourselves to our own vicw en-
tirely, and we thus tend to break
down the influence of such broadeir
lug subjects as we may study.

The trouble is not with the college
education; it lies with us. We have
the opportunity, tinder the present
college elective system, to choose for
ourselves the courses which we take,
and to decide what subjects will he
