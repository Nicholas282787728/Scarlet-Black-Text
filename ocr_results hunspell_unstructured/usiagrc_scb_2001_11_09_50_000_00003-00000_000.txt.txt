My favorite book is Go Deg, Go by ED. Eastman. It's a children’s book
about dogs ofall dilTerent shapes and sizes and colors who come together
to party in a big tree in the middle ornowhare. This story gives examples

how to make a name jam when everybody drives alone in their ears, and
how to party in are without railing out, The book also includes very
useful fashion advice, employing stimulating dialogue sueh as, “Do you

My favorite novel is Persuasion by Jane Austen. 1 think Austen manages to

words and very little aetioii. anarian ronveys heartbreak, romanee. and
longing all at once, and even though I’m a historian who values eontett, I
think the book does a really good job ofreaehing across the years to touch
the reader. A elose second, for me, would be the novels ofPatriekO'Brian,
sspeeially Parr Captain, his second book, which is an homage to I’m“!!-

While I hesitate to single out a single book, l have to say that one ofmy
favorite pieees erlitaraturr for many years now has been a novel by the
German poet Rainer Maria RJlk: entitled, T/reNoalro/o ofMalrr'erioids

ofthe novel's appeal to me is that I read it while I was a stranger on my

found it one of the most rewarding I guess iftliere is a story about it, it’s
that it taught me to be more patient when I read. to give myselrtime to
enjoy what i read. Most orall, it demonstrated to me the power oflanc
