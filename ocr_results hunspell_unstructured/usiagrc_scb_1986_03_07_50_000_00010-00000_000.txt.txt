I was a bit lost at first trying to decide

hat to put into this column. Having never

rainstorming, I decided that i would
.evote my first column to my former
r rceptions of athletics at Grinnell. as up
i used to what they are today.

The high school I attended suffered the
l isfortune of having its athletes labeled as
‘dumh jocks" by other students, which
_ave us a poor team image among other
chools we competed against. When I ar-

people tried to persuade me otherwise,
that athletes here concentrated all their
nergy on athletics, and that very little of
their time went towards hitting the books.
(Then again, little did I realize how much

One of the main reasons my Views
tarted to change was that I ran cross~
ountry that year, encouraged by my
oommate. While my collegiate running
areer lasted only a few short weeks, it
as a long enough time for me to realize

at athletes here are in a different class

an most others (especially those at the
l igh school level).

While athletes here do take their sports
eriously, just as much effort goes int

athletes are fortunate to have access t

facilities in the Midwest, as well as a
tremendous group oi coaches, willing t.

Henry Vogelman‘s 46’ 4 and 7/ B" victory

momentum which enabled the men to
place third with 110 points, closely follow-
ing Coe’s 116 and Cornell‘s 120. Greg
Evans had two wins on the day — an ex-
citing 1000 yard finish (2:23.78) and a
record-breaking mile (4:25.73). Paul Mc-
Combs captured the 880 win in 2:01.44.
while teammate Rob DeLong ﬁnished 4th

Lawson, the women finished 2nd with 113

' points, behind only William Penn‘s 148.

Danielle raced to Ist. in the 60 hurdles
(11.66) and to 2nd, as well as setting a new
record, in the 600 (1:31.43). Chris dashed 60
yards in 7.53 for Ist and stretched for a
15's" long jump for 4th. Kim Kuncl placed
in three evens: 2nd in triple jump (31’1
1V4"); 4th in the 60 (7.133); and 5th in the
300 (41.65). Shavaun Adams finished 2nd
and 3rd in the 2-mile and mile runs.
Veronika Platzer put the shot 33’6V2 in

her first competition this season for 2nd,-

and Amy Amabile’s effort ofal’lll/z" eam-
ed her 4th. Karen Drinkwater surpassed
her personal best to place 4th in high jump
(4'4"), while long jumpers Frances Lila
jedahl and Kristen Richert leapt to 4th
(15’) and 6th (13’2") places.

Mary Lanaghan's 3rd place moo yard
clocking of 3:09.53 was followed by
Michelle Kosmidis’ 6th place time
(3:37.15). Sara Farnham and Karyn Skaar
finished 4th in their respective events, the
600 and 380, while Malinda Collins dashed
to 6th place in the 440. The mile and 2-mile
relays rounded oii the scoring by iinishing
2nd and 3rd.

Coach Will Freeman expressed some
surprise at the day’s results, which include
ed 31 personal records (or the teams,
especially since the training leading into
the meet was me “most intense of the
season”.

Freeman reported that attitude con-
tinues to be a major factor in the teams’
successes, and that mental training has
become just as important as physical
preparation. And indeed, the pioneers
practice this mental training as a team
three times a week, The effects of this are
very obvious to men’s teams cocaptain
Bill Strean, who reported “In four years of
Grinneli track, I've never seen the per»
vasive positive attitude that presently ex-
ists.”

The Pioneers are competing at con-
ference tonight and tomorrow in Chicago,
and both squads will be factors in the
determination of respecu‘ve champion-
ships. The men have never finished above
4th in the conference but Will Freeman
feels that this the year to start a new trend.
The women are defending their title as
conference champs, and have every
reason to expect retention of the honor.

The 1985-36 Men’s Tennis Team is all set
to volley, lob, and smash their way to vic-
tory as they prepare to open their season
Wednesday, March 13, in a dual meet
against Wartburg.

According to head Coach John Pfitsch,
this year’s team is looking very strong;
team members are playing with as much
intensity as last year’s team. Last year’s
team did very well, finishing 4th in the con»
rerence behind conference powers Ripon,
Chicago, and Lawrence.

This year’s team is currently made up of
21 members. While the Pioneers lost their
top 2 singles players, Dan Silversmith and
Mark cloud, to graduation, many ex-
perienced players do return from last
year’s team; junior Fred Christians and
Dave Robertson, and sophomores Phil
