Reel Tape Tangle?
There is 2i committee on campus
riled the faculty committee on student or-
ganization. It is composed of two inculty
‘ embers, tl 'ee administrative officers, and
ienr student's. Its chairman is Karl B.
Dearborn, dean of personnel administration.
Through this committee must pass for
a’lproval the Student Council semester fee

The committee on student organizm

its year's activities on Oct 8, yet only
list Wednesday was the review of the
Student Council constitution begun.

Still to be decided by the committee is

An Open Reply

“This is not an indication of an ap-
poaching tuition increase. There will be

“ , r . . decided to raise the costs of

200 for the year 194849.”

that students on this campus (the vast maA

education, not for luxurious living. .

Tlic filial page of this morning's letterE
hinted that the increase might “work a‘
hardship” on some students. To offset this.
inevitability we suggest a revised and eX<|
panded system of scholarships, loans and
student employment so that the hardship
will be reduced to a minimum.

It is felt that the entire educational
system here is being dealt a slow bllt pere
sistent body blow from which it may never
permanently recover. For many, education
may once again become unattainable if the
present trend continues.

Who'll Pay The Rent?

The men’s intramural system at Grin-
nell is “broke”. At present it still lacks the
money. needed to buy trophies for the comrl
illg year. This is a surprising situation con-
sidering the stress both administration and
students lay on the program. What has

done about it 7

Budget Trouble

The lack of funds is caused by the cut,
iii the physical education budget. Men's
intramurals are financed iinder the allot-
ment given to physical education; but, be
cause the college requires a definite phvs-
ical education program the cost of which r —
mains nearly the same from year to year,
any out in its budget is hard on intramulals.

This year the cut from $1100 to $600
left intramurals with just half their pretl»
ous allotment. That cut necessitates a pa
ing of physical education expenses to the
bone. (If the diving board breaks during thel
year, which it shows every indication oil
doing, there will be no money with \l'hichi
to replace it). Moreover, there is no shar-i
ing of costs. The money spent on physical
education buys no equipment for intramure
all use, and vice versa.

Not Just Intramurals

Some may point to the fund n
men’s athletics alid sayi‘Look ~it all tint
money! Why can’t intercollegiate spoits‘
help the intramurals?” A football team
which practices in fractions of jerseys,
lacking leplzlcements for the worn ones,l
could hardly take an expense cut. And the‘
same thing holds true for the othel sports
as well, none of which have enough on uhich]
to run. ,

Where then is this money going to
come from? The sem fee cannot cut 2m) ‘
where else to aid intramurals. The C of HPl
could help some but not enough.

Therefore, the physical education bud-
get must be given a definite boost from tliei,
college treasury. it is up to those who run}
the intramural system to see that the ph;
sical education budget takes adequate care
'of intramulals. ‘

Student interest iii intramurals isl
shown by the time spent on them, and both
the president and the faculty have come
