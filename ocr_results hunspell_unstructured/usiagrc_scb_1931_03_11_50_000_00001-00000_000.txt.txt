Singing ‘Fresh’
Friday Evening

Assist

in Concert;

Orchestra, Soloists

Women
Setting Aids

“Surpassing even the high Stands
ards which the Women’s glee club has
cherished in the t\Vany~four years of
its existence. the home concert March
7 marked new attainments in
clear, fresh, and flexible singing," re
marked Henry W. Matlack. “In a
program of as much variety as is
possible for Women's voiccs, ranging
from Palestrina to H. W, Parker,
they not only sang but gave a vivid
and enthusiastic interpretation of
each number, singing both n. capella
and with piano or orchestral accom-
paniment with equal effectiveness."

In addition to the group songs by
the organization, Ruth Goodenow
played a violin solo, “Romance."
(Svendsen); Eunice Cutler an organ
solo, “Fantasy on Erin’ Feste Burg"
(Faulkes); and Alice Richards a
piano solo, "Lotus Land," (Scott).

In the concluding group, "Seven
Greek Pastoral Scenes (Parker),
Margaret Skelton and Winifred Kelch
were soloists. Mr. Matlack says of
this offering. “The closing number,
Parker's ’Seven ‘Green Pastoral
Scenes,‘ called for ensemble and
solos. with small orchestral accomn
paniment. The orchestra consisted of
strings and woodwinds, and the result
was exquisite.”

An appropriate setting for the con-
cert was furnished by white picket
fences which were built along the
back of the stage, with an arch at
the center, through which the sings
ers entered. The picket fences and
arch were banked with spring flow-
ers. These, with the pastel tints of
the gowns worn by the women, were
a colorful addition to the music.

Friends Erect W

to Commemorate Grade-Pirate; Nature hikes m
st Disappearing

Old Trade Fa

0n Gl‘innell's green campus. north
of the Music ball and south of Rand
gymnasium, is a lonely grave. It is
a new grave, for the earth is freshly
heaped theron, no grass has sprung
thereat, A modest wooden marker
at its head bears this inscription:

HERE LIES

JOSEPHUS COLLEGIUM
HE CRlBBED
'I‘SK!

The simple eloquence of this quiet
memorial is more than an expression
of identity and fate, it is symbolic of
the dying out of a beloved race of
rascals, the passing away of the old
guard. Not content that their com-
rade should lie on unhallowed ground,
in an unmarked resting place, valiant
ruffrans stole upon the spot in dead
of night, bearing the gravestone they
had carved upon, to erect it thus even
at peril of their lives.

Josephus Collegium, king of cribb-
ers, is dead, and with him perisbes a
loyal band of traditional gradespir-
ates. Even while it is better so, one
cannot help mourning the untimely
death of this renegade at the hands

ooden Marker

of his destroyers, nor admiring the
valor of the retainers who risked
their heads to honor him. No more
can daylight robbery be committcd at
examination time; the trade is help
less without its chieftsin. A threat-
ened crime wave has been turned
aside and a new era is at hand. Even
while they know it had to he, upper
classmen cannot pass the grave with»
out a catch of the throat, and many
a hard-hearted professor has shed a
silent tear for the dead

However that may be, it is an age
of speed, of progress. This generation
will not tolerate piratic conquest and
so must on to more novel means of
prpmotion. Off with the old, on with
the new. Still, it seems, there ought
to he grass growing there, perhaps a
rose or two; in reverence to the de-
censed let no man tread upon that
spot.

It has been suggested that a marble
monument replace its cruder prede~
cessor, but further consideration con—
vinces one that after all, the wooden
marker must remain. It was erected
by Josephus' friends in anguish and
despair, and they would have it so.

Frank Lowden Finds Truth in Myth;
Jay Sigmund Writes of Sordid Farm

Tanager Articles Opposed;
Students Write Poems
in March Issue

By DALE McCAY

Almost diametrically opposed in
the general tenor of their treatment
are the two pieces of writing on farm
life in the March issue of the Ten
ager. The first. “The Good Life and
the Form,“ by Frank 0. Lowdeh,
former governor of lllinois, calls a/t-
tentlon to the necessity for human
Society's keeping its contact with the
earth.

Isn’t. there something everlasting-
ly true in the myth of Antaeasi"
asks the author. “He was often over—
thrown, but whenever he touched the
earth, his strength was miraculously
renewed."

Realistic Dennis Shown

Mr. Lowden concludes his discus—
sion of practical farm problems, be-
gun in the preceding issue of the
magazine, with the statement: “All
of these practical problems are very
real ones, and demand our earnest
attention. But the solution of them

. is only a means to an end, that
of opportunity for those living on

 

 

our farm. to live the good life,"

The story, Man Servant.‘ by Jay
Sigmund, gives the opposite point of
view. With characteristic exactness
Mr. Sigmund places his finger on
realistic details and interprets them
with an equally characteristic sordid-
ness.

The members of the Grinnell col-
lege verse-writing class have furnish-
ed the poetry for this issue. Notable
among these are "Stay Summer
Night,” by Dorothy coble Dreese,
“Query,” by Stanley Hipp. and "To
a. Cloud," by Alfred Canal-d. The
latter is interesting because of its
use of the verse form made famous
by George Meredith in his “Love in
the Valley."

liocttol Author of Sketch

Other Student contributions are “A
School in the Cumberlands," a lively,
vivid sketch of school life among the
poor whites in the south, by Kathryn
Goettei and the Demi—Tasse section
ccntai ing two essays and a poem by
freshmen Students. These latter fall
somewhat below the standard usually
Set for Tanager contributions.

Faculty representation in the cur-
rent issue is secured througb two
interesting book reviews, Sir James
Jeans’ ”The Mysterious Universe,"
reviewed by Prof. William J. Rusk,
and Frank mast Hill’s translation
of Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales,” re-
viewed by Prof. Paul Spencer Wood.

Duke Takes Six Athletes;

six men with him to the Illinois re-
lays this weekend. The men making

the mile relay team, while Mcilrath
and Filbrow will run the 1500-meter

Last year Mcilrath placed second
in this race against strong competi»
tion, and he also placed in every
event he entered except the mile.
While he has not been up to top
form this year because of an opera-
tion early in the season, Coach Duke
expects him to place.

This meet ends the indoor track
season for the Pioneers. The next
meet will be April 11, when Cri -
nell opens its outdoor season with
a home meet here.

A lantern projector which enables
the instructor to operate lantern
slides and lecture before his class at
