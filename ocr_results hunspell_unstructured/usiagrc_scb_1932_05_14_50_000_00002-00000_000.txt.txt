THE “ELIJAH”

Tlle presentation of Selections from the Grill-
llell college vosper choir, at vespe tomorrow af-
ternoon, will culminate a successful year for that
organization. It is only fitting that the choir, which
has fol-”years been a nationally recognized feature
of Gi-lnnell. should be commended on its esperially
outstanding work this year as a regular oolltrihu-
for to the vesper hour.

During: the year, members of the choir have
on three occasions, presented outstanding oratorios,
including ”Messiah", by Halide], “Sevl‘ll Last
lVords of Christ”, by Dilhois, and “God’s Tillie is
the Best”, by Bach. The “Elijah”, by Mendelssohn,
will make the fourth.

Milt-h of this success has been due to the, (“I'M--
tion of Elias Bluill, professor of the theory of music.
who has Spent unlimited time with the choir. and
to the cooperation of a specially selected olrllostra.
composed of students alld faculty, whivvh has as-
sisted on these occasions.

Of tomorrow’s production Professor Blum
has said, “\ to the ‘Mcssiall’, the ‘Elijah’,
is without question the most popular of tlle great
oratorios the w 'ld ove'. Thi 's due to the won-
derfully expressive, yet melodious, music used to
enhance the story of that greatest of all prophets
of ancient Israel. Indeed so dramatic and \" al are
both the story and music that with a very few lllllll-
bel's omitted. the work finds few operas to exoell it
ill this regard.

HIll the performance of‘Suliday afternoon.
three of the outstanding episodes ill the life of
the fiery prophet are presented ill their entirety,
and together, make a very complete presentation
of the essentials of the work, The three year
drought, with the subsequent contest between the
Elijah and the Priests of Baal. Nothing in all ora-
torio can be, compared to thi scene. Tl s is follow-
ed by the exquisite prayer for rain ulth the oil-
eoniing of the, torrents that “lave the thirsty land.”
Finally the touchillgly human scene of Elijall’s
despair “beneath the Juniper tree.” and the com-
fort of the angc . l ll this conveyed ill a succession
of inllllortal tune universal favorites among mu-
Sic loving people of all lant..

ON ABOLISHING FINAL EXAMS
(From the Dliily Trojan)

Budgets are not the only thing that are being slash-
ed in the educational world today. Curricula, both of
the secondary schools and of the colleges, are being
revised. New educational theories are being tried out,
and conventional policies are being discarded. ,

Rollins college of Florida was established and is
functioning on a completely revolutionized idea of higbcr
education; Harvard is being Oxfordized by the tutorial
system; Chicago has abolished compulsory class at-
tendance for certain select students and allows them to
advance as rapidly as their progress justifies, Now
word comes from the University of pcnnsylvania that
final examinations have been abolished,

Without full details of this latest plan, we cannot
say just how far this abolition extends, but it is another
of the experiments that are being tried out,

For many years, the whole question of final exam-
inations has been a much mooted point out of the wel-
ter of arguments pro and can that debaters use on
the subject, one point in the favor of eliminating exam-
inations persists, that they are not wholly dependable
gauges of individual knowledge and ability. Ever since
psychologists have said that even idiots may possess
remarkable memories, as witness Blind Tom, the Negro
pianist, our respect for the memory feats required by
certain types of examinations has been somewhat ini-
pared.

The mental and nervous strain of examinations cer-
tainly engenders or aggravates neurotic tendencies in
students. Another evil of the examination system is that
it sometimes encourages sloth by making it possible for
the lazy student to recupemte his scholastic status at
the eleventh hour by cramming for the final. The tempta-
tion to be dishonest is increased by the vital importance
of final examinations to the student.

That all tests be abolished is apparently not in the
minds of those who oppose the examination system. On
the theory that like cures like, many of the proponents
of examination abolition suggest that frequent minor
oral quizzes and written tests supplant the final exam-
ination. In fact, this idea is being carried out in a. few
classes at this university, to the great relief of both
students and professors: to the former, because it re-'
lieves the strain of last-minute cramming, which so
often spoils the pleasure of a course; to the latter,
because it relieves him of the burden of preparing and
correcting lengthy blue books.

At Pennsylvania a substitute for the two weeks
preceding the final examinations includes the spending
of one week in summarizing the work of the course,
and the second week for vacation, which to our notion
is an astute idea.

Probably Io years from new college students will
be reading feature stories of the quaint customs of our
time, telling how queerly students acted the week before
the end of the semester, how they drank huge quantities
of black coffee, and how they held themselves aloof
from the world, as isolated as lepers, in training for a‘
funny little game called examinations.

THE APPLE POLISHERS
(From the Creightoninn) ,

In every school, on every campus, in every office—
in fact every place where maintaining the good will
of superiors is thought to be the only means of success
ﬁwe have what modem parlance has termed "apple
polishing.” The apple polishers are easily distinguished
from the really useful persons by their "Oh, so genteel"
conversation in the presence of those upon whom an
impression is to be made. In the schools and universities
they are more easily determined by the “good morning,
professor” salutation that is sure to issue from their
lips upon meeting any instructor from the under-grad-
uate assistant to the heads of departments After every
class they rush up to the instructor’s desk and ask the
simplest kind of questions which would make inmates
of the state institutions for the feeble-minded appear
as the nation’s thinkers. In most cases the persons ask-
ing the questions are fairly intelligent but they know
of no other way to draw a smile of approval from the
instructor's lips, Might we not suggest a good old game
of “ring around the rosie,” or "pussy in the corner” to
pilt the instructor in a more susceptible mood7

It ls a good thing for the instructors that the de-
pression has tabood.the age-old custom of bringing a
nice rod apple to the teacher and thereby raise the
grade ten points unless, of course, the apple is woriny
in which case the grade goes down ten points. If the
custom were not out. of style the present crop of apple-
polishcrs would bring so many apples to class that the
instructors would be eating much more than their apple
a day and consequently would suffer from a severe
case of "over-apple-cating."

It was ncver intended, however, that there should
bc a closed circle'between the student and the instruc-
tor. The instructor is human and the student is human
and whcn human beings get together there is a tend-
ency to eomradsllip. We are going to live with people
all our lives rcgardlcss of what we do We might just
as well licgin Lo get along with people in school but to
do it only as a means of getting a better grade is ab-
surd. There is a differenoc lictwceulhe genuine friend-
liness and the apple-polls ing type, The truly friendly
person never says, “Why he talks real fricndly to me
outside of class and then gives me a s Ly." Of course,
they will talk friendly. Instructors are not barbarians
whose only delight might be in thinking students.

The apple-polishcrs never got very for, though.
For some reason or other they fail to click either with
the instructor or fellow students. They do not carry
apples but they Stand out as prominently as the nation’s
prize boobs.
