Tennis Team Splits In Meets

The tennis team opened con*

ference play last weekend by
edging Lawrence 574 before
falling to an excellent Ripon
team 7—2. ,

The Lawrence match featur-
ed a determined comeback by
the Pioneers doubles teams
that caught the unwary Law-
rence team completely by our
prise. Trailing 4—2 after a
poor showing in the singles,
the Grinnellians swept all
three doubles matches to de~
feat the stunned Lawrence
squad. In the ﬁnal and decid-
ing match, Glenn Dishing and
Dave Beeman rallied in the
moonlight from a 5-1 deficit
to a 10-7 victory while the
spectators were unable to even
see the hall in the darlo'tess.
Against Ripon, however, the
Grinnell team didn't fare so
well, managing to win only
two singles and no doubles
matches.

her five, was the only player

to win singles in both meets,
apparently psyching his op-

and confidence both improved
greatly the past week and he
won against Lawrenceatnum-

one of his last year‘s losses
by defeating the number two
player from Ripon in the only
other Grinnell singles victory
of the weekend. Bruce Bonne-
well at number three was the
only other singles player to
come close as he dropped
three set matches to beth

Runners Take Second At Cornell

Grinnell's track team is
really striding with pride
these days as the scurriers
took second last week in the
Cornell Relays. The winner
of the traditional event was
Coe College, easily Outdisba'ir
cing Grinnell 73 1/2 , 53.
Morningside took third with
52.

The Smrlet and Black had 4
winners of some sort and
placed in 10 of the 17 events
at the meet. Individual win—
ners were Chuck McGrath in
the grueling three-mile run
and Barry Huff in the shot put
with a winning heave of 47 -
7 1/2; Definitely impgssive
for a guy who doesn‘t work
out. Chuckle's threermile run
set a new school record.

Two relay teams were also
victorious. The sprint med-
ley outdistanced the competir
tion on the swift legs of Bill
Swan, Carl Brennan, Jon Gray,
and Phil Morales. Likewise,
the distance medley sprinted
away from the competition
on the same legs of Morales
and Swan, accompanied by Bill
Schooler and Eric John.

Eric john had a moral vicn
tory as he was beaten in the
mile by an All- American from
Carlton. Chris Madsen didn‘t
bend his pole quite enoughand
took second in the pole vault
at 13‘.

A third-place was garnered
by a 480 hurdle relay of Jon
Grey, Jim Pirolli, Tom Farr,
and semi-retired Randy Sara

Baseballers CIobbered Twice

Grinnell’s baseball team
mainmined an age-old Grin-
nell tradition last Tuesday as
the Pioneers took it on their
collective chin twice, losing
both ends of a double header
to none Conference foe William
Penn by scores of 14-1 and
12-0.

It was a dry afternoon for
Grinnell as they scored in the
first inning of the first game
and then couldn't get a runner
past 2nd base for the rest of
the afternoon. Indeed, after
George Blakesley's run-pro-
ducing double in the first fr-
ame, the Pioneers could not
even produce a hit the rest of
the day.

To open (and close) Grins
nell’s case, Wes Fujil Worked
a walk, went to second on
John Videtich’s walk and rode
home on Blakesley's double.
Offense was not the onlypro-
blern Grinnell had, however.
They committed a horrendous
8 errors in the first gameand
added 6 more in the nightmp.
Actually, it’s ratheramazing
that the Pioneers didas wellas
they did; William Penn had
already played several games
While Grinnell had had only
slightly more than a week of
practice, with no hitting. All
in all, things should improve
as experience mounts.

This weekend. with the
team's ranks swollen by the
late additions ofﬁair to- middr

Jock Eric Hines, the Pioneers
tangle with Cornell here (well,
actually, at the High School's
diamond) at 2:30 Friday, then
travel to Cornell for a brace
of games Saturday. After disr
cussing the matter with my
not-so- crystal ball and with
certain members of the team,
I've reached the conclusion
that there is a chance of a
split with Coe. There is also
a chance that the ROl‘Cvpro»

by squatrbody Lewis in the
shot and Pirolli in the 440

An added attraction for next
week is the appearance of
Spear-chucker Dicks in the
javelin. This, a warning to
all gophers.

And so, another article for
the track season ends on a
bright note. Let’s hear it for
Moe!

'Softhallers Start

Softball begn its five week
stint under cold skies. Few
surprises were evident as
Haines won both of its games
behind Brownic'spitching, and
North showed its delerminar
tion to give Haines a battle
for the top. The profs, after
dropping an extrarinning bat-
tle to Cowles, scored 36 runs
in humbling a Smith team
which had braved opening day
winds to defeat Read. This
week sees the profs, with hits
ting star Greg Guroff (2 hr),
meet Off Campus and try to
revenge their loss in a pre-
season practice game.

Now that the country club
has opened, 1M Golfis under
way. This year's specialevent
is ”Nickle Beer Night" at the
Horn. The Favorite is rumorc
ed to be Off Campus, followed
closely by Langan.

Golfers Open With Two losses

Grinnell’s golf team opened
the season with a pair of 105"
ses in their first match last
Friday in Galesburg against
Knox and Monmouth. They re-
bounded Tuesday by defeating
William Penn and tying Cor-
nell for second place in a
quadrangular meet at the Grin
quadrangular meet atthe Grr
innell course. Simpson took
first place honors.

On Friday Grinnell scored
only 3 1/2 points to Knox’s
11 1/2 at the latter’s home
course. Monmouth beat Grin-
nell by ten strokes. Co-cap~
tain Skip Tredway led the way
with an 80, tying for lowmed-
alist. Bill “Okie” Chown shot
an 86.

At home Tuesday the Pion-

eers were again led by Tred-
way and Chown with identical
scores of 76. Al Schoene's
81, his best in competition,
clinched second place and a
steak dinner offered by Mr.
Dick Ullrich of the Develop-
ment Office for the team's
first win.

The Pioneers, still hurt by‘

. the absence of Tom Lincoln

who has had surgery for an
eye injury, journey on a four
day road trip this weekend.
Today they play the first round
of the UNIrWartburg Tournaa
ment in Waterloo with the se-
cond round Saturday at Wav~
erly, From there they go to
Northfield, Minnesota for a
Monday match aginst Carle-
ton, St. Olaf, and Cornell.
