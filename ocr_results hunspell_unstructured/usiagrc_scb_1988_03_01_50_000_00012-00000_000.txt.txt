If people were asked after
your time as vice-president
to describe you, what would
you like them to say?

Cathy Baldwin

I would like them to be able
to say that in my position in my
time in ofﬁce I did my utmost to
reprr-sellt the students and ad-
dress their concerns. And not
only did I address their concerns
but I got things done It’s one
thin: ‘e M‘k about “i "r- it’s
one ‘lling tr» attempt them, but
it’s ~0mething entirely dilferent
to iccomp ish things. Somer
timts it‘s Very difficult because
you only h we a year in ofﬁce.
I would lik them to be able to
say that. I did things to improve
communication on this campus,
and the way in which a student
could get information and act on
thar information in student govr
erniiieiit,

Last yerlr you ran for SGA
PmSldent, now you’re runn-
ing for vi :e-president. Why

of directinn"

the (-h?
Torn Worth '

The change of direction has
been for a couple of reasons.
Last year I was a student ad-
visor and Ali was on my floor.
I did not want to run against
Ali ﬁrst of all. Second of all,
rd been attending Joint Board
meetings. I’d been working on
the S and B and I knew a lot
about what was going on in stu-
dent government 1 was very in.
terested in student government.
I wasn‘t as familiar with aca
demic issues at that point, but I
was very familiar with the social
issues. I wanted try it. Partly
it was to just seen what it was
like. I was curious. It was not
the noblest of motives that I ran
least year. I wanted to see how
it was to organize a campaign.
I was interested in those issues
and wanted to be involved as
an SGA president. This year 1
have been much more involved
in academic issues. 1 got onto
the EPC in my department and
then student council of cirricu-
lum. Also it’s my second year on
judicial council and their have
been some major revisions in
the bylaws of judicial council.

The Many Functions
of SGA

what is SGA? What docs SGA do? Does SGA do anything?
Frequently, students at Grinnell ask questions such as these, be-
cause they are not familiar with the role that the Student Govern.
ment Association (SGA) plays on campus. Often times, students
are surprised when they learn the number of services that SGA
offers to the campus community. In an effort to make students
more aware of SGA’s role at Grinncll, the following list of SGA
duties/services has been compiled. The information may also help
students decide who they feel is most qualiﬁed to serve as president
and viceprcsident of SGA next year.

0 Selection of campus ﬁlms (Films Committee)

. Selection of campus concerts (Concerts Committee)

cial Concerns Task Force, etc.)

tional, and international topics (Student Rules and Politics Com~
mittee)

a Representation of students to:

. the Board of Trustees
. the Administration

. the Faculty

. the Alumni Board

. college committees

The majority of these services are carried out by the nine cabs
inet members and the committees of SGA. The cabinet members
hold omce hours every week. Students are encouraged to come
to the SGA ofﬁce and discuss issucs and concerns. In addition,
committees usually meet once per week. if students are interested
in ﬁnding out when a particular committee meets, they should
Contact their senator.

Students are further represented on SGA by a body called the
Joint Board. Joint Board consists of 23 senators elected from stur
dent dorms and houses. The Senators are responsible for repre-
senting student opinion to the cabinet, informing constituents of
SGA activities, approving all SGA by-laws, and approving all SGA
funding allocations. Many senators also represent Joint Board on
various college committees. Joint Board meetings are held every
Wednesday night at 7:30pm. Any Grinnell student is permitted to
attend and speak at Joint Board meetings, however only senators
may vote on the issues brought before the board.

The President and vice President are essentially the bread and
butter of the entire process Not only do both positions have a
number of duties to fulfill, but they are also responsible for ap-
pointing the cabinet members and committee chairs. The duties
of the president tend to focus around student life, while the vice.
president deals more with curricular issues.

Unfortunately, the Student Government Association is severely
crippled without student interest in the process, It is only through
student input that SGA can improve the services it offers. Ulti-
mately, the representation that SGA provides is limited to those
students who make their opinions known.

Endorsements

The Scarlet and Black editorial staii has decided to en-
dorse two candidates (or each ofﬁce. Our choices are
Pleshetle Hamh and Gre Evans for SGA President, and
Rob KI on and Cathy Ba dwin {or SGA Vice-President.

our reasons for suggesting Hamb and Evans both have
much to do with experience. Evans has had a great deal
of experience in SGA while Hamb has had extensive ex-
perience in many other campus organizations. Evans has
clearly-deﬁned, realistic goals and possesses the orientnr
tion to move towards accomplishing those oals. Hanlb
brings to the campaign a commitment to iversiry that .
distinguishes her from her opponents. Both candidates
possess quality leadership and organizational skills that ce»
nlenl them as the best candidates for president.

Experience, as well as knowled e of the office weigh
heavily in our selection of Baldwtn and Killion for vice

resident. Baldwin's service on SEPC, as chair of the

trident Building Committee and experience as a hall sen-
ator qualify her as a to -notch candidate. Killion's work as
SGA Administrative éhordinator, chair of election board
and his Ians for educating the student body on the work-
ings of gGA make him a solid choice. Adding to that both
candidates' obvious commitment to the job and knowledge
of what the job entails makes them the clear leaders In
the race.

Our decisions are based on the candidates' statements
of intent. the interviews and our own observations. These
endorsements are our opinions. Our intention is not In tell
our readers who to vote for. If it were, we have done a
very poor job of it because we have given you foltr choices
for two spots. It is in our own best interests Io read the
statements, the inlervrews. o to the 0 en forums. talk to
the candidates, and decide or yoursel . An informational
article on the workings of SGA appears elsewhere on this
page. It may provide answers to some at your questions
about how SGA functions. Use it, as well as our endorse-
ments, as supplementsrto the statements. interviews and
discussions in evaluating the candidates and making your
choice.
