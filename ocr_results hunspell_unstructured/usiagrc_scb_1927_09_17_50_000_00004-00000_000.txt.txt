1 0A feather- weight touch
is all this pen requires;

Stop Pressing'

And mm a Pen
that stays in Per/"ed Tim
or in Make Gooane‘

The new model Parker
Duofold introduces pressure-
less Writing—and stays in
perfect order.We agree your
ﬁrst most shall be your last.

No hand can distort its
point—yet itylelds to any
stylcofwriting. .

We spent 35 years on 47
major improvements. Made
sixteen million Pens. Own
32 patents on Pens and 12
on Pencils and Desk Sets.

We discovered how to
combine capillary attraction
with gravity feed. Thus a
feather-weight touch starts
ink-ﬂow; the light balanced
weight of the Pen is almost
enough to keep it writing.

Barrels are now of Parker
Permamte—Non-Breakable
—28 70 lighter than rubber
formerly used. They comein
jewelrlike colors—Jade,Lac-
quer—red, ﬂashing Black,
Mandarin Shadow and Lapis
LazuliBlue—aﬂ Mack-tipped.

People are thronging the
pen counters to sample this
pressureless writing, Only
one caution: look for the im-
print, “Geo. s. Parker-
DUOFOLD."
