scholastic ineligibility Beluit's
Ed Water, all conference 155

Coupled with Water's absence
is the probability that the
Braves will forfeit in either the
121 or 128 pound classes in ad—
dition tn the heavyweight'divr

Coach Brown will retain his

SPORTS SIDELIGHTS

My most sincere congratula-
tions are extended to “Hank”
Brown, .newly appointed head
football coach. liaving done a
swell jola last fall with the lines
men, and at present tutoring the
wrestling team, Coach Brown 'is
well known and well liked by
all with whom he has come in
contact. Loads of luck, Hank!
Well, a week from tomorrow
night is the Beloit game. Riding
on top with seven straight wins,

tonight, and then the hot and
cold Lawrence outfit invades the
Beloit home grounds a week
from tonight, Our Pioneers
move in the following’evening.
Beloit slaughtered two oppon-
ents last week as‘ Cornell fell
sit—35;, and then Lawrence was
thumped 97773. The latter game
established a new conference
record for total points scored in
a single game, and the 34 points
dunked in by Ronnie Bontemps,
Beloit’s center. is also a new
record tor individual perform.
