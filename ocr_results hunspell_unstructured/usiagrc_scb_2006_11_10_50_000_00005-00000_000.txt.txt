on any given weekend, there is at least one
swing exchange being held in America. where
swing dancers from all over converge on one
location to sample the local dancing scene.
This Friday and Saturday, for the first time,
that location will be Grinnell,

An exchange is a swing scene’s big chance
to show itselfoff, and members ofthe Grinnell
College Swing Society say they have a lot to be
proud of. “We have this
really amazing scene,”
said Jackie Graves ‘09.
“I've been to a lot of dif-
ferent places. I've been
all over Minneapolis to
dance, and I’ve been to
Chicago, and I've been
to SI, Louisl think we
have the chillest scene. We do have one of the
best communities I’ve seen,"

The Swing Soctety has existed on and off
at Grinnell for years, but its popularity sky-
rocketed three years ago under the leadership
of Justin Riley ‘06 and Eryn O'Neil ‘07. The
group’s weekly dance lessons have an atten-
dance that varies from 30 to 80, and 300 stu-
dents are on the mailing list. “I think we’re rc-
ally unique in that we have a gargantuan swing
scene at a college in the middle of nowhere,"
said Matt Schnrros, “VVe’re tiny, right, and yet
we have swing clubs that rival ISU U ofI,"

The Grinnell Cole
legc swing Exchange
will consist of five events.
This evening there will be
a Harris party, including
a competition, followed
by an aftcrrparty at “The
Porn" offzcampus house on Broad Street. On
Saturday, a dinner and dance at the Rosenfield
Center will be followed by a blues concert and
finally a late»night “dance ‘til you drop” event
at German Hans. The Harris party and blues
concert are open to all. The rest of the events
require the $20 registration fee for the ex-
change, 510 for Grinnell students.

Forty dancers from out otrown have regis‘

tcred for the exchange, including people from
loWa, Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska
and even Colorado and Pennsylvania. Most
are students from colleges like Macalestei,
Caileton, Iowa State, University of lowa, Uni-
versity of Wisconsin at Madison and others
Bur non-students are also represented: 35 per-
ccnt ofnrtendees did not report being afﬁliated
with a college, and several are in their 20s and
305,

The Swing Society
has brought in outside
music for their prcvir
ous Hams parties, but
for the exchange, Ben
Cohn '08 put together
a band specifically for
the cvenr. Made up of
Grinnell musicians and
approaching the traditional Big Band size of
20 members, The Big Bad soulrans of swing
will perform at Harris on Friday

SGA Concerts committee had planned
Saturday's concert by Chicago band Lil’ Ed
and the Blues Imperials independently ofrhe
exchange, but they welcomed the exchange
organizers publicizing it as part of the swing
weekend.

Typically, swing exchanges are planned
about a year in advance. In Grinnell’s case,
however, co—organizers O'Neil and Julia Bot—
rlcs ‘08 have only been planning since early

seprcmbcr. The idea
had come up in previ-
ous semesters but had
never seemed viable
until now,

Despite the tight
deadline, O'Neil
said that the preparation went surprisingly
smoothly. “It was pretty incredible the way this
just fell together," she said. “There’s no way we
could do it without so many who stepped up
to help. "

Benjamin Herring ’09 summed up the
Swing Society’s high hopes for rhe exchange:
“I am looking forward to dancing so much thar
I can’t walk come Monday "

Saturday, Nov. 11 l,
9:00 pm.

Ifyou’ve never seen a rocking blues band. you’re in for a sur»
prise. When a band like Lit Ed and the Blues Imperials comes
to town, there’s only one word to describe it: wild.

At the show, don’t be fooled by Lil' Ed's tiny appearance—
on stage, his powerful blues drawl and dancing slidc gniirar
make him larger than life. joining the force that is the blues
are bassist “Pookie,” rhythm guitarist Mike and drummer Kelly.
Their shows are known to pack the house and rilc up the nu
dience with a rocking bear and scratchy vocals for a heck ofa
good time.

The band Is native to the west side of Chicago, where Lil'
Ed was born and raised. As the nephew otlegendary blues gui-
tarist,J.B. Hutto, Lil’ Ed claims that the music is in his blood.
From a young age, Ed and halfrbrothcr Pookic rook lessons
from their uncle while working odd jobs from buffering cars

to driving school buses They got rheir big break after a rcr
cord company heard their music and invited them re the studio.
They had never performed in a studio, so rhcy did what came
naturally: jamming, It was apparenrly impressive, sincc rhey
were signed that very day. There was no looking back for Lil’
Ed and the boys. They’ve been packing small joints ever since.
The band’s public recognition has included ii review from
rhc Boston Globe referring to them as “the world's #1 houscr
rocking band.” They have even made a guest appearance on
Conan O'Brian whcrc Lil’ Ed humorously tried his hand at

teaching Conan rhe blues.

Concert review: folk legend Baez serenades Herrick

“I am aware that I’m a walking history lesson," remarked
Joan Baez as she took the stage Monday night in Herrick Char
pel. Baez was met with a packed house poised to receive exV
ncrly that: a history lesson in folk music. Fioin the 1923 Cartci
family hit “\Nildwood Flower,” to Leonard Cohen’s “Suzanne,“
to Baez's own most rccenr composirion “coconurs,” Monday
night’s set list was as chronologically diverse as Baez’s own ca-
reer.

Baez wasted no time opening with a crowd favorite, “The
NightThey Drove Old Dixie Downi"She maintained momen-
tum throughout the evening with simple but lush tworrorrhreer
guitar arrangements, incorporating an array of guitars manned
by Graham Maby (former bassist of the band They Might Be
Giants) and Eric de la Pena.

True to form, Baez did not neglect her tradition of politir
cal and social activism. She channeled the crowd’s energy with
singzalong versions of “Itumbaya” and “Amazing Giacc," and
performed the politicized “Joe Hill.”

As Baez slowly held her hands above her head, singing
come back, Martin Luther King," on “Christmas in VVashing-

ton,"the room took on the charged atmosphere ofa 1960: pro-
test maich. While most listeners are familiar with this hack
neyed scene, Baez kept one step ahead.

She frequently poked fun at borh her and Bob Dylan's
folk music legacies. As a iunning gag, Baez referred to Dylan
as “His Lordship,” before paying homage with a few Dylan
runes. Midway through “Love Is just a Four Lcrtci Word” she
switched to a raspy, rwanging Dylan impersonation.

She sent the crowd rolling with laughter during “Coctr
nuts," a playful tune that was made even goofier by her anec-
dote about playing the song at a gay pride march.

Baez readily dinilged anecdotes, including some about hci
infamous earflame, Dylan, Before performing “Love Is Just
a Four Letter Word," Baez explained how she had watched
Dylan “wasting away" as he wrote the song at her house “Aren't
you glad 1 fed him?"t]uipped Baez at the end of the song.

Baez's loi‘ig‘lerintcheek style only emphasized the facc that
she has eained the right to make fun. “I was never about the
money," Baez explained ro rhe crowd. “I was always about the
adulation, and you're doing just fine."

The adulation she received was indeed deserved. Over the
course ofhei fivezdecade career, licr Voice has acquired a darkei,
huskiei' quality than that ofrhe Isryearrold who burgeoncd on
rhe srage oftlie1959 Newpoit Folk Festival Nonetheless, Baez
has lost norhing other ﬂuttering vibmto, effortless vocal range
and subtle, emotive phiasing.

Similarly, Baez's formidable stage presence reinforced hcr
commanding, somcrimes sassy style. on a few numbers, she
abandoned her guitar, ﬂung her hands high into the air, and
struck a dynamic, matador-like pose.

No performance is without its flaws. At the outset of“Caleb
Meyer,“De la Pena began to play his mandolin in the wrong key
and In the middle of her signature tune “Diamonds and Rust,"
Baez paused briefly to right a slipzup she had made.“This is all
part of what makes it authentic," Baez quipped.

Indeed, if Baez taught us anything about folk music on
Monday night, as that the heart ofits effectiveness to inspire
change is rhe aiirhcnriciry, vivactty and unpredictability oflive
performance and at this, Baez is a master.
