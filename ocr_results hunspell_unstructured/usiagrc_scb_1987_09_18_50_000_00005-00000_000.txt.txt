semester, SHH will be working
on renovating the shelters and
doing srrch miscellaneous tasks
as paint removal, cooking, and

This year, SHH also will
be working with the Catholic

which operates a freeefoocl store
on its grounds. The contrir

words “Safe House." Crowded
with furniture and belongings,
but still comfortable, the Shelter
is home to several families who,
due to assorted reasons, are now
homeless.

Wendy, a resident volrrnteer,
stated that there is a policy of
“no questions asked" when peo—
ple call requesting shelter “Vile

possibly can. sometimes that
means having pcople on floors

on the philosophy of 1930s ac.
tivist Dorothy Day, the shelter
charges no fees and, according
to Wendy, should be viewed “as
a private lrorue with guests. We
get no government funds."

Wendy said that the demand
for shelter varies seasonally, “In

or rent 50' they have to leave. In

Eating disorders

a statf Registered Nurse at the
Health Center believes “we have'
reached a plateau" in the rise of
eating disorders. In any case, for
a person who believes that he or
she may have a problem, admite
lance to a treatment program
rrrrrst be voluntary. As resident
adviser Beth Frumkin prrts it,
the treatment programs “don't
just jump in and try to change
somebody’s life.”

Treatment involves a. combir
nation of personal counseling,
family therapy, and diet renova-
tion. Although Fraser and Hair
ley do some counseling them-
selves, and there is a cam»
pus dietitian who helps stu-
dents with nutritional and diet
needs, most students are re-
{erred to the Mental Health
Center. The Center offers out»
patient services only and severe
cases are referred to an inpae
tient facility. At Grinnell’s Merl-
tztl Health Center, the coun—
selors try to educate their pa-
tients about nutrition, body im-
age, stress management, and
other coping strategies. “I think
it's not education about the’eate
irrg disorder that is so inrpor
tant," says Bard, “[but] it’s ecle
rrcatiort about the other things.‘

She adds that “people with
eating disorders need a lot of
support. They need to break
the cycle of depression." “Eatr
irrg disorders are not shortrterul
illnesses,“ stresses Bailey, rtnds
thus recovery can be extremely
lengthy. Bard also commented
that because the eating patterns
of the afﬂicted individuals are a
coping mechanism for them, it is
easy tor even recovered patients
to revert to those patterns under

ever, that he wanted to return
to outdoor recreation programs
because they ”offer a good re—
lease, develop lifelong interests,

and are a quality learning exper
rience.“

Zeiss chose Grinnell because
he was familiar with its outdoor
recreation philosophy and be-
cause of its small size. He likes
being involved, but said that be-
cause of Grinnell’s diversity, he
must be adaptable. He wants
‘3 see two things happen in the
future of GORP: the sponsor
ing of more beginner sessions
and nonrtechnical activities such
as movies and folk sings; and
the expansion into trips, such
as sea kayaking or canoe trips
to Canada, for moreadvanoed
members.

zeiss believes that these two
areas complement each other,
because it is the rnoreadvancecl
students who go on to be the
leaders of the other, trips. He
thinks it is important to have
both levels represented in the
program. Zeiss believes that
GORP “is a program which has
