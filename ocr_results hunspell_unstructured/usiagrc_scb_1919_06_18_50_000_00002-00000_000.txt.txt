An article appearing in the What Do
Yuu'Think column gives Protessor
H. s, Collard's news in iegard to'the
hazing of individuals among the upper
classiuen ivhich occurred last Friday
night. '

We would say, first of all, to Pro-
fessor Conai-d, that in our capacity as
jokees we enjoyed the whole attair to
the limit. The stunts were well s ,
lected and staged and we hereby ex-
press our thanhs tor a royal good time
to those who were responsible.

put there are certain principles in—
volved which force us to place the
matter in a somewhat more serious
light. ‘

In i-egard'to the speciﬁc point of a
class scrap and its origin it is illum-
inating to note that according to a
“Grad" whose communication also ap-
pears in this issue the Seniors tank
a hand in the ﬁght, not to promote it,
but to keep it from being a butchering
contest.

But the really fundamental issue in-
volved, to our mind, is whether or not
the upperclassmen, by virtue of a lon-
ger college experience involving a bet—
ter understanding of college life in
general and Grinnell standards in par-
ticular, do not have a certain responsi<
bility that undercl siiicn do not have,

Does the npperclassman have a duty
to perform in helping and directing his
younger and less experienced college
brother or does freshman, sophomore.
junior and senior stand on precisely
the same plane in student life?

It seems to us that the question has
been answered by the iceulty them.
selves
on matters which come betore the fac-
ulty the instructors are not allowed to
vote. ‘Thc' two cases stem exactly
analogous.

One should consider this matter
well before condemning a tradition
which has heen ii! ucli long and mile

ently based on a sound idea.

to us how they were going to run
Grinnelly. By their sophomore year
most or them had learned at least
seine sense and were ready, otten too
ready, to indicate to the newcomers at
their second year the golden road to
success. By the time they really be-
came prominent in worthy student ac-
tivities in their 'Junior and Senior
years they became respected and help-
ed continue the students traditions,
no‘t‘of one but of many generations.

How does it happen that Sophs of
all men join or invite a bunch of
Freshman, who might be assumed to
know no better, to attack lead‘ s in
the upper classes, even in a spirit or
fun. This points to bad morale. It
suggests that even the upperclassmeu
have not been united in their support
or the best interests of the college.

I should like to put this question to
the Sophs, who will he Juniors next
year, and to the Freshmen, who will
be Soplls: Do you or do you not accept
at least some responsibility for forma
ing student opimon? If you accept
such responsibility then you this
'spring have been most guilty of start-
ing to break down the very tradition
‘oi' which we Alumni are most proud.

Class scrap or no class scrap—that
is of minor importance. In its origin
‘at least the custom of Senior over—
sight of the scrap was well-meant—r
and indeed needed. More than once
knives had to be talren away from too
eager partisans, But let we repeat:
No linilqi'classman can afford to break
down a tradition which he himself will

ing college life since 1392 iii a number
of institutions I feel free in saying
that all Freshman-Sophomore scraps
are carried on under instructions from'
‘tllc upper classmen. The lower class-
men never have any real grievance

You are also to be congratulated as
a ﬁrst-rate modern journalist. You
suppressed the ne\Vs,7tbe facts or the
ease, championed the cause of your

own group, and hcrcely denounced
those unruly underlings who retused
to go into the coclipit for you, but
were all too willing to go in WITH
you. We all know why you tool: this
position. Couldn't you laugh at a
joke when you were the jokee?

In iact, that escapade was the best
bit of college discipline I have ever
known. We hope it will be repeated.
But we hope it will not again he need-

The real question is, “15 S. at B. the

the people’s press, or the Capitalists’
Press? What is a newspaper?
