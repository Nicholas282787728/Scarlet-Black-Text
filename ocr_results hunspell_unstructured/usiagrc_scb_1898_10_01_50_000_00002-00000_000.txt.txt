asr week has ,een a few
new tlevclopnlents in the matter
or a men's gymnasium Thursday
at the trustees meeting it was de-
cided that enough money had
been raised [or the erection of the
building proper, and it $3,000
could be obtained [or the lill'iiishr
ing of it work on it would be calm
menccd at oncc. so tar only a
few of the students have conti'ibr
lited toward the building uncl it
seems only right that those who
have the most. interest ill it should
help to some degree, Twelve
hundred dollars hits been raised
among the students and ii pledges
averaging but ﬁve dollars coultl
be obtained from Ztll who have not
pledged we would probably be
able to see work commenced on
the building within three weeks

Dunn's THE coming wccl: the
October number of flu- Unzt will
probably make its appearance,
and will. in rcspcct to neatness
and general torrn, be iar snperior
to any past issue. The most con-
spicuous change, and onc which is
to be heartily commended. will
appear in the shape of a new covet
design. The cover this year will
hear an entirely new rlesign which
has been drawn by a member oi
the stall of editors, and it is the
intention to vary' this with othel
designs if students can be [aunt]
who will furnish them. Here is a
ﬁeld open to any one who has any
ability in drallghtsmanship, and it
it is sincerely hoped that several
designs can be obtained, T/ll Unit
will have a special style of type
this year, which with the addition
olinitial letters and other specials
ties in typography, will give the
magazine a much more attractive
appearance. Fault has sometimes
been found With the contents of
the magazine, but every student
should remember that he is in
sonic degree responsible for this.

Y‘Iic Unit depends upon the stu-
dents [or contributions to its colr
uinus and as long as the ctlitors
have but a sninll quantity of ma
terial to choose from just so long
it will happen that some issues
are deﬁcient in literary merits.
77w Um! is run at a ﬁnancial loss
and is kept up simply because oi
the (act that there is a grcat need
among the students for a literaiy
magazme of its nature. If the
students continue to feel, as some
have in the past that they do not
care torthe experience which is
to be gained from writing for Th:
Utii't, it cannot be expected that
the literary meiit ot the magazrne
will be of a high standard. The
Unit as yetis young and when
we consider this fact we can-
not but leel that it has accomr
plished something. The manner,
however. which the students
take hold of it this year ivillin

great part determine whether it
shall live or whether it shall be
dropped. It is a magazme edited
tor and bythe students and all
should cooperate in making it a
success.

These classes are open to all, and

We cravc pardon, but we wish
to have a word with the one who
was in charge of kiildly taking

services at the General College
Reception. We will be pleased
to exchange our new one on very
reasonable terms for it although
