Pani'omime Produciion of 'Agamemnon'

Proves' Eni'erfaining +0 First Audience
by Bruce Cole

Bill Ingram’s staging and directing of Aeschylus' “Againemnon”
was a courageous and ambitious effort, if not an altogether spell-
binding one. The combination of pantomine and previously tape—
recorded dialogue was quite effective once the initial curiousness
wore off. A thorough familiarity with the script would have add-
ed inuneasurably to this reviewers appreciation of the performance
since many of the lines were barely untelligible.

Queen Clytemnestra were skill~

the fact that they, alone of the

concede that he employed the
resources which were available
to him with remarkable indus-

That which was missing
from ”Agamemnon” was more
the iault of Aeschylus than
lngram. Perhaps the lault
might better be placed with
the audience or even the mod»
ern mind. There was a strong
temptation, atter the final
curtain had risen and the
lights had come on, to ask
what it was all about.
”Agamemnon" is a story with
little plot and less humor. The
gram and his cast oi Grinnellr
ians probably gave it as much
life as the script allowed. They
all deserve our appreciation for
a serious and effective sixty
minutes of diversion and en—
tertainment.
