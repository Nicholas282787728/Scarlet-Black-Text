same levelas Macalester but wedidn’t
follow it for the ivhole 90 minutes."
The contest remained scoreless until

Sports in our society: Women’s
perspectives on participation

The issue of gender equity is one
which is fraught with controversy
and generates much discussion with
in academic circles.

As it legally instires equaloppor-
tunity incollege level sports,TitleIX
offers both women and men a chance
to play aihletics. However, because
Title IX also insures that the ratio of
female and male students must equal
theratio offemale and male athletes,
several problems arise.

One of these is linked to the
sport of football, which requires an
overly large number of players. The
large size of football teams at most
colleges offsets the ratio offemale to
maleathletesandthencausesascram—
ble—usiially in terms of budgetary
allotmcnt$7to be officially equita»
ble. Burfoothallbtings in moneyand
support to most schools, especially
big name universities, and to even
think of questioning whether a
school’s football teamshould be fund—
ed is pretty unthinkable.

Then there is the much deeper
problem of the lack offemale partio
ipation is athletics Many critics of
Title IX use this as an example urtbe
law’s detachment from “real life.”
The argument basically runs that it’s
useless to pour money into progmms
which provide equal opportunity in
athletics when women aren’t even
playing sports in the same numbers
that men are. Let’s face it, they say,
women aren’t even playing sports:
Title IX doesn’t work.

In hard numbers, this is true.
Here at Grinnell, where we have a
female—male student ratio of 52%»
48%, we have a femalEemale athlete
ratio of 27%r29%. The fact that
women and men have the same op—
portunities to play in college level

“We beat One in one of the
worst games I‘ve seen and then lost
to Macalaster in one ofthe bestgames
I’ve seen," stated the Orinnell Col<
legemen'ssoccercoachlohnFfitsch.
The Pioneers (2—1, LO) defeated
Midwest Conference opponeanoe,
1—0, and then fell to nolrleﬂglle foe
MacalasteronSaturday, Z»l. Against
Coe, Chad Stewart scored the lone
goal en route to Ihe narrow victory.
“We underestimated Coe and they
look advantage of it," said Coach
Pfitsch. “I’m glad we got a confer—
encc win, but It was not pretty."

Macalestet is one of top teams
in the Minnesota Conference. of
fensively, Grinnell executed plays
well but was stiﬂed by a tough Mata.
[aster defense. Junior Ryan McGary
punched in a last/minute goal to
keep the score close, but it was not
enough. Despite the defeat, Coach
Fl'itsch was pleased with his squad’s
performance.

“Macalaster was a very tough
test for this team," he said. “We
stepped irp and accepted the chal—
lenge." Coach Pfitscli singled out
freshmen Darren Bass, Dustin Goot
and Brian Vinccntc for their top«
notch defensive efforts. In addition
he praised the defensive prowess of

junior Barrett Thomas and sophor
Inote Zachary Goldman. By holding
Macalaster to only two goals, the
defensekept the Pioneers in thegame.

This week the Pioneers face three
road games. On Wednesday they
face Monmouth, one of the top squads
in the conference. “I expect a tough
game againstMonmouth,”commentr
ed Coach l’fitsch. “Their scores and
reputation suggest that they are one
of the better teams this year." This
weekend Grinnell takes on Knox on
Saturday and then travels to Flat-
[c\'lllc, WI, on Sunday. The Pior
neers hope to notch Victories by in»
creasing their offensive production
while continuing theirstrongdefen—
sive performances

sports doesn’t mean that there are an
equal number of women and men
actually playing. The critics of Title
IX are correct when they say that it
isn't bringing in droves of women to
play sports. But why is it that women
aren’t playing sports to the same de—
gree that men are? The question at
hand still remains.

The roots of sexism in our society
run deep, and theyhit little girls hard.
It would seem that athletics would, as
the rccentNikecomrnercialspurport,
give young women the tools to fight
itia sense of confidence and both
physical and emotional agility. But
the choice to play athlellm is often
one which is almost as difficult as
actually playing.

Marta Fisher, a member of the
women’s Ctossmounlty and track
teams here at Grinnell. said that she
felt she was not a Very coordinated
child. “in second gmde, i played on a
med soccer team," she says. “I was
notvery talented,orcoordinated,and
because the coach wanted only to
win, he stuck me in positions where I
didn't have to do much. I got bored
real quick.“ She stopped playing.
Although her parents didn’t actively
discourage her from being an athlete
(“they thought I spent too much time
reading,” Fisher says) she didn’t start
participating in sports again until she
was in eighth grade.

Similarly,Tashanhnson,amem—
her of the women’s basketball team,

didn’t play sports until she got to’

Grinnell. “1 was never confident in
my abiliryro play. I was always intimr
idated," she says. ]ohnson new con:
siders herself an athlete. but in high
school was just "too scared to go out
for the team."

Playing sports involves competir
tion, which is something generally
encouraged in young boys. For young
girls, however, being aggressive is ofe
ten seen as unacceptable behavior.
Fisher says that when she first began
running, she wee "horrible." “I always
came in dead last,” she says, “and
then one race I actually passed some’
one, and suddenly it got fun." Fisher
also commented on the fact that she
sees many women who don’t seem to
“knowhow to compete." “They don't
want to go too far beyond their ‘come
fort zone,” she says.

Once involved in sports, usually
at the encouragement of parents and
coaches, many girls find that some
thing is lacking. Lindsay McBride, a
member last year of the women’s soc—
cer team, noted a distinct difference
between the playing styles ofthe boys
and girls soccer teams in her home—
town. “The boys teams were always
better," she says. “The girls were
taught how to kick the ball as far as
they coiild,and torun. The boys were
taught how to dribble and how to
fake. Basically. they were taught how
to compete. The playing styles were
very different." Havmg started play—

ing In third grade, “bymiddleschool "
McBridesays, l‘the levels of play were
totally incompatible. Whenever we’d
scrimmage with the boys teams, we
knew we’d get beaten.” She adds
that “in high school, the girl’s varsity
team would scrimmage with the boy’s
junior varsity team.”

Likewise,)ulia Schlarn, a mem-
ber of the ctoss<country team, to
counted a similar story. During her
freshman year in high school, “the
coach of my lacrosse team told us
that if we were guys, he’d make us
run. He didn’t think we could be
aggressive."

Both Fisher and Iohnson credit
Grinnell for providing them with
positive and unique athletic experi—
ences, and Fisher, McBride, and
Schlam allspoke highly of thecoach—
as who encouraged mem. For the
most part, their experiences were
positive. “Running has given me a
lot of confidence,” says Fisher, who
recently participated in the Danskiri
Women’s Triathalon series in Seat—
tle, the largest multi’spott women‘s
event in the world with 1,200 partic»
ipants. But she noted that “parenu,
teachers, and coaches affect you the
most. Havingagood, orbad, one can
make all the difference in the world.”

For Molly Campé, the experi«
ence with a ”bad" coach has meant
that she ”doesn’t even want to pick
up a basketball anymore ' Acaptain

' of her high school basketball team,

and also its spokeswoman, Cat-ripe
suffered at the hands of a clearly
abusive coach. “l’ d bring team com—
plaints to him, as well as my personal
ones, and one day he asked me, ‘Do
you notice that every time you eon.
from me, you don’t get as much playr
ingtimershesays. “Hescrearned at
me. in the gym once: ‘You are not a
multi—talentedgirl, Molly.’ I screamed
back at him, ‘You can’t say that to
me! ,' and l saUt on the bench for the
next game.“ Campe adds that she
“practiced even more, trying toprove
to him that l was talented, but it
didn’t matter." She adds that thé
coach would often “tell me I would
be asmrter, and thenjust keep me on
die bench.” “i haven’t played since
high school," she says, “the experi—
ence really affected my confidence.”

Clearly, to be a female athlete
means to overcome many obstacle of
sexism. The women who play col—
lege athletics tend to be lifelong ath—
letes who were encouraged along the
way, and who have also struggled to
succeed The women interviewed
for this article represent a tiny port
tion of the women in this country
who are athletesiand most women
are not. To discuss gender equity
Without first looking at the intrinsic
element of sexism not only in sports,
but in our society, means to be blind«
ly fixing a symptom of the problem.
Theroot still exists, and its inﬂuence
runs deep.
