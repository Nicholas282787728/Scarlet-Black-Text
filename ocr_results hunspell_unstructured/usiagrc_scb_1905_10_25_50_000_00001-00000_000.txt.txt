COACH BERGEN STAYS.

The Princeton Coach will Remain unril
Friday‘EHn’lp Appears in Uniform
Again.

Through the inﬂuence or the Des
Moines alumni Con‘eh Bergen was in-
(luCed LO remain with the team until
Friday or this week. It was hoped
that he might remain until the Iowa
game, hilt he announces that it is ab-
solutely impossible. and so will go on
Friday He is using the time this
week in coaching individual players,
and in perfecting the plays which he
iiastaughtthe teamr Everyone came
through the game without serious in-
jury and were ready for practice on
Monday.

Bump reported for practice again
Monday, although he is not in ﬁrst-
clas's physical condition. In connec-
tion with the retirement of ML Bump
last week we believe that the editor
has been unjustly criticized for the
statements which appeared in Satur-
day's issue. We stated the case as the
facts were told to us, and quoted
our authorities. We did not wish to

injure Mr. Bump or to make any state-
rooms which would reﬂect on his act-
ions. 1r Mrr Bump can demonstrate
to us that we exaggerated the matter,
or that We made any statemenm which
were not correct, we will gladly
apologize to him, both publicly and
privately.

Tile two teams surged bank and

simultaneous uproar from the Grin-

warriors of the gridiron left. the ﬁeld
only after they had proven that they
had at least had “a. look in."

Every Grinnell man worked as a cog
in the wheel and deserves credit for
playing the best football he knew hOW
to play. The fact. that “Where there
is union there is strength" was fully
demonstrated. Notamau on either
team can be accused of quiting fora
single moment, but on the contrary
displayed a spirit of “get into the
game” that was most gratirylng to
watch.

\Vhen the news that we had won

no bounds. and immediately prepara-

large number of boxes were hauled to
the depot for a. bonﬁre, and when the
