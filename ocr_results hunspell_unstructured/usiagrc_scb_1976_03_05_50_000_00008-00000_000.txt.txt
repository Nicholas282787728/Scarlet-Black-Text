Sports here are for
fun, not proﬁt

by Toni Arciibcl'g
At iirst glance, there seems to be

nothing about Grinnell College
basketball that would interest the
sports world. The Pioneers are not
ranked number one in anything,
and theydo not send anybody to the
NBA And they do not have a losing
streak long enough to warrant a
human interest story. But really,
there is something worth telling
about, and that was brought to
public attention last week by an
articleabout Grinnell basketball in
The Sporting News.

Ray Warner, who is copy editor
of The New York Times and whose
sons Carl and Roger play for the
Pioneers, wrote a lengthy “slice or
life“ article about the Grinnell

Take two

team. It appeared in the March a
issue oi the magazine, one oi the
top sports Weeklies in the country,
and is entitled “Grinnell
BasketballiNot UCLA, But It’s
Fun.” The heading sums up the
main idea of the article.

Using Grinnell as an example,
Warner shows that not all colleges
have sports programs pervaded by
professionalism and luxury. The
article is an interesting, enjoyable.
vivid account oflow budgeting and,
often, losing. But Warner shows
that the Pioneer players do not
mind it that much, that enjoyment
of basketball tops their list of
priorities. And it is this attitude
that is worth knowing about.

Uniprtunately, much at the
public does not know about it.
There have not been enough ar-
ticles like Warner's to bring it to
their attention. Studies have
suggested that because of ex-
tensive media coverage on crime

and violence, many people believe
their environment is less safe than
it really is. Most likely, the same
applies to sports. With seemingly
endless coverage on recruiting
violations, coaching changes
because of poor records, and so on,
much of the public probably
believes that no one plays ior run
anymore. Articles like Warner’s
help to remind the public that that
is not universally true.

The article also provides
widespread exposure for Grinnell.
The Sporting News reaches more
nooks of this country in one week
than the admissions counselors of
any college reach in a year.
Director of Athletics John Pfitsch
said he thought “high school jocks
and their families will not have a
good reaction (to the article), but
students who are serious
academically will have a good
reaction." He added that he
thought the article neglected
slightly the “educational aspects”
of Grinnell basketball, Cager Head
Coach Ron Mitchell said he thought
the article did not portray the pride
the players have. In general, the
iaculty and administrators at the
PEG reacted favorably to the
writeup.

But regardless of how the article
affects thc image of not only the
Grinnell basketball team, but of
the entire athletics program, it is
reireshing to read about players
with this type of attitudeian at»
titude that, for the most part,
pervades all Grinnell sports. More
Ray Warners are needed to write
about more athletic programs like
Grinnell‘s to show that the attitude
oi the Pioneer basketball players is
the rule rather than the exception.
The scary thing is that it really
may be the exception. '

The Scarlet Ind Bllck, March 5. 1976—1). 8 _

Netters end with style-

by Tom Arenberg

The Grinnell varsity basketball
team beat the Cornell Rams, 81-69,
in what was probably the biggest
upset in the Midwest Conference
this year. and then held close to the
top-rated Cue Kohawks before
faltering, wool, in a season-ending
home stand last weekend,

The Pioneers finished in seventh
place in the league with a bio
record, the same mark as last
year. one game behind the sixth-
place Beloit Buccaneers. Overall.
Grinnell wound up 6-14.

Haigh wins it!

In the two games, senior iorward
John Haigh poured in 50 points to
easily win the conference scoring
title. Haigh averaged 22.5 points
per game this season. His closest
challenger, Knox’s Dave Wood»
ward, averaged 21.3.

Haigh was not the only Pioneer
to play well last week. Almost the
entire team did, especially against
Cornell on Friday night Grinnell
Head Coach Ron Mitchell said he
thought that if his Squad had
played as well all season as it had
against Cornell and C09,. it would
have been in contention for second
place, which Cornell eventually
clinched with an 115 record.
Mitchell added, “It’s too bad we
had to wait until thelast two games
to find out how good we are.”

Grinnell entered the Cornell
game with a 5-9 mark and in
seventh place. The Rams Were 1074
and within one game oi clinching
second place. The Pioneer win
itself was somewhat surprising,
but. even more amazing was the

ease with which Grinnell gained
the victory.

During a four-minute stretch
about midway into the first half,
Grinnell outscored Cornell 16-1 to
open up a lzspoint lead, The
Pioneers held the advantage for
the rest of the game, with the
Rams coming no closer than three
points.

The contest ended with a slight
scuffle when a ham player in-
tentionally fouled Pioneer Paul
Delaney more aggressively than
Delaney thought necessary. Alter
a small shoving match between
several players, the game was
terminated with two Seconds left
on the Clock.

Although the Pioneer offense
worked well, it was probably a
combination of tough Grinnell
defense and poor Cornell shooting

that decided the game. The Rams -

shot only 34 per cent from the
fieldvzs per cent in the first hali—
and their 69 point total was 12.6
below their average.

For Grinnell. Haigh scored 30
points, Carl Warner had 16 and
Delaney added 15. Senior Craig
Zippe, whom Mitchell called a
“quarterback,” also played well.

Saturday night against top-rated
Coe (now 22-0), the Pioneers, at the
most, were trying for the biggest
upset in the NCAA Division in this
year, and, atthe least, were hoping
iora respectable showing on which
to end the careers oi three seniors

As it turned out, Coe jumped to a
135 margin and Grinnell never
grabbed back the lead, although
the game was tied with 7:28 left in
the iirsthall, Even with one minute

Captain John Haigh was at the top oi his game against both Coe and
Cornell in the iinal two Grinnell basketball contests oi the season this

pcrrorinances, a very fitting end to an auspicious career.

Drift home first?

This weekend is the big one, the
Midwest Conference swimming
championships in Appleton, Wisc.
Though picked ior second place,
Grinnell has a very good chance to
dethrone Knox as champion. “l
don’texpect our men to win a lot oi
individual titles. But I think we
have the potential to pick upa lot oi
points in a lot of events," said
coach Ray Obermiller.

One competitor picked to win his
specialty is freshman diver Norm
Zimmerman, the favorite in the
required and optionals diving
events. Butterilyerdistance
swimmer John Chambers should
place high in his events as should
lreestyler-backstroker Bruce
Jones. Others expected to finish
high in their specialties include
breastroker Greg Olson and but
terl‘lyer-freestyler Bert Simpson.

Knox returns multiple winners
irom last year’s meet, [reestyler
Steve Varick and butterflyer Mike
Muro. Carleton, Cornell, and Ripon
are tabbed for the remaining first
division places, Grinnell dropped a
60-52 dual meet to Knox this season
but has beaten the other three
schools.

The key to the meet may be the
relays, in which scoring is double
that of individual evens. Chams
bers and Olson swam on the 400
yard medley ioursome which set a
conierence record last year. The
800 free relay will be swum today,
the 400 free and medley relays,
tomorrow.

While not planning any
celebration in advance, Obermiller
did state optimism as the team left
yesterday for the long and, one
hopes, rewarding drive to
Wisconsin. ’

gone in the second half, the
Pioneers trailed by only three. But
Coe’s superior secondshalf
rebounding stretched the lead to
double figures for the rest of the
contest.

“They just wore us downf
Mitchell said. Overall, Coe held a
decisive 42730 rebounding edge.
Mitchell said eight short field goal
attempts that Grinnell m .
were costly.

Warner was the only Pioneer
besides Haigh to score in double
figures. The junior guard’s
weekend output earned him ttc
19th spot in conference scoring, He
has an 11.6 average. Haigh tired in
30 points against the Kohawks,

Aiterwards, Haigh sat by his
locker, knowing he had finished
his career and knowing he had won
the scoring title. But he did not
seem to have many strong ieelings.
“I just wish we could have won,“
he said. Was that all he w
feeling? “Well, rm enjoying a
beer," he added,

The Junior VarSlty’s losing
streak stretched to five games as
an older Kirby oi Cedar Rap
team beat Grinnell, 96788, Saturday
night in Darby Gym The JV’sfinal
record is 3-7.

The Kirby players were also
bigger than the Pioneers, but li-
Scarlet and Black was able to stick
close until very late in the game
Thelead irequently changed hands
in the contest, but when Kirby
pulled away in the latter minutes,
the JV was unable to catch up since
it had to play with four men on the
court for the last 90 seconds, due to
foul trouble.

The Grinnell Pioneer wrcstiﬁ
team finished its season at Coc this
past weekend in the Midwcst
Conference Meet. The Pioneer!
entered the tourney with three l
their nine grapplers hampered
injuries. Coach Mo Hunt com-
lnenled on the Pioneer per-
formance, “I was very pleased, but
we didn’t finish as well as I thought
we would ” Most of lhe matches
were very close and Grinnell
finished with 17Vz team points. only
lilo points less than the third place
team‘s score.

Four Pioneer matmen finished
fourth. Freshmen David Green»

(1347 showed poise in their iirst
Midwest Conference meet. Stacey
lost his fourth match by only *‘*
score of 0-2. Greenwald had
unfortunate loss in his iirst match,
but he put on steam in his later
matches.

Rick Grayson (152) was the
highlight oi the Grinnell teanv
Grayson wrestled well for all of his
matches and his loss to the number
one seed was debatable. Hunt felt
that the referee missed Grayson’s
pin in the early part of the match.
Aiter the scare, Grayson’s op-
ponent persevered, 373.

Captain Hosea Engram (167),
suffering from some injured ri‘
also took a fourth place, In his
match mm the number one seed

problem by jamming his right
arm. He stayed in competition a

Hunt was pleased with this
year's team, He remarked, “It is
the best team that l have had in all‘
my years at Grinnell. The kids had
a great attitude and were a
pleasure to coach. lcan only
look iorward to next year becausg.
we only lose one wrestler, Dan
Mosby (177), and four men finished
with winning seasons. ”
