Crisis of Chinese Japanese War Will

Come During Next Summer-—Latlimore

"The great Crisis of the Chinese-
Japanese war will come sometime
in July or June of the summer of
1939,” Owen D. Lattimore stated
In his fourth of eight lectures on
Far Eastern aflairs in Herrick
chapel last night.

Japan's resources have been
badly strained, but have not been
ruined. They have enough re—
sources lett for one more major
offensive.

Lattimore's prophesy is that it
will probably take a form similar
to Sherman‘s march through
Georgia in that Japan will try to
destroy China's crops.

This will take tremendous man-
power, for Japan has to annihilate
the guerrilla warfare that china
has been waging as well as de-
stroy her crops, he said.

"The war started accidentally,
although each side had been pre-
paring for years for inevitable
war. Japan had planned to take
China by a group of small offen-
sive wars or a string of sausage
wars in which section by section
would be taken," lLattimore stab
ed.

The Japanese met with much
more resistance from the chinese
than they expected. This led Je.
pan into a great war instead of
a series of small engagements as
had been previously anticipated.

Lattimore pointed out that,

after this oerns'lve started, the
"rank and file" of the Chinese
started fighting as the result of
some of the Chinese officers from
the north becoming traitors and
joining the Japanese. This brought
the people directly into the war.

“Because China had no super-
ior officers leading her," Latti-
more went on, “Japan could serve
no ultimatum or terms of surrem
der." Thus, the war continued
contrary to Japan’s plan. '

The war at Shanghai was an
unexpected venture on Japan's
part. It was «at this battle that
chiang Kai Shek, the Chinese
'commander, put his German
tr incd soldiers into battle, thus
gi ing the sign for the outlying
provinces to come in.

Japan had to right tor every
foot she gained, in spite of the
fact that she was better equipped
than the Chinese who only had
hand grenades and bayonets with
which to defend themselves in
the broken ruins of buildings,
Lattiinore pointed out.

The turning point of the war.
according to Lattimore, was when
Shanghai tell. It Japan had
pushed on she could have occu-
pied all, the strong points in rapid
succession. She failed to do this,

The Shanghai victory was a
very costly one for Japan for her
army became demoralized, rioted

and became completely out of
control, Lattimore pointed out,

The next phase of the war was
when Japan waged a big oifensive
and tried to cut and seize the
railway communication from
Nanlting to north China.

This defeat was of greater
psychological value than military
value and proved that China
could right a modern war.

“Meantime Japan was drawn
from her long time plan for con-
quest of China,” the speaker ex-
plained. “After she seized Can-
ton, China's life line was cut off.
Up to the time of the taking of
Hankow, Lattiinore said, the
Chinese objective was to hold
the Japanese back and make it
cost more; but after Hanhoiv fell,
this was no longer true. China
then broke up into small groups
and went into guerrilla warfare
and harassed the Japanese.”

China. by her guerrilla warfare,
has brought the Chinese people

 

together, eliminated bandltry, and
has made a brighter outlook for
the country,
