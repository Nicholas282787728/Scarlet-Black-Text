by David Archer

Mark Monigornery, Economics, said rhar while his
grading srandards have not changed in his thirteen years
here. his students have. “[I’ve seen] a real improvement ill
the students," he said “I don’t encounter as many students
{now} who just don’t belong here."

A reporr published by the Committee on Academic
Sraiiding (CA5) Iasr Augusr shows that professois gave
higher grades lass year rhan diey did rive yeais ago. Wheiher
protessors are becoming easier graders or whether siudenrs
are earning higher gmdes wish improved work has yet ro

Tom Moore, who teaches statisth in Grinncll’s Mathe

It is unclear if a more qualiﬁed student body could
explain the rise, but admissions statistics do not suggest a
signiﬁunt rise in qualiry of applicanrs over die rime pe-

in the minurcs rhe CA5 acknowledged rhar grade in

years and that Grinnell is “well within the national norm."

The minurcs emphasized rhe eduearional benehrs of

crinnell smdeno have osperieneeda rise in better grades

Over that peiiod, however, she qualiry ofstudents as
measured by class rank and SAT I scores also increased.
SAT 1 verbal and mar scores increased from roughly 580
ro 500, and average SAT I inaih increued from 600 to
534. The peieeniage ofstudents who came from the rop

thatstudents’ rising academicqiialiricarions, nor inﬂation,
led so higher grades during rhis period.

beiause colleges use smdentaevaluations when considering
