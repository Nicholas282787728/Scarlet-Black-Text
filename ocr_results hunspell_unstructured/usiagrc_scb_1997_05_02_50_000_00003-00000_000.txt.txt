Do Grinnell students still speak and act tip?

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

On this past Wednesday students
were awakened to the fact that one
of the students on campus was sexu—
ally assaulted in her dorm room. By
the time the evening was approach-
ing masses of students across cam»
pus were collecting in lounges across
campus, voicing concern and ex-
pressing frustration. “The sexual as-
sault has all ofa sudden brought out
all of the tensions on campus that no
one else has been talking about. I
think it's a shame that it takes this
one issue to do this. Right now
there's going to be temporary over-
compensation, but it‘s the end ofthe
year and next year will roll around
and it will be back to status quo. And
I hope it does not work outthat way."
said one apprehensive sophomore.
This incident has not only sparked
muchrneeded discussion on the issue
of safety, but it has also brought up
dialogue regarding a number of other
issues including the reality of self»
governance and campus community.
As another anonymous sophomore
added. it has “Taken people and
thrown them back into reality."

This reality that students have been
exposed to has forced them to come
to grips with their own activism on

In the last six
years student
groups have in—
creased by almost
60% from 76 in
1991 to 127 this
semester. Some
would say this
indicates an in—
crease in student ..
activism.

 

campus. As Jennifer Larimer, Alters
native Break organizer. said in rela
tion to campus issues, “There are ale
ways certain issues that students do
have an opinion on. usually because
it affects them in particular." This
occurrence has affected students di-
rectly. But what about student activ-
ism on campus on a more general
level?

In the last six years student groups
have increased by almost 60% from
76 in 1991 to a number this semes—
ter which has reached 127. SGA Vice
President Trevor Porath used this to
describe why he feels that “students
are extremely active.“ Despite this
fact, a number of people expressed

doubts that this figure is an accurate
predictor of student activity. As Dean
Tom Crady said, “Students are some
what less active now than 15 years
ago.“ Yet, he stresses that he sees this
as national phenomenon and that
Grinnell is still “more active than
most other campuses."

Many of the feelings on what the
ambiguous term “student activism"
means stem from the mass demon-
strations of the late 60's, when stu-
dents al Grinnell and other campuses
were attacking large political issues.
Porath emphasized that, “Students'
are doing things like that, but in a
different form." He talked about such
events as the “Line of Silence" be
tween the Forum and Mears Cottage
as evidence of this new form. When
asked if this made a difference,
Porath replied, “I know it did. Board
members took time out ofthe agenda
to talk about the line." While this po~
litical activism still occurs today
Crady believes that the campus is
“much more social action-oriented,"
with an evident increase in commur
nity service involvement. Commue
nity Service Center director Alny
Eilert seconded this feeling, and ex
plained that in the seven years she
has been here. there has been “a
steady increase in the number of
people who help on a constant ba:
sis."

Eilert also explained that the pres
grams that do the best are the ones
that have dynamic leadership, ”Leadr
ership makes all the difference be
cause it has the ability to attract other
students,” Ellen commented. How
ever, many students have expressed
reservations concerning the whole
idea of leadership roles. A number
discussed their uneasiness with ap»
proaching and talking to both student
and administrative leaders on came
pus. However, Porath explained that
he has “found that the administration
is very receptive" and that he has
“never heard of an administrator
turning down someone to talk." Yet
this rift seems to still remain and
brings up bigger conccn'is of whether
Grinnell has a campus community
where faculty, staff and students are
able to communicate with each other.

Recently there have been a number
of successes with student organiza-
tions coming together to achieve
larger goals, Porath brings up the
example of Dining Services. where
three groups, SGA, The Health and
Wellness Committee, and students
petitioning came together in an of
fort to change the board plans. Der
spite these successes the relations
between administrators and students
have become more tenuous as com
munication seems to have reached a
number of stumbling blocks. One
stumbling block which Tom Crady
believed contributes to this miscom-
munication is e-mail. “A lot of con-
cerns come via e-mail," explained
Crady. Asked whether he believed
this hindered communication be
tween students and administrators,
he answered, ”Definitely.” While
Porath believes that “communication

Another important and connected
issue which has come up is that of
scllrgovcrnance and its role and in
teraction with student actiVism.

reason for students to shun anything
outside of their community, One se-
nior explained that “under the sys-
tem of self governance you have to
do things on your own.” Many
people believe in students working
out amongst themselves the issues
that plague the campus. As Poralh
explained in regards to the campus
and student activism. the system “en»
courages self-directed activity" and
the feeling that students are doing it
“all on their own." Some people ar-
gued that this gives students a lot of
room to grow. Others seemed to use
this tojustify their apprehension with
regards to engaging the administra-
tion, As Larimer said, “Students want
to keep campus issues among stun
dents." She pomted out that this exe
cluding of administrators from the
student world is evidenced by recent
letters to the S & B written by fac-
ulty and staff which, as she said.

’ “were commented on in a not so‘fa-

vorable'fashion, basically asking
why the faculty and staff had any

business getting involved."

The idea that students should be
responsible for themselves has al-
lowed students to make incredible
gains with programs such as EXCO,
The Experimental College (EXCO)
was pushed through by student lead-
ers and a student initiative and has
shown the ability ofstudent to direct
positive changes somewhat autonor
mously However, as Larimcr cone
eluded, “Students don‘t want to re
clue that the issues that they are dealr
ing with now have essentially been
dealt with under various covers by
people in the past, and interaction
with faculty and slaffcan bring inyust
such concepts," This issue of self-
governance and the issue of campus
community are woven togelher as an
integral part ofunderstanding student
activism on campus,

Student activism cannot simply be
placed in relation to these more ab-
stract concepts, but should also be
looked at in more practical terms.
Many people believe student priori-
ties today are more focused towards
academics. There is also a beliefthat
students simply have to sacrifice
some of their academic load in order
to take on their activist role within
the campus community. As Poraih
described, this college “pushes you
to the limit with academics; you
could make academics a full time
job." However, despite this load csc
Coordinator Eilert sees that there is
a need and deSirc of people on cam»
pus to get away froin “the brainy
stuff" and focus on pertinent and
practical, real life issues.

The real life issue of sexual assault
that this campus has been exposed
to this week has, as one RLC den
scribed, “popped the bubble," Ho
ever, with regards to student activ-
ism most students, Larimer said,
“like to sit back and watch and offer
their mput as a Cowles and Quad
discussion topic", Ultimately,
whether the discussion of campus
safety accompanying this assault and
that of student activism on campus
will change from the agenda of din-
ner conversation to the agenda ofthe
campus is something yet to be seen,

but the coming weeks will provide

an opportunity for students to voice
their concerns and frustrations.

Hey there Bastion,

Maturity is really overrated. I’m

General Colin Powell helps out with neighborhood clean—up

RISE makes its mark-
in Philadelphia

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Staff Writer

AtSunday’sSummitforAmerica’s
Future, President Clinton, Jimmy
Caner, Nancy Reagan, Barbara and
George Bush, Lady Bird Johnson,
Colin Powell, an assortment of high
ranking CEOS, and many of the
nation's youth leaders convened in
Philadelphia to promote
volunteerism. Across toWn, three
Grinnell College students were pare
ticipating in a protest which took dif
ferent, if not opposing, positions on
many ofthe same issues.

Members of the political action
group RISE Journeyed for forty
hours, paying from their own pock-
ets to attend the March for Jobs, Jus-
tice and People’s Needs sponsored
by the National People‘s Campaign
in Philadelphia. Of several
Grinnellians initially slated to attend
the march, Brooke Heaton, Timour
Rhaman and Anne Walsh made the
trip, which was the last major event
for RISE members this year.

“We felt that the summit was a lot
of posturing and a ﬁg leaf for wel-
fare cutbacks," said Heaton. He ex-
pressed :1 fear that these cuts would
“force people to work at almost povr
erty level,”

“There were a lot of pictures ofAl
Gore and George Bush cleaning up,"
said Heaton. “Of course what good
is it to have a clean playground if
you’re not safe-there?"

The National People’s Campaign’s
convention brought up flaws in the
philosophy behind the current weir
fare and workfare plans. “Under
workfare people go into companies
and work basically at subsistence
wages," Heaton said.

“A lot of CEOs were promoting
policies for emloyees, paying them
for community service,“ said Heaton.
who suggested an alternative solu-
tion, “If the corporations want to
help. they should volenteer to subsi-
dize welfare and workfare."

Although the RISE students were
participating in a leftist demonstra-
tion, members of the political right
had similar opinions regarding the
goals ofthe summit. “Conservatives
also acknowledged that volunteerism
is a little naive," said Heatoi'l.

The March for Jobs, Justice and
People’s Needs had a broad scope
that was not limited to criticism of
the Summit for America’s Future
agenda, The protest started with a
rally where there were around 30
speakers. Representatives of the
Gaeresbian-Bisexual-
Transgendered community, the
American Indian Movement (AIM)
and the Socialist Workers Party were
there. Monica Moorehead, Socialist
candidate for president in 1996,
spoke. Several black nationalst par-
ties and Latino/a groups were
present, as well. “Regardless of your
cause." Heaton said, “all the disen-
franchised groups who ér’eiindeiﬁi—"u
tack by the political powers that be 1
were present."

Although neither was able to attend.
Leonard Peltier of AIM and Mumia
AburJamal, whom Heaton described
as political prisoners, were dontinant
topics at the protest. “Major themes
were freeing political prisoners and
ending police violence, imprisoning
killer cops," said Heaton.

“The march deﬁnitely had a lot to
do with [RISE]," Heaton said, “be
cause it wasn't narrow. it had a
myriad of causes."
