Woodie King,
"Renaissance Man
of Black Theater" on
Campus Nov. 21-22

Woodic King, Jr., a
prominent figure tn the Black
Theater Movement. will be on
campus Monday and Tuesday,
Nov. 21 and 22. King has been
called the renaissance man of
black theatcr. He has written
short stories, essays, plays. and
screenplays for both television
and film. He has also acted, di»
tcctcd, and producal.

In 1981, most of his writ-
ings on the black theater were
published in his collection of 6s
says, Black Theater Present Con-
dition. In his writings he speaks
of a black theater that addresses
and embraces its community and
ignores the European and Ameri-
can traditions of the white com-
mercial stage. In his stories and
ﬁlms he explores contemporary
urban life. through the vehicle of
the black family.

The day before King at-
rives. Sunday, Nov. 20, his
movie, The Black Theater
Movement: From Raisin in the
Sun to the Present, will be
shown in ARI-i 115 at 8 pm.

While on campus. King
will be involved in a number of
activities and will make two pre»
sentations: a seminar at 4:15
pm. in Carnegie 213 and a leo-
ture later that evening in Main
Lounge. Contrary to the infor-
mation published in the Memo,
the afternoon seminar is the less
formal of the two presentations.
Also. the evening talk is in Main
Lounge, rather than South
Lounge as earlier publicized.

TS. Eliot Centennial Reading

Students in the modem po-
etry class will give a T.S. Eliot
reading on Tuesday evening,
Nov. 22, at 7:30 p.m. in Main
Lounge. Come and hear Eliot's
poetry revived. All are welcome
and as an added incentive refresh-

Duck Soup -- a Grinnell'

tradition

by Brian Strause

In Duck Soup the Marx
Brothers ridicule diplomatic con-
ferences and climatic chase scenes
in a ﬁlm that serves as a satire on
the inconsistencies of govern-
mental process, Groucho plays
Rufus T. Fireﬂy, the Prime
Minister of Freedonia, a fictional
Balkan country. Zeppo aids
Groucho as his secretary. Harpo
and Chico not only occupy cabi-
nct positions, but also moonlight
as sprcs for the enemy.

The humor ofDuek Soup
is based in surrealism, one-liners,
and puns. When the state brings
Chico to trial for treason, the
prosccutor declares. "We’ll have
to eliminate that testimony."
Chico smugly replies, "I'll have a
eliminate, too. Ice cold." It is
only natural that the instigator of
such humor should become in-
volved in war.

Harpo gallantiy embarks on
a Paul Revere ride to warn his
fellow countrymen of the
oncoming attack by Sylvania, a

neighboring country. However, a
pretty woman in a window
catches his eye -— a sight clearly
worth investigating. Before he
knows it, Harpo finds himself
immersed in thc bathtub, hiding
from the woman's husband.
When her husband finally leaves.
Harpo takes the next logical step
as dictated by this once-in-a-lifer
limc opportunity, and leads his
horse into the house. What a
laugh riot this must have causcd
when this film Was released in
1933.

In short,Dttc/t Soup is full
of classic scones, including the
often copied mirror cpisodc in
which Groucho and Chico
"reflect" one another's actions
with perfect precision. This film
is becoming a Grinnell tradition,
so you are only punishing your-
self if 'ou miss a swim in this
sea of puns and hilarious satire.

.2?!

by Matt Macho

This is the third and proba-
bly last of the Road War-
rior/postwar wasteland, death
movies. As such it's pretty
much a must see for big fans of
wild mayhem and senseless vio-
lence, or of Mel Gibson, once
again the throbbing sex symbol
in leather and Road Warrior ex-
n-aordinaire.

This one takes place several
years after the second, Road War-
rior. Max, the cx»policemart who
no longer gives a damn about
anything but survival, now lives
in a world even more empty of
fuel (let alone civilization or cul-
ture) than before, and stumbles
on "Bartcrtown," a small city
which has electrical power gener-
ated from methane (via pig shit).
The matriarch of the city. Tina
Turner, hires Max to kill Mas-
terblaster, this dwarf-giant tag
team which threatens her power.
Tina does a pretty good job,
though I think Grace Jones might
have been a better choice -- more
wild and violent.

This leads to the high point
of the movie, the incredibly sick
and bizarre fight scene in the
Thunderdome. It's seldom that

Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome

you see a really unique and origi-
nal fight scene, one that hasn't
been done many times before.
Trust me, there has NEVER been
a fight scene like this.

On the down side, the
movie is somewhat lacking in
the senseless punk mayhem of
the first two movies, sometimes
lapsing into unspeakably stupid
sentimental goo. Someone
please tell me, what possessed
them to put a sappy bunch of
kids in a Mad Max film? Go
watch Walt Disney if you want
wholesome entertainment. Gibr
son looks a bit haggard in this
one -- deﬁnitely not quite as hot
as previously. The final chase
scene is also not as good as Road
Warrior » but that's an impossi-
ble act to follow.

I guess one problem is that
this movie has to follow Road
Warrior -» how could it possibly
match it in violence and wild-
ness? This one is easily good for
a night of drunken entertainment
at least on par with the ﬁrst of
the series if not the second.
