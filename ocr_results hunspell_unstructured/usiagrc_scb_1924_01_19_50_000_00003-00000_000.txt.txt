 

A PROPOSED PEACE PLAN

(The proposals oi our pence plan and the machinery ior their execution
are presented in pandlol columns.-

Edl'tor's Note: The following summary of a plan entered in the

recent Bok Peace Plan contcst is printed through ‘tue coul'~
tesy oi the writers, Profs. C. E. Payne, v. F. Morris, and G. Iv.
Rutherlord.

The complete plan embraces attempts 1st, to heal certain
tempol'dl'l sorc spots in the Europe or today; 2nd. to providc
machinery ior preventing friction in the future, and for settling
disputes as thcy arise; 3rd, to develop “a will‘l‘ol‘ peace" among the
nations through education; ith, to induce the United States to
take a lead in these movements, and to restore the high moral
enthusiasm which characterized the American people during the
wa ; and 5th, to reduce governmental action to a minimum, and
to rely upon private initiative. so as to take these questions out of
the r‘ealm ol partisan politics.

The writers realize that some of the propositions may seem
startling, us here presented in outline Term, and only wish that
space allowed them to submit the arguments supporting the
various features in their plan.
