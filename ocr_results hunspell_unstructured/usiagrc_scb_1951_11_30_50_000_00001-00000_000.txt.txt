robes Student Dissatisfaction

Should the student council be
holished? That was the question l
hich kindled a heated discusw
on last night at the joint meetj l

of the Student Council,
eague Board, c of HP, and so-
al committee;

Definite proof was shown in
e meeting that the student,
)Cly is not satisfied with the]

-esent student government set-i

on campus. There is greatl
fficuity, however, in pointing;
it specific means of improve-i
ent because of the wide vare
ty of opinions among the stu—
-nts themselves.

Tile main question discussed
the meeting was the status of
e student Council in relation
the C of HP, League Board
id central committee. A list‘
the specific issues made dur-l

the discussion of this probei

was made and an agenda oil
lestions to be voted on by the

riod will follow the talks.

Ilege leaders;

Student Council at their next
meeting will be drawn up from

the list. .

The questions include: Should
the Student Council act as a

court of appeal? Should it he
established as a central power
between north and south cam-
pus? Should the central come
mittc and Student Council be
combined? Should there be a
central body consisting of both
men and women to handle probe
lems arising on both north and'
south campus?

Should tha college keep the
structure it now has and simply
make it stronger or should the
whole system be torn down and
completely rebuilt? Due to the
conflict of opinions among thcsc
present at the meeting, no def-
inite decision was reached last
night, but these questions will
be facing the council at its next
meeting and will be voted on at
that time.
