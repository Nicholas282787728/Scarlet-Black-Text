He watched the
- pot as it boiled

Thousands of people had watched the
boiling pot, but Count Rumford won-
dered why it boiled. He did more than
wonder; by scientiﬁc research he
found out for himself.

And Rumford laid the foundation of
the greatest generalization the human
mind has yet conceived—the law of
the conservation of energy.

Scientists in the Research Laboratories
of the General Electric Company are
devoting their lives to pure reSearch,
carrying on the work of Rumford and
other pioneers of modern science. By
methodical investigation, the frontier
of scientiﬁc knowledge is being pushed
steadily forward.
