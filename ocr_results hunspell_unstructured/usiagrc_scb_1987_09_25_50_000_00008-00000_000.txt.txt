Editorial/Opinion

Student offended
by letter’s call to
fecus on Ini’l

racism

To the Editor:

A letter to the editor in the Sept, 4
issue oi the Scarlet and Black
enraged, disgusted, and oiiended
me. it was a reply to the editorial
concerning the iact that the ad
ministration neglected to provide
an identiiying marker for the
Black Cultural Center. The letter
enraged me because it obscured
the real issue which, ior the
record, is institutionalized racism.

Although Margaret Litts and
Robert Killion’s comments were
probably well intentioned, they urr
wittingly made the painiul task oi
speaking out against racism even
more diiiicult. They beiittled what
they described as an editorial writ
ten with “an obvious lack oi in-
telligence or foresight” and recomr

Corredtion

mended, albeit implicitly, that we
focus on an international example
oi racism rauier than the bigotry
that exists in our own communities
and particulary this campus.

For me as a black woman living
in a society still exhibiting latent
aspects of racism. this issue is just
as serious as apartheid in South
Africa: in fact, it is more serious
because it is something we have to
confront on a daily basis. It is ime
portant to light racism on an inter-
national scale but not by neglec-
ting it on a more personal one.
Thus, while the omission oi a
marker for the Black Cultural
Center might seem at first trivial.
it is in fact a grave reminder of the
racism which we so often overlook.

Prejudice in America:

Society's cbmpiacency
reflected on campus

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to a let
ter in the September 4th edition of
the Scarlet and Black. The letter
criticized the Scarlet and Black‘s
editorial on the omission of a
marker for the Black Cultural
Center ior being “criticism tor the
Sake of criticism,” stating that it
lacked “intelligence or foresight."
The concluding sentence, which
read, “It is unfortunate that the S
and B chose to begin...on such a
juvenile note.” combined with the
overall tone of the letter and the
authors' assertion that me Scarlet
and Black would be more effective
in denouncing the evils of racism in
South Airica, leit me ieeling
dismayed and saddened.

The authors of the letter attacks
ed the editorial for what they con-
sidered to be its unwarranted
criticism of the administration's
oversight; in their words, “we
doubt the administration’s over-
sight in identiiying the Black
Cultural Center is reflective of any
underlying prejudices. While 1
do not believe the administration’s
omission was deliberate or
malicious, l think it is indicative of
our society‘s complacency, its allr
too common attitude of “we’ve
done a lot already." The ad-
ministration has in the past voiced
their commitment to attracting
minority students; yet, given an
ideal opportunity to reaiiirm their

~vnmitment, they made an unibr-

.Iate and embarrassing error. A

iarker placed prominently out
Side the Black Cultural Center
would have signaled the pride
Grinnell takes in its diverse and
talented student body; instead, as
the embarrassment oi their gross

oversight was pointed out to them
(sadly they did not seem to have
recognized it themselvesl, the ad
ministration belatedly placed one
outside the iacility.

Of course, I agree that the atrocir
ty oi apartheid must be eradicated
and that black South Africans must
be ireed to enjoy parity with their
white peerso As the son of a South
African father and a lormer resi-
dent of that nation, 1 have witness-
ed, albeit from the protected stand
point or my race, the injustices oi
apartheid, We should do
everything possible to dismantle
the apartheid system; however,
this should not be at the expense of
what is to be Corrected within our
communities. Racism in all
diverse permutations, be it against
Blacks, AsianrAmericans, or per-
sons oi Spanish origin, exists in
America today, and the fight to end
it must be a relentless one. While
we decry apartheid in South
Airica, the ugly and pervasive
specter oi racist actions and
thoughts lingers within our own
world, Any campaign to end apar-
theid in South Africa is inevitably
undermined by the fact that
racism prevails in erica.
Before we gain any credi ty with
the South Airican government and
her people, we must end all ex-
amples oi racism in our society

1 know personally one student
who was deeply hurl by the letter.
Perhaps with more thought and
Consideration, the letter would
never have been written and that
student’s pain, and that or others,
would have been avoided, it is un-
fortunate that this did not occur 7

Athletes defend coach against
charges of bias

Dear Editor,

We and many other members of
the soccer, tennis, and baseball
teams would like to respond to the
serious accusations leveled by Jon
Stillman at Coach Pfitsch. Anyone
‘who has played ior coach, which
Mr, Stillman has not, knows that
coach jokes constantly about
where you are irom be it lowa or
Nepal. it you play ior him tor any
amount oi time you have un-
doubtedly been ridiculed because
you come irom the West Coast or
Kansas or Oklahoma or even
Brazil. These are not “racial
slurs“ but simply part oi the
chiding coach uses to keep your at
tention when trying to make a
more serious point about the game.

Mr. Stillman claimed that there
is a bias against putting ioreigners
on the varsity soccer squad, 1
would like to point out that there
are in fact three international
students on the varsity. Mr.
Stillman points to “many capable
ioreign players“ on the JV as an
example oi this supposed bias.
Where Mr. Stillman got his ability

' to judge soccer talent is unclear.

Evaluation of soccer skills and
team commitment cannot be
measured objectively, unlike ten-
nis where players can be evaluated
by head to head competition. on
Piitsch’s soccer teams, players

are selected by Piitsch and the
Captains with indirect input and
support irom the players
themselves. Pfimch is unique in
that he encourages input and ideas
irom his players, unlike many
coaches who rule a team much like
an absolutist monarch, The fact of
the matter is, each athlete,
regardless oi nationality, has the
same opportunity to make 3
Pfitsch team based on skill and the
ability oi the player to carry out
the responsibilities within a define
edsystem.

Furthermore, Mr. Stillman’s
observation that the “only two
players given the extra blue
uniiorms to wear happened to be
the only two black players on the
team" is false, Practice uniforms
are distributed on a first come first
serve basis, so other American late
arrivals also received blue
uniiorms. This policy in addition to
the fact that distribution of prac
tice jerseys is not even under
Piitsch's control would seem to
make Mr. Stillman’s accusation
purely unsubstantiated.

Mr. Stillman's appraisal of
coach’s comments at last year’s
soccer meeting is a gross misinterr
pretation of Coach PfiLsch's point,
Coach's intention was /to stress
commitment towards iorming a

team competitive in this league,
not to exclude 0r discriminate
against foreign players during the
first week oi practice or any other
time. In doing 50, Coach Pfitsch
was straightiorward enough to talk
about what Mr. Stillman was sur-
prised to hear and call “his policy
toward foreign Students," Pfitsch
simply stated that the foreign
students’ adjustments to Grinnell
as well as a different Style of socr
cer are diiiicult, especially during
the first week. His basis for this
observation simply being 39 years
of coaching and teaching ex-
perience at Grinnell, experiences
as a coach in Portugal and
Ecuador, as well as hosting
several exchange studenB in his
own home

We find it very disturbing this
letter ever had to be written. It just
seems to us that a place as open
minded as Grinnell College
wouldn't have to deal with ill-
informed and untrue slander
against a well respected and long
time member of the Grinnell Col-
lege community. John Plitsch
needs to be thanked not crucified.

Mortar Board
celebration
ignored by

students

To the Editor:

Last Thursday aiternoon the
Grinnell Chapter of Mortar Board,
like hundreds of Mortar Board
chapters across the nation, planted
a tree and released balloons in
honor of the 200th anniversary of
the US. Constitution. Anybody
who went to the SGA meeting the
previous Wednesday night heard
about it, and numerous signs were
placed around campus.

1 don't know how the ceremony
was put on by those other Mortar
Boards, but at ours the Mayor oi
Grinnell gave a speech; Professor
Al Jones, a resident expert on the
Constitution, gave a speech; both
men helped plant the tree while a
man from the Grinnell Herald»
Register took photos; and a dozen
children from the Grinnell pre~
school released balloons and
helped shovel dirt into the hole.

I also don’t know who attended
those other tree-plantings. Grins
nell College was r epresented by six
or seven Mortar Board members,
a few of their friends, and one or
two passersby. Probably some or
the people studying in Burling
looked out the south windows and
wondered what we were doing out
there on the lawn

Now, I‘m not generally impress-
ed by ceremonies and speeches,
and I admit thal if I hadn't been in
Mortar Board. 1 might not have
gone to this one. I didn’t watch the
gala celebration of Miss Liberty's
birthday, and I tend to switch

channels when President Reagan
gives a press conierence. But it
seems rather ironic to me that.
although this campus is concerned
enough about the constitutional
righm ot Americans to launch a
major protest oi the consideration
oi Justice Bork ior a position on the
Supreme Court, there were not
even a dozen students at the com-
memoration oi the Constitution‘s
longevity. Alter all, even ii Bork's
nomination is approved, the Con-
stitution will still be able to limit
his power, to prevent him irom
taking over the government or the
entire nation, as it has prevented
such dictatorship ior 200 years.
That seems to me to be worth
celebrating, or at least worth
thinking about.

So the next time you're heading
to Burling or Fine Arts or into town
to get some popcorn, take a minute
to look at the newest tree on the
campus: south lawn. It‘s a small
one, a white oak, not much taller
than the average Grinnell student.
it doesn't look like much now...but
then, not everybody who heard
about the new Constitution 200
years ago was impressed by it,
either with some personal care
and a little bit oi luck, both the tree
and the Constitution should be
around when you come back ior
your class reunion — and when
your children (and maybe their
children) come back ior theirs _
