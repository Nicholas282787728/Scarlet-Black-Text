Gustalson Resigns SéwB Position

 

Alden Sees Petri as One Possessing Thai Exceedingly
Uncommon Greatness Which Is Entirely Aware of Itself

By Henry Alden

it is a rare privilege for anyone
anywhere to hear a great musician
like Egon Petri. Such a privilege
is doubly rare in a small cams
munity like Grinnell far from the
metropolitan centers. And not
only to hear one recital but to
hear at least three and in addition
to become acquainted with the
artist when he is not on the
formal concert stage is indeed an
experience that is unforgettable.

Ostensibly my assignment is to
review the recital given by Egon

Museum Mystery
Solved With Aid
Of Dr. Adams

Grinnelrs Parker Museum last
week solved a mystery that has
puzzled Louisville, Ky. museum
officials for four year

In 1937, during the Ohio river
ﬂood. indentification tags were
lost for valuable geological Speci<
mens. including casts of the
famous gold nuggets of the
world.

Last week. Dr. Adams located
duplicate casts of two of the
nuggets in the Parker Museum
and sent sketches of them to the
Louisville experts.

With Dr. Adams’ sketches
identification was made of the
“Eldorado” and “Welcome" nug-
gets. the last of the specimens
the Louisville scientists had been
unable to name.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petri in the High School audi—
torium last Sunday afternoon. but
it is impossible to divorce that
event from the other events of
Mn Petri’S weekend stay on the
Gzinnell campus.

Although the public recital on
Sunday was officially the high
point of that stay. whether or not
it actually was is a moot point.
One of Petri's chief claims to
greatness is the authority with
which he plays the music of many
composers; his only limitation
seems to be the selfeimposed one
that he will play only pieces of

real musical worth. With a gen-
erosity that has become the talk
of the campus, Petri supplement-
ed his Sunday program with other
informal recitals so that all in all
he touched upon a large part of
European music. The correct apr
plicatiou of the term “high point"
is. therefore. a matter of individr
ual taste, dependent upon one’s
evaluation of the works of vari-
ous composers; for he played them
all well.
