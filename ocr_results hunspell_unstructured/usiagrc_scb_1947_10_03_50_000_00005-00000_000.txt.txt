OCTOBER 3, I947

Tomorrow afternoon on Ward
Field, Coach "Bunny" Oakes’
gridmen will attempt to put a
mark in the win column of the
midwest conference standingsl
when they meet Knox college, 111i
both teams- conference opener.,

Eager to balance last week'sl
6-0 defeat, the Pioneers will bel
out to tally victory No. 4 over‘
the Knox eleven. That victory
would give Crinnell a 4-3 record
over the purple and gold of
Galesburg, Ill.

However, Coach Cakes is skepr
tical and for good reasons. Last
year's Knox team gained an 18-
s victory over the Pioneers, and
many returning lettermen will
again make the Calesburg eleven
a strong competitor. In their in-
itial game this season, the purple
and gold staged a last-quarter
passing attack, good for two
counters and a 13—6 victory over
Dubuque college.

In preparation for the Satur-
day afternoon encounter, Coach
Oakes is putting his team through
stiff offensive paces. Colds and
slight injuries make top physi-
cal shape questionable, but Men-
tor Oakes is banking on the
same starting eleven as against
Colorado last week.

The probable starting lineups
are:

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Pioneers’ Conierence Drive
Opens Tomorrow vs. Knox

Pioneers Lose
Opening TiH’
To Tigers, 6-0

Lasf Quarl'er Score
Ends Puniing Baffle

A juggled, recovered pass by
Colorado college with ten min-
utes left to play in the game
gave the Tigers the opportunity
that was needed to break a score»
less struggle on Ward field,
Sept. 26. Colorado then went over
in four plays to make what
proved to be a 6»0 margin of
victory.

This touchdown drive high—
lighted the contest, with the
first three quarters for the most
part a punting duel between Hal
French, Tiger punting ace, and
Herb White, Grinnell right end.
Both teams kept strictly to the
ground during the first quarter,
and mid-way in the quarter it
looked as though Kermiti stein-
beck, Pioneer quarterback, was
going to have things his own
way. In three plays Steinbeck
carried the bail for 19 yards but
was injured on an eight-yard
jaunt.

Second Quarter

The second quarter saw Color-
ado college take to the air, after
Freyer, Colorado RHB, inter-
cepted a Crinnell pass and
brought the ball to the 33-yard
line in Pioneer territory, the
farthest the Tigers had pene-
trated up to this point in the
game. However, Grinnell's line,
which proved itself in the course
of the game held, and Colorado
was forced to kick.

Third Quarter

After a 45de boot by Herb
White, the Tigers again launched
their aerial offensive, but this
time it was cut short when Fred
Webb, Crinnell right halfback,
intercepted a pass on his own
so and ran it back five yards.
{a recovered Colorado fumble by
Grinnell on their own 40 ended
the third quarter.

Fourth Quarter

In the final period, the Pion-
eers kicked deep into Colorado
territory. The Tigers moved up
the field for a first down on suc-
cessive jaunts by Fryer and
Pringlc, Then Pn'ngle, Tiger
quarterback, heaved a long pass
down into Grinnell territory where
it bounced off the receiver's
chest and into the arms of Harry
Waters, former Crinnell gridiron
star. He carried it to the 22-yard
marker. Bob Pringle finished the
drive with successive gains,
plunging for the decisive score

Pep Club Heads
Named By Council

Dorothy ,Darr, James junior
was appointed chairman of the
newly-organized Pep club at the
Sept. 30 meeting of the student
Council. Bill O'Brien, Cowles
sophomore; Jane Gunderson,
Haines sophomore; and Jim Rich-
ter, Rawson freshmen, were se-
lected as the other members of
the governing committee of the
club.

The function of the Pep club
is to establish a more effective

and better organized cheering
section at all intercollegiate ath-
letic activities. It was agreed by
the council that, in order to
achieve their objective, the Pep
club would be grouped around
the 50-yard line in the football
stands.

from the 3ryard no. The attempt
for the extra point was not good.

Fumbles by both teams negated
any remaining scoring possibilh
ties, and the game ended with
Colorado on top 6-0.

to make clear that the Sail-let

inions, productive criticisms. and
ideas, pertinent to local or nat-
ional sports or to anything con-
ltalned in this column.

5 Hats off to head grid mentor
§"Bunny” Oakes for whipping the
-Pioneer eleven into good shape in
such a short time. A light line
held well, a small backfield fun-
rationed smoothly from the single
wing, and supurb punting by
right end Herb White, highlighted
the initial contcst against Colo-
rado college With an added week
of practice and stiff offensive drill,
we can look toward the Knox
lgame wini high hopes.

Perhaps a break in the un-
written law of the south re-
fusing negro participation in
intercollegiate competition has
at last occured, Athletic Direc-
tor Norton Pritehett of Virgin-
ia ruiiversity announced last
week that Chester Pierce, big
negro tackle, would be in the
line-up when Virginia meets
Harvard on Oct. 14. Pritcliett
said it would be the first time,
so far as he knew, that a
negro boy had performed on a
southern gridiron. And why not:
Track Coach Francis Cretz~
