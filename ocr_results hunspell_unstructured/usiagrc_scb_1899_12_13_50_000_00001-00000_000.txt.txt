The Inter-Society Debate.

Theannual joint debate between
the Chrestomatliian society and
the Grinnell Institute, to decide
the speakers tor the Cmiiell des
bate, was held inthe chapel on
last Saturday evening in the pres
ence of an audience which ought
to have been larger. The quess
tion for debate was as follows:
Resolved, that under existing cons
ditions the abolition of the armies
and navies of all countries, except
so much as may be needed ior
domestic police, is feasible. The
Chrestomathian society, rcprer
sented by S. H. Crosby, A Ri er
and R L, Parker, supported the
afﬁrniaiive, while J, G. Swan, M,
Macartney and BK. Campbell
sustained the opposite View in
behalf of the Institute. Both
sides put up a strong debate, but
the judges of the debate, Messrs.
R. Macdonald, D. A. Thoi'nbtirg
and Prof. B. E. Powell, rendered
their decision in favor of the at-
ﬁrmative by a vote of two to one.
The judges on speakers, Prof.
Simmons. l’rof, Macy and Rev.
E. M. Vitt‘um. decided that Mr.
Campbeilaud Mr. Macaitney or
the Grinnell Instittitc and Mr.
Parker of the Clircstomatliian
Society should represent G inriell
in the Cornell debate. with Mr.
Crosby as substitute.

Messrs. Delaven and way
opened the program by acornet
duet, after which Proi Parker, as
presiding ofﬁcer, read the question

Mr. Closby opened the ai'gu»

stated as the claim of the afﬁrma-
tive that crvilieatrori has reached
such a state that war riiay be dis-
pensctl with. The reudai pi'iiicir
pic ofstiiie has been outgrown,
and arbitration is the only method
of settling (llriplllcs. War has be-
come the ﬁnal desperate resource
of nations and an undesirable iris

been used by thirtyronc nations

afﬁrmativcmtist prove that dISr
armament can be accomplished
under existing conditions, that it
can be brought about in all has
tions, and that it is feasible. The
afﬁrmative must also show how
armaments can be abolished and
must propose a teasihlc scheme
upon which all nations can agree
and which will be proot against
any contingencies that may arise
The negative tlocx' not deny the

govcrnrngciasses, which are no obs
stacle to disarmament.

Mr. Macartncv repeated
statement that the negative were
willing to grant the desudbility oi
disarmament. He argued that
disarmament is impossible tinder
existing conditions on account of
the distrust and jealousy which
exist between nations. Peace
may exist, but it is an armed
peace, and nations reach agree-
merit through fear. The Peace
Coniercnce decided nothing save
that peace was desirable, which
does not enter into the question.
Governments founded on militar-
ism, as France, will never agree
to disarmament.

Mr. Parker, for the aFﬁrmative,
set forth his argument clearly unr
der six heads, as follows: that
armaments have been out-grown
by crvrlization; that armaments
serie no necessary purpose, being
necessary neither for arbitration
or the maintenance of commerce;
that public opinion supports dis
armament; that militarism is in
consistent with democracy; that
disarmament is necessary to avoid
inevitable conﬂict; and that the
toilet irorn the heavy burden or
taxation is imperative.

Mr. Campbell, in closing for the
negative, laid special stress on
the fact that arbitration has never
been successtul in disputes involv.
ing national honor; neither does
arbitration moan justice, since it
derives all its force front the ar
nutrients back ot it. He reiterT
ated the statement that the ques
tlonat issue was feasibility, not
desirability, and that political

conditions at present are such as
to render disarmament tmpusslr
ble. The afﬁrmative must not re-
ly on evolution to support tthr
claim, and have prudticed no
scheme to do away with national
distrust. The opposition of gov-
ernments is an unsurinouniable
obstacle to disarmament.

Mr Risser. in rebuttal, stated
that disarmament is not iinpuss‘ir
ble, although it may not be proba-
ble. The question is leasiblc be-
cause it. is desirable. Public
