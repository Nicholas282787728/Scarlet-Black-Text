Requests for Better Dressed Men
To Be Ignored Until Army Steps In

By Ken Mathews.
Among the rumors prevalent on
til-c campus about the many
changes scheduled for Grinncll,
one sccms destined to incet some
opposition from the dormitories.

Accoidiiig to sometimes reliable
sources, a movement already ap-
proaching the proportions of a
major whispering campaign has
been launched by leaders in the
administration to raise the stan-
dard of appearance of Grinnell
mcn.

Indications from those sources

are that the exponents of the
qtlal‘tel‘»5leeves, thc sweatshirt
and courdoroy slacks will be defi-
nitely frowncd upon from hence-
forth

Undoubtedly quadrangle resi-
dents will support the campaign
as will clothiers of this tel'l'i»
tory, but dormitory talk seems to
indicate that the sartorial stan-
dam of tile Grinncu male, which
has been called that of a cow-
college, will remain at a status
quo until military training makes
necessary a change to olive-drab.
