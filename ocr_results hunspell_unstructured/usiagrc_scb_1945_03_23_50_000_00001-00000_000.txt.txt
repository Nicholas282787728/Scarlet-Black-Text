“That Which One Petitions”

”A mans best friend is his dog"
according to that old, old saying,
but Crinncll students can say,
“A student's best friend is the
personnel board.”

Very few of us realize how
true that really is. The persona
nel board is composed of ten
members, Dr. Earl D. strong.
dean of the college, is chairman.
other members are Miss Evelyn
Gardner, dean of women; Pro-
fessor J. W. Charlton, dean of
men; Miss Bethana McCandless,
registrar; Dr, George D. Lovell.
director of personnel; Professor
Paul Spencer Wood, chairmen of
the faculty; Mr. Charles L.
Kaufman, director of accounts:
and three representatives of the
faculty, Professors G. o Gale.
Mack '1‘. Henderson, and Norman
Goodbrod.

This most august assembly, as
you can see, represents almost

 

every phase or the administra-
tion, and somewhere among
those ten people there is sure
to be someone who knows you
and is your friend, Although the
personnel board acts as a policy
determining body for such mab
ters as academic standing of stu-
dents and the granting of schol-
arships, most students know it
as “that which one petitions,"
for practically everything.

Do you want to go home for
an extended weekend? You
must petition the personnel
board. Did you miss a class on
a five-dollar out day, through
some misunderstanding? Peti-
tion the personnel board to he
excused from paying the fine.
Do you want to carry an extla
heavy load of student employ
ment hours? petition the pore
sonnel board.

In fact, for practically every.

i

 

thing, petition the personnel
board In iuost cases, unless it
means a radical departure fr m
college policy, your petition will
be granted. The personnel board
has been instituted to help the
students, and give them a fair
hearing.

Among its specific duties, the

board passes on every individual‘

cases of probation and release
from probation, It considers el—
igibility for campus activities,
honor lists, class absences,
awarding of scholarships, trans-
ferring credits, student employ-
ment, special examination sche-
dules, program for new student
days, and qualiﬁcations of stu-
dents.

So, you see, whenever any.
thing goes wrong, and you need
expert and kind advice turn to
the student's bcst friendipeti-
tion the personnel board.

The play, covering a period of
about six years (the productive
era in the lives of the Brontes),
is divided into six scenes. The1
tragedy develops in those scenes
with the degeneration of the
weak brother, Branwell, the lib
erary triumphs of Emily, Ann,
and Charlotte, and the ironic
sacrifices that the girls make
for their brother. The play de-
‘picts the tragic deaths of three
members of the Bronte family.

Construction of Set

The set is constructed
Iactual photographs of
Brontes home, a parsonage

England. Its outstanding fea-‘
ture is a portrait of Charlotte
(Virginia Foote), Emily (Mar-
guerite Watson), and Ann (Bare
para Macoubreyi. It is an oil
painting done by Mrs. Kent An-
drews and in the play is sup
posed_ to have been done by Bran-
well. The portrait was paintedl
from photographs of the players
made.by Constance Rounds, Read
,junior, and from actual sittings
by the group. The set was Con-s
structed by the production class,
which also helped to make the
costumes. The latter were deal
lsigued by Kent Andrews, drama
l lnstructor.

Moor Born, the first play
about the Brontes to be given in
this country, opened in New
York in 1934, and was produced
by George Bushhar and John
Tuerk. It was written by Dan
Totheroth, and the version to be
presented here has been exten—
|slvely revised by Mr. Andrews.

Cast Members

The complete cast-of the play
is as follows: Charlotte, Virginia
Foote: Emily, Marguerite Wat-
son; Ann, Barbara Macoubrey;
Tabby. the maid, Alice Powers;
Branwell, stuart Roeder; the
Rev. Patrick Bronte, David
Gotham; Martha, a maid, Mar—
‘gztret Roland.

e

Behind the scenes of Moor Born
is a spirit unknown to most of
the audience . . a “spirit” in thel
person of William Benson, pro
fcssor emeritus of Greek at coe
college in Cedar Rapids.

Since his retirement, "Daddy”
Benson, as he is known to stu-
dents of the production classes,
has taken an active interest in
the theater, especially the Grin-
nell college theater. Hc arrives
at the home of Kent Andrews,
drama instructor, just when the
work on a play is heaviest .
when the sets are being built,
painted, ’and moved.

Working with students, who do
much of the actual set construc—
tion, Daddy Benson gives gui -
ance, encouragement, anrl, plenty
of hard labor.

A Grinnell theater play is in»
complete Without him, and he
tries never to miss a show, To‘
the actors, instructors, and crew,
he is ”the helpful spirit behind
the whole Show." l
