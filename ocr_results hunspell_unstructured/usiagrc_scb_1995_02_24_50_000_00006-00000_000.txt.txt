But the true star, oddly enough, was
Jerry Springer litmselfrnot the gucsts.
He cut a path ﬂirough the audience like a
Scythe, soothing the ovcicxcited crowd

sheep. As the stage began to ﬁll with
transsexuals, rabid racists shouting,
“Yahocxlil”, and bi7arrc manglcs of as
hanged lovers, the image intensiﬁed. ln
