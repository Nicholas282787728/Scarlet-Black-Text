As a uself-styled wit" I feel eon.
slderably dell-ted nnd chnstened.
Never did I dream that the pro.
rogatim and powers of the student
Council were so great in scope.
Fie, Fie, Uncle Kuncle, you‘ve
been giving us a nasty weather
lately and what are you going to

do about the NRA?
a c o

Of course the office of President of
the Student Council is almost bound
to build up a defense mechanism,
Imagine the feelings of the hopeful
candidate who tinds himself elected to
such a high oitice and then has to
elect a pep queen to keep himself
busyl

noo-

oi course the professor who

, asked Mr. Kuncl at the meeting
of the curriculum board just whal
he was teaching here is either the
keenest wit on the campus, or he
merely made an honest mistake It
he were a wit, he no donbtrcolized
that Mr. Kuncl’s functions at the
meeting were somewhat similar to
the lunction a picture on the wall
serves. If he made an honest mis-
take, he no doubt took Mr Kuncl
to he a new assistant in the Eng.

lish department.
D I I I

However. let us ‘aue the facts and
still it that as long as the college built
the south parlors. we should be good
ennugh sports to elect a student coun-
cil to use them.

a n u o
But at last the terrific respon-
sibility of the office has descended
to younger shoulders. President

Kuncl has put the cat out and

locked the Bot building int the

last time, [or which he can be
thankllll. Let us be grateful that

Colfax is so close; at least all UK-

presidents can retire there for n

rest-cure alter the mania—racking

year of eilort.
. o e n

In order to present at least one Con—
structive criticism here, wouldn’t it
be possible to more closely integrate
the activities of the various student
government bodies on the campus?
It might even be that the Council of
House Presidents could take time out
from hanging white rags on wire
fences and- uprooting stumps to re.
lieve the Student Council of some of
their terrific responsibility.

. e o s
when all is said and done, this
is a large tussover practically
muting. I Say “ironically no-
thing” bonus- cvurih. nest Hus-
ed will admit that the social cum.
mittee has some place on the cam.
pus.
o n o .

Some of the seniors feel that they
have been lulled into a false sense
of security over these comprehensives.
To study {or The Comprehensive: and
then have to take final tests in some
of their courses whether or not seems
to be somewhat of a burden. Of course,
every professor is entitled to give
an hour test whenever he pleases, but
two in a row covering the semester
is a little strong,

s r A a
The picnic to and picnics look
place this week when the mem—
bers of Sigma Delta Chi swam in
from Westﬁeld in a sea of mud
and carried the cars on their
backs,
n s e a

After all, I strongly suspect that
Kuncl is laughing up his sleeve as
strongly if not more strongly than all
the rest of us. It it a citizen’s pr!»
rogative to laugh at his congress, and
the rest of us, It is a Citizen’s pre—
vogative to laugh at his congress, and
a president's prerogative to laugh at
the citizens and the congress.

Princeton Seniors Revive
Old Undergraduate Custom

PRINCETON, N. .l. (ACP)~The
oldest undergraduate tradition at
Princeton university was revived here
recently when seniors sang once again
on the steps of Nassau Hall.

Each evening at the ringing of the
curfew in the belfry of Nassau Hall,
the seniors. Wearing their white beer
suits, stroll across the campus to the
steps to sing. The custom was begun
in 1760, almost twenty years before
the American Revolution.

The music has mirrored the trends
of the times. and the type of songs
has Changed considerably since the
Calonlal days, when sentimental songs
were in Vogue. After the.Civil War,
patriotic songs were sung. This year
a depression song heads the list, en.
titled "Where do we go from here,
boys?"

Mrs. E, E. Fike of Sterling, 111., is
visiting her son, Bradford Fike ’36,
here this weekend.

German Scholar Attempts
Duel at Lafayette College

EASTON, Pa. (ACP)~The old Ger.
man custom of duclling was almost
revived at Lafayette college recently
when a Gemieitchonge student and
a fellow at Lafayette‘took exceptions
to the portrayal of a skit on the Ger.
man situation in which George E.
Morris Allen, a senior, took the part
of Adolt Hitler.

After watching the presentation of
a college revue in which the skit was
a part, Gunther Kiel-sch, the German,
called Allen into a college office, slap.
ped him and challenged him to a duel.
Allen turned the situation from the
serious to the ludicrous, when as the
challenged party, with the privilege of
selecting weapons, he informed the
German that he was not adept in the
use of the pistol or sword but would
meet him in a boxing bout or a wrest.
ling match. ’

Called before college oflicials, the
two men threshed out the entire mat—
ter, with the result that Kiersch has
written a letter of apology to Allen.
