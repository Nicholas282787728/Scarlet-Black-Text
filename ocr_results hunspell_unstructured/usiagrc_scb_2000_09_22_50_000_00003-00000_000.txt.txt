This weekend, a number of students in
the newlyrformed Students for Ralph Nader
organizarion are traveling ro the Minneapolis
Targer Center to hear Nader and others speak at a
Green Party Rally. .

“It's probably going to be the largest
[rally] in the Midwest for Nader," group leader
Shannon Anderson ’01
said.

The Grinnell
Students for Ralph Nader
will be assisring rhc evcnr
rhrough ushering and
hclping with the ancsota
Green Parry.

“It a rally trying
to gcr pcoplc motivated and
:xcﬂcd so they will go back
and do volunteering and
campaigning to give thc
campaign some mom:mum in the Midwest,"
Anderson continued.

His supporters say that Americans feel
that Nader is a sensible alternative to the bipartisan
candidates ofthis year’s presidential election.

"I think rhar the fact that there’s going to
be a sellout audience ar rhe Target center speaks
the fact that there are very enrhusiasric Americans
out there that want a different opinion,” Matthew
Blake ’04 said. '

In addition to working at this weekend's
rally, students for Ralph Nader have many plans
to increase awareness, including writing letters to
editors or various media sources, campaigning in
and around the Grinnell area, and setting up a

didate.”

paraphernalia.

“We want the media to try that, when
they cover presidential polirics, to cover all the
candidates and notjust Bush and Gore," Anderson
said. “It's really biased towards rhe two parry system
right now, which makes it Very difficult for a third-‘
party candidate to be active and involved.”

. Future plans for the Nader campaign
include tabling in the post ofﬁce
next Tuesday to collecr signatures
for a petition to get Nader in the
presidential debates.

This Monday, the
Debating Union will debate
whether or not a vote for Ralph
Nader is a vote {or George w.
Bush. The organization hopes
that these activities will increase
awareness of Ralph Nader's
political views.

“A lot or people know rhar
Ralph Nader is an environmentalist, bur not very
many people know rhar he’s in favor of a
moratorium on the death penalty and. .orher good
progressive issues." Anderson said.

Overall, the Students for Ralph Nader
express much enthusiasm about the campaign and
upcoming election, and feel that Nader is an
excellent candidate for the President ofthe United
States. ‘

"People want a politician rhar will truly
present a left»wing view on issues, and will truly
present an antlrcorporate, proworking class view
of the issues." said Blake. “That is what Ralph
Nader otters as a third.parry candidate."
