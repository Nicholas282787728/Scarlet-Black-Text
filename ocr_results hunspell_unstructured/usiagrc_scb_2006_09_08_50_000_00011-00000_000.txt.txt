Gridders drop season opener, 57-31

av CHRISTENA MCINTYRE AND PATRICK RITTER

Pioneer linebacker Bren Maloney 09 knows that when a
football teams offense scores 31 points. they should win the
game. But an explosive Kenyon College offense racked tip 563
yards last Saturdayat Rosenbloom Field to outgun the Pioneers
57~3 l.

“The [Kenyon] quarterback and rrrrinrng back were excep-
tional athletes," said Grinnell defensive coordinator Tim Hol—
libaugh, adding that it was hard to replicate that athleticism
while preparing for the game.

The Lords from Gambier, Ohio pounded our 333 yards on
the ground on the way to posting their highest point total since
1909.

For the Pioneers, wide receiver l<yie Perry '03 hauled in
nine catches for 114 yards and a touchdown Ben Remington
'08 had sit receptions for 76 yards and two scores, and Nick
Mcrklin '08 chipped in insane and 54 yards on six receptions.

Qiarterback Sean Pfalzer ’07 ﬁnished 26-36 passing for
339 yards and five touchdowns, led the team with 75 yards on
14 rushcs, and averaged 43.5 yards on four punts.

On the other side nfthe ball, the Grinnell College defense
used a new alignment that is not commonly seen in college
football. The 3,5,3 formation uses five linebackers. and it “1,
lows the Pioneers to get more of their deep linebacking corps
on the field at one time to blitz and cover.

One of those linebackers on Saturday was Maloney, who
frnished with a gamerhrgh 15 tackles in his first game back
from a knee injury that ended his season prematurely last year.
Another was John Hereford ’10, who recorded 14 tackles and
a sack in his collegiate debut to provide a bright spot for the
future of the Pioneers defense.

"We all expected him to do well," Maloney said. “In prac-
tice, he looked like he was already playing at college level, and
itwas good to see him~take that into the game."

Holllbaugh praised another frrst year, free safety Ryan
Boehm '10 from lowa City's storied City High football pmr
gram, “He really ﬂew around out there," the defensive coordir
nator said ofthe 5’9", 180epounder who recorded six tackles.

Many other new faces joined Bohm in playing signifrcant
minutes. Offensive linemen Michael Tricoli and Christopher
Chavez and defensive back Fernando Jenkins were among
those who were adjusting to the speed ofthe college game the
hard way—by playing big minutes in their ﬁrst game within
‘three weeks ofarriving on campus for football camp.

Maloney said the Kenyon game was a chance to work our
some jitters before the conference season begins, especially for
those young players. But that learning process can hurt a team
on the freld. as young players who are mistake-prone are forced

into signiﬁcant playing time early' rn their careers.

"Youth and inexperience. are really hurting us Hollibaugh
said

Looking forward to the conference season, Hollibaugh said
that the offense is good enough to win games ifthe defense
can step up.

Helping coach that defense is student assistant Nate “Grizz‘
Lindsey '09, whose back injuries crrt short his playing career
last year. Maloney said the former team co-defensive fresh-
man of the year is the “heart and sonl“of the Pioneer defense,
and Hollibaugh described him as a bridge between players and

coaches.

“Because he's played under us, he understands whar we
want to do as coaches," Hollibaugh said. “But he still has a lot
of player in him, which gives him a great perspective.”

The Pioneers begin the conference season tomorrow when
they will travel to De Pere, Wiseonsin'to take on St. Norbert.
The perennial powerhouse Green Knights were ranked second
in the conference in the preseason coaches poll and received
four fast-place votes. The game can be heard on AM 1410-
KGRN at 1:30 pm.
