GRINNELL was.

Deleated lowa atte’r a close Gan-io—
Scores-r.

A small crowd journeyed torth
to Ward ﬁeld Thursday afternoon
to witness which proved to be
the most exciting contest played
here this season. Johnny Vos
boys were defeated after a hard
struggle or to innings by the
wearers of the scarlet and black

Swalm was on the rubber for
the locals and Vos for tllevisltors
Both pitchers had peltect contrr-l
although Vos had the better of
the argument in regard to strike
outs. This may be accounted
form the [act that S. U l. is the
heaviest batting team in tllc
league, while Grillncll, with lew
exceptions is weak in that de-
partment.

The game started off \\el| both
sides being retired without a some
until the seventh. S. U. I. hit
sivalni repeatedly but by peitect
support were prevented from
scoring until the eighth,

lnthe seventh. Swallum made
a lwo-bagger, Schilling tollowed
with a short inﬁeld hit, reaching
ﬁrst, but toreing Swallum out at
third. Wilder went out 0|) a
foul, then Filmore came to bat
and knocked out another two
bagger. scoring Schilling. This
ended the scoring tor this inning,
Gilchrist going OLIl‘On a grounder.

In the eighth, lowa. by a come
bination of sale hits, and by
errors on the part of Gilchrist
and Filmore made their only
score. Filnlore's error was caused
by slipping on the wet grass just
before he reached the ball, but.
Gilclirist's was unexctlsable.

No more scores were made un-
til the tenth. Iowa came to bat,
made their little stunts and sat
don-n again: In Grinnell‘s halt,
Gilchrist out. Bridgen
reached ﬁrst on error by Vos.
Benson then knocked an easy

struck

 

a wild throw to ﬁrst, Bridguu was
advanced to third. Marsh came
to bat and proved himself to be
equal to the emergency by
knocking a sale ,it just over
second, bringing in the winning

run
