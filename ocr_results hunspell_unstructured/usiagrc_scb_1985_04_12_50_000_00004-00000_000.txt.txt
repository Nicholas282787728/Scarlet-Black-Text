Improving the ‘Public Dialogue’

By Rebecca Weston

Une seldom encounters a discussion
that pertains to concepts. goals. and
underlying principles oi policies; in-
stead, one gets trapped in the complex-
ities of a speCliic issue, wrote a group
who will bring spokespeople [or two of
the nation's most extremely opposed'
lactions to campus next week to debate
the issues oi peace and war.

As part oi a national project. ‘lm-
proving the Public Dialogue on Peace
and Security On Campus.’ a group
drawn from both the college and town
communities will sponsor a debate

all United States intelligence agencies)

Mazzoli‘s proposed bill died in the
lastdays oi legislation in 1984. Although
similar bills had been passed in both the
Senate and me House (where it barely
squeaked by with a Vote of 216-2“). the
conferees where not able to reach
agreement in time to pass a combined
version of both bills.

The bill, which contained many com-
promises, sought to: 1) penalize
employers at illegal aliens; 2) create an
amnesty program which would have
granted permanent residence status to
aliens who illegally entered the country
prior to 1979 and temporary residence
status to those who gained entry bet
ween 1979 and 1931; and Si revamp an
existing program. making it possible
tor agricultural growers to lind ioreign
helpers on short notice under emergen-
cy conditions,

found

The discussion will be moderated by
Robert Piskus. President of the na-
tional WWWC,

Concerned about the polarization of
America into two opposing camps
tlhose who advocate peace through a
strong military and those who place
more emphasis on compromise and
negotiations) the WWWC has schedul-
ed public dialogues of this sort to take
place on five college campuses
throughout the country. said Professor
Joseph Wall. Chairman oi the Rosen-
iield Program.

in an attempt to find a rational solu-
tion to the "polarization of America"
and the answer to the whole question or
peace and peace activities. the wwwc

, is providing the opportunity to listen to

extreme positions expressed in a public
dialogue, Allowing for audience par-

ticipation. the WWWC aims to show‘

that common ground between the two
“opposing camps." Wall explained,

Both sides know nuclear war would
destroy the planet. both want peace.
and both want understanding, he add-
ed. '

Where such extreme positions are
taken. opinions will be voiced that will
conflict with those of the audience. The
“Public Dialogue” alluded to that pro-
blem when it wrote in its statement,
"Surely someuling is wrong when an
American Ambassador to the U.N. is

However, despite the compromises.
Congress was unable to negotiate
agreement on two final points on con-
tention v smte remibursement [or both
legalization costs and anti-bias provi-
sions.

The iirst controversy stemmed irom
a proposed program to create a (our-
year. state reimbursement program
totalling one billion dollars annually.
This program would alleviate state in-
curred costs due to legalization.
Although there had been original agree-
ment of the budgeted amount, the White
House later indicated that it would not
accept the provision.

The second dispute arose irom the
anti-bias provisions included in the
House version at the bill. Those provi—
sions called for the establishment of a
"special counsel" within the immigra-
tion board to deter and investigate any
discrimination arising from the bill.

shouted down when speaking on camv
pus." Wall also said. “We Cannot boo
llenry Rowen like Kirkpatrick was at
Berkeley."

Related to that problem. the "Public
Dialogue” is also concerned with the
locus and quality of campus political
debates. The “Public Dialogue" wrote.
"Even when competing perspectives
are heard in a campus debate, the
result Is more like a gavotte than a live-
ly search lor truth. The speakers posi»
tluns are wholly predictable. . . .Emo-
tional appeals are successful locus-
ing attention. but at a very high cost.
Passion and ignorance olten join
hands,"

The objective of this dialogue is to
remove the ignorance and encourage
real discussion. Wall said.

in order to identify his/her position.
each member of the audience is en-
couraged to {ill out the questionnaire on
peace and security issues prior to the
dialogue. Wall said (The questionnaire
will be available in the Scarlet and
Black and at the door oi Herrick
Chapel.) The results oi the question—
naire will be tabulated by the WWWC
and sent back to the college.

Wall also hopes interest will be
generated in town. He noted activities
at the Congregational and Episcopalian
churches as examples 0! the current
high level or concern about war ex-
pressed by the town community.

This clause. inserted in response to a
nationwide lobbying enort by Hispanic
and civil rights groups. was critized by
opponents of the groups that it would
make employers too susceptible to
discrimination suits.

Due to those heated controversies
and lack of time in the congressional
period. the immigration proposal was
killed in the House during the lame-
duck session of 1984.

Mazzeli and his supporters are cur-
rently gearing up (or another attempt
at passage oi the bill in Congress. The
contended issues remain the same.

The congressman's lecture on Thurs
day at 8:00 p.m. enlighted Grinnell
students as to changes in proposed
policies and will be discussed in further
detail in next week‘s issue.
