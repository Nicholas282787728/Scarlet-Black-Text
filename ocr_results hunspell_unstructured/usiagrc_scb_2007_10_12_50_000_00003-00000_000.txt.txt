Coming Out

start tackling more personal issues ...what it means to be an
ally and stand up and say ‘hey, why do you think that way?"

The forum on Monday with the International Student
Organization also offered students the op-
portunity to informally talk about their own
personal experiences. Students gave the ulr
dience several unique perspectives in com-
ing out, ranging from being openly queer
in Thailand to facing difﬁculties coming
out in Nepal. “1 think something like this
is really important because we have such a
high percentage ofinternatioual students at
Grinnell," said Melissa Rahman ’10, who 61?
tended the event.

Later in the week, students joined to—
gather and faced the cooling mltumn Weather to participate in
a new community art project based on mixed media. The goal
ot’the project was to express what coming out means as a con-r

munity

While many of these new events offered the opportunity to
bring all students together in support of the queer community.
both Duran and Franco agree that the larger
events, such as tho Harris drag show, attract
the most students. “With larger events, there’s
a lot ofinvolvement from people outside the
queer community,” Duran said. “Events that
take place in rhc SRC, people tend to shy
away from that"

Franco said that the drag show had be-
come the cornerstone of Coming Out Week
Erin Duran’09 (efforts to misc awareness. “it’s become a true

students."

that

This week's events are the ﬁrst of two weeks that the queer
groups sponsor each year, with the other being Pride Week in
second semester. Both increase awareness on campus ofissues
that will continue to be important for a long time. “we’ve done
some progress as u whole, in the last 20 years thcrc's been a lot
of progress," said Franco. “i feel like we've been so polarized
in the last two elections [But] the 18~35 voting group is
becoming very active and educated on the issues and how these
politicians are affecting them"

For Duran, the importance ofComing Out Week is much
closer to home. “A lot of people assume that since Grinnell is
more ofa liberal place that it is really queer friendly," she said.
“I think it's important that we show the campus that there is a
queer community and we are here ifanyone has difficulty com-
ing out or expressing their sexuality.

“We went to use the positivity ofthis week to fight some of
rho negativity generated by derogatory comments and ideas”
