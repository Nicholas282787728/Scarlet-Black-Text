to 3-11 in Midwest Conference

Grinnell also suffered two more losses
over the weekend to conference opponents
at home. The Pioneers fell to a strong Beloit
team 74-58 on Feb 7 following a 75740 loss to
Ripon (9-4, 12-8) the day before.

“Ripon and Beloit are two very differ-
ent teams, and we match up better against
E I 't " Gluekman said. “But we‘ve had two
really good games against
Beloit and in the second
halragainst Beloit we played
them even. But they have
some tremendous athletes
and they’re well-coached
and they use their assets re-

am that we were

high coming into the game. Mallo yScharf '11 allywell."

The Pioneers led by four at
the half but Knox (3-11 MWC, 6-15) tallied
backin the second half and kept it close. With
five seconds left and the game tied at 69, Knox
was able to make 2 free throws for the win,
“We came in thinking that we could at
least improve on what we did the last time
and we were tied in the league," said Mallory
Schatf’ll. “But it was definitely more disap-
pointing when we lost because we thought we
had a better chance ofwinning this one."
Despite the loss, the team had a couple of
excellent individual performances. Jess Shorts
'10 scoled 27 points to lead all scorers and
Meg Huey’il added a double-double with 11
points and 10 rebounds. Also, after a weekend
ofwhat Gluekman described as a “Irorriflc”te—
bounding performance, the Pioneers were able

The Pioneers came our
hard against Beloit (11-3, 14-7), leading 1677
with13z44 remalnlngin the ﬁrst half. But Be-
loit, which is currently second in the confer-
ence standings, came back and by the half, had
taken the lead,44-28,

“When we come out against Btloit like
the way we did it should give us a lot ofconﬁ-
denee,” Seharf said.

The Pioneers have lost six straight entering
this Saturday's game against Illinois College.
However, it is the Pioneers' last home game
and they hope to end the season on a good
note.

“We want to see some improvement since
the last time we played these two teams,”
Schal'fsaidf‘We want to show them that we’re
not the team thatwe were a month ago."

Tennis team ready to rock

or MAX CALENBERG

Last season the Grinnell men's tennis team
calne in 13th in the NCAA Division III (on?
nament.This season,with a wide range of goals
including earning a national ranking, winning
conference, sending team captains Dan La-
Fountaine '09 and Nate Fox ’09 to nationals as
doubles partners and Juan Carlos POW/.111 in
singles, they expect to do much better.

In September, the team went to the ITA
(Intercollegiate Tennis Association) Midwest
Regionnl tournament, where Coach Andy
Hamilton '85 was impressed by the play orsam
Raife’ll) and Eric thtcr'12,who both contins
lied to improve their game to win matches.

But it was Perez who stood out as he
reached the quarterﬁnals, losing to Gustavus
Adolphus senior John Kauss. the eventual
ITA Divisionlll National Singles Champion,
"That was [Perez] beginning to reach his po
tential," Hamilton said,

LaFountaine believes Perez's pelfotmance
inﬂuenced the whole team to strive for more,
"Watching him was a blast, even though we
were au sitting on the sidelines by that point."
LaFountaine Sﬂldtull really inspired all ofus,"

coach Hamilton has intentionally ar-
ranged a challenging schedule or non-contor-
ence matches against nationally ranked teams,
including Gustavus Adolphus (#3), washing
ton University (#1) and Kalamazoo (#28).

“We will probably trade some wins for
losses by taking this schedule," Hamilton said.
“But our players will be better prepared."

ln Midwest Conference play, where
Grinnell is a five time repeatingehnmpron,tlie
most challenging roe appears to be Lake Forr
est Collegeqvho ﬁnished second ill the h/HNC
last yeltt, and have all their starters returning.
The strong line-up of either LaFountaine or
Perez at number one singles, Fox ar number
three, Rittcr at number four and Raife playing
two should present a formidable opponent to
any adversary.

In preparing for the future, Hamilton is
placing two first-year players in key doubles
roles, as Dmitriy Glumov '11 will pair with
Raife for the number three doubles and Mars
tin Dluhos '12 joins Perez for the numbetrtwo
team.The number one doubles will be ﬁlled by
the proven duo of Fox and LaFountaine, who
aspire to reach Nationals,

After retleeting on last season, Pc at was
looking forward to watching the hrstryenrs
compete, knowing rull well the beneﬁts it
could have for their abilities.

“I matured so much," Perez said. "When I
played back home I had the talent but I would
always have mental breakdowns in the middle
of matches that kept me from winning"

Although the Pioneers have few home
matches this season, LaFuuntaine encourages
all to come out and watch.

“This season," LaFountaine said, “we haw:
the best player to come through our program
in Perez, the best doubles player ever in Nate
[Fox], and I'll give myselfthe title of best en-
tertainet."
