Cornell got away to a good start
\n'th eight points in the high hurdles,
but Grinnell cams back strong‘ in the
mile and the century dash, Paulu and
Smith getting ﬁrst and third respec-
tively in the 100 and Sechrist and
Reece repeating the process in the
mile. At one time Cornell led by a
count of twenty ﬁve to twelve. but
the Pioneers turned in enough points
in the ﬁeld events to turn the scale.
Daubenberger, Hicks and Her-riott
ﬁnished one. two, three in the shot.
‘ Minty and Richards ﬁnished togeth-
er in the half, being given ﬁrst and
second respectively. Gordon and Se-

shed ﬁrst and second. Eoehmler took
the pole vault, while Parker tied with
Renner for second place. Vinsel and
Herr-lot tied with two Cornell entries

recovered himself before Paulu got to
his feet and the lead was impossible
to cut down.

Meet limes Siltllullly.

The next m‘eet on the Pioneer sched—
ule is that'with Ames on the local
ﬁeld next Saturday. That the Cyclones
have an excellent squad is evidenced
by their showing at the Drake relays,
when they all but set a world's record
in the two mile, besides taking a ser
cond in the mile and a third in the
four mile. The Cyclones are also to
have some good men entered in the
ﬁeld events. and the meet should he
exceedingly close.

HISTURIGAL THEME IN
“SPIRITEGRINNEII.”

Pageant. Presents Founding And
Growth of School — To Be
Given May 22.

“The Spirit of Grinnell" is the title
of the May pageant which is to be pre—
sented under the direction of Miss Cla—
ra J. Anderson on the afternoon or
May 22, as a part of the May Festival.

The pageant will depict the history
oi Gr-innell since its rounding in 1m
The prescntation consists of ﬁve cpi-
sodas: 1. The prologue; 2. Dedication
of the Altar of Truth, and the going
forth of the Iowa Band 3. The Cyr
clone; 4. Gl'lnnell's par u the two
wars (1861 and 1017); 5. The hope
for her future secccss.

The ﬁrst scene is an Iowa pra ie
ruled, over by the Spirit of the Prai—
rie. Then is shown the coming of the
lndians, who are driven before the ear-
ly settlers. The Spirit of Education
enters and is followed by the Iowa
band, who erect an Altar to Truth.
The Cyclone destroys the altar and the
hopes of the Iowa hand, but they
arouse themselves and rebuild their
altar.

War, and his associates, Greed, Lust,
and Anarchy enter and attempt to put
out the ﬁre on the altar but the Spirit
of Grinnell protects it.

The Spirit of Grinncll realizes that
she cannot serve Humanity by keeping
her sons at the home altar, and she
bids them go forth to the ﬁght. Peace
is again victorious, and the group a—
round the altar rejoice in the hope of
Grinnell’s iuture. The Hope for Grin-
Dell‘s luture is expressed in a proces—
sional assisted by the Girls Glee Club.
The ﬁrst group represents Plenty, fol-
lowed by Prosperity, the Fruit Maid-
cns, and Gratitude, who pass by the
altar singing "The Spirit or Grillnell”.
The Priestesscs and the Spirit of Grin-
nell come last in the processional.

The leading parts will be taben by
Virginia Sweney, Frank Almy, Irenc
Loose, Gwendolyn Townsend, Chester
Falkenhaiuer, Joe Kelly, Frank Doro-
thy and John Egan.

IHIIDLEY ADVISES
REGGGNITIUN 0F
BGLSHEVIST GIJV.

U. S. Must Take Armen-
ian Mandate Now or
Stay Out Entirely.

“Although I am not in favor of Bol-
shevism, I believe that the only real
solution to the Russian situation is
the recognition of the Bolshevists gov—
ernment," declared Ed Hadley, ’16, re—
turned Armenian relief worker, in an
rntcrview Monday afternoon.

"There are only two alternatives.
to ﬁght it or to recognize it. If we
ﬁght it, with ﬁrmed force, an army of
5,000,000 men will be necessary. if
we draw a cordon around Russia,
which is really impractical, we shut
off the Russian resources which Eu»
rope so badly needs. an the other
hand, we can recognize it and let it
prove itself vby trial. It cannot be Suva
pressed by force for it has too strong
a footbald. The word Bolshevikl i
sell means majority as over against
the minority government led by Kev
ensky, which 1he Bolshevikl ovelu
threw. The Bulsheviki represented
the only organized power in Russia,
the chief factions bave allied them—
selves with it

Wmlt Recognition.

"The Soviet government desires a;
hove everything else. recognition by
foreign powers. On this account there
is a strong sentiment for a steady gov.
ernment. There are really very few,
killings.,now. and although as hte Eolc
Shevist army moves on and sets up
the Soviet government, it arouses a
great deal of bad feeling, there is lit~
tie violence, There was, in the days
of the revolution, in 1917 and early in
1918, a very real Reign of' Terror, but
that sort or thing has largely disap—
peared, Practically all Russia is or
has been at some time controlled by
the holsheviki. and there is no long—
er any fear of them.

"The Soviets and Bolsheviki are
of course, synonymous, and their gov<
ernmcnt is by trade communes. Liene
and Trotsky, the leaders, are best de<
scribed as opportunists. They antici—
pate the sentiment or the people and
make their policies accordingly, to
stay in power. I believe they are really
sincere. however and not governed by
private interests. 1 bclieve, if given a
trial, that Bolshevism ,rvill simmer it—
self down to a steady government not
very far in principle from our own.

Toke Mundane or stay Out.

”The Dolsheviki arc advancing now
in the Caucasus region. They are try—
ing to win over the Armenians for
thc Armenians were formerly under
Russian lnﬁuence. If the United
States does not tells a mandate over
Armenia very soon the Eolshevikl will
acquire it. Then if the United States
decides to go in, it would probably iu~
volve us in a war with the Eolshevikl
which we could hardly afford. If the
United Statee does not take the man—
date snon, we had better keep our
hands on and let France and England
do the best they can with the situation,
if we do not take the mandate, we
must take back all our talk of giving
the world a sure peace and admit that
we are not in a position to take any
responsibility in seeing that peace is
established.

Ii‘mncc Emu ‘Agnirrst Wilson. .

“Acceptance of the mandate would
or course necessitate member-ship in
the League. The territory included
under the mandate would probably be
Constantinople and Asia Minor. It
would involve the setting rrp of a
Turkish government worthy of the
name. The present Turkish govern—
ment has absolutely no power. The
Armenians are strongly in favor of A—
merica as the mandatory power. The
conservatories and radicals even unit—
ed in asking members or the relief
commission to bc'cornc President of the
Republic.

"The position of an American a—
broad is Very unpleasant just now. On
every side he is asked questions which
be cannot answer. Everyone wishes
to know why we do and do not do Cer—
tain things, Tlrcreis great loss of Sym-
pathy with the United States. France
is especially bitter against President
Wilson for his failure to obtain the
ratiﬁcation of the treaty. Franco
claims that the President misrepre
scntcd his power in the Peace Confer-
slice."
