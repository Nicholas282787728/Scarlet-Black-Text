- The British have a word for iF‘That'S not
cricket.” This is their way of expressing
disapproval of someone who isn’t playing
the game according to the rules.

This week the second student in the
dormitory system was suspended for riding
in a car. We have no complaint about this
action. It was only the logical move to make
after a clear infraction of the rules,

The rule applying to illegal use of cars
by Gyinnell students resulted after several
tragic auto accidents We believe the rule
to be justified. _

BUT this rule is not being enforced lm»
partially by the administration Flagrant
violations of this rule are well-known to
most of the students.

Why is it that certain students are allowv

know We have our ideas but we hesitate to
print them.

Perhaps the administration would be will-
ing to clear this matter up, both for ollr
benefit and for their peace of mind.

0 Syud Hossain Lectures.

There was a time perhaps when notice of
an impending lecture on the subject of
India would arouse ill the great mass of
college students no more associations than
perhaps visions of mystic snake charmers
or glamourously veiled women—the Masked
Mystery of the Orient.

For India to most of us we little more
than a romantic, fal‘»0ff, weird aiid alto,
gether out»ofvtlliseworld region, the land of
paradoxes, of Gandhi and starving millions
and of the Taj Mahal, of fabulous jewels
and incredible diseases, of involved Oriental
philosophy and of the most bigoted ignor—
ance,

Gone now, however, is this purely pic-
turesque conception of India, along with
summer dreams of South Sea paradise isles.
To even the lnost stubbornly romantic of
lls, the sad truth is daily thrust firmer into
our consciousness that this war is making
the world one close knit neighborhood, that
we cannot afford to consider ourselves cul»
turally, economically, politically, or socially
distinct from any other group or locality.
The fate of one may ultimately become the
fate of the rest; all are in alarming- degree
interdependent.

Dr, Syud Hossain will speak tonight on
late developments in India alid the near
East, We predict that his audience will be
attempting to integrate what he says into
a very concrete relationship with our own
crucial position. Nor will this be hard. India
is a very vital part of our world, and it is
no falsely stimulated interest we show in
our concern about her recent development
and her present course.

“Dibble would be used under

Stevens claimed that the Separ-

to orient themselves better, and
that they would then identify
themselves as members of the
freshman class and not as mem-
bers of anyspccific hall.

Kay Long's plea to all women in

that the full cooperation of every
citizen is needed to conserve ma-

States self-sufficient in its pro-
duction of clothing

Since the public will no longer
have free access to Nylon, pure
Wool garments, and certain colors
used by military forces, she cau-
tioned that college groups must
be willing to accept substitutes
for all these.

Miss Long foretold that sum~
