Spiritual paths to mental wellness

I write this lettei as a former youth pastor rind hospital
chaplain. Even more importantly, I wiite it as rhe Lilly intern
and a Grinnell alumnus with an immeasurable love for you and
this institution.

After reading the SEER articles about mental health, I was
saddened My fellow Grinnellians have access to county men-
tal health counselors, support groups, RLC’s, Health Center
staff, individual therapists and others to cope with mental
health issues, Yet, some Grinnellians seem to shy away from
religious/spiritual groups and tmined religious professionals. 1
encourage students, faculty, and staff to utilize the various spirit
tual resources the center for Religion, spirituality and Social
Justice (the Center) has to offer.

Explore spirituality. For some individuals, spirituality is
equated with organized religion, creeds, docrrine and specific
practices. For others, spirinialiry means feeling connected with
self, family friends and the greater community however one
chooses to define these entities.

1 encourage you to attend Shabbat services, Gumaa (Muss
l.im Friday prayers),lilack Church in Grinnell and the 20mins
ure Midweek Christian services in Herrick Chapel. Check out
the Christian Science
organization, Quaker
Silent meeti , Fellowe
ship or Christian Athe
letes and the Lutheran
Bible Study Consider
some of our students
led groups like Cathos
lic Student Association.
Buddhndhorma, Progressive Christians, Pagan Discussion Cir-
cle and Grinnell College Christian Fellowship among others.

I invite you to meditate in Herrick Chapel oi in the miilti»
religious prayer room in the Center.

lftlicse things are too “religious" for you, then connccr with
the human spirit at Community Meal ar Davis school on Tues-
days (shuttles leave the Center at 3:20 pm. and 4:30pm).Try
drumming with me at the Drum Circle. Come be consoled Jnd
console others who are giieving the loss ofloved ones at “LiVA

ing with Loss" on Wednesdays at 4:15. Perhaps, you may want
to develop a relationship with some of our senior citizens in
town

If you need something more personal, walk the labyrinth
when it is set up in South Lounge. Better yet, make an appoint-
ment to visit With Rev. Deanna Shorb, Rabbi Dilveen Lirwin
or me. Feel free to drop by the office. we have walk»in hours
on Mondays, Wedness
days and Thursdays,
My colleagues and l
are available to explore
personal, emotional.
spiritual and/or religious
issues regardless of race,
creed, sexual orientation,
age. gender, national and
ethnic origin, marital
status and disability. You
can meet us here or somewhere elsesYou can talk about religion
with us or choose to ignore it. We just want you to feel a sense
or connection and belonging. We have been ordained by our
religious communities in part for this reason.

The exploration of spirituality is a valid means of dealing
with mental health issues, just as valid as seeing a “seculai” pro-
fessional. For those who say that religion hiis been detrimental
and irrelevant,l hear you. 1 have been hurt by fellow Christians
in the name oflesus Christ. Yet, for me, there ale redeeming
qualities within my own religion that feed my spirituality and
benefit me mentally, Having said this, 1 urge the college com-
munity not to dismiss religion oi spirituality. After all, humans
are ﬂawed individuals and so too are out “sncied” rind “secular"
institutionsTo be fully human, one does need to feel connected
to something. Hence,l invne you to exploie your spirituality.

Explore spirituality. Explore youi own spiiinlaliry, Take it
from your fellow Grinnellian who knows what it is like to live
and lenin on this cainpus.Tiust me; this is the perfect time in
your life to undergo sueh an exploration.

You are in my prayers and thoughts daily
