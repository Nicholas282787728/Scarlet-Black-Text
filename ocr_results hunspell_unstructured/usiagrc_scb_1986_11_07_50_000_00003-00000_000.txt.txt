tie at [ceding the press misinformation so
as to scare Qadaffi into believing the us,
planned to attack him

First. Coon does not approve of the prac-
tice ol deliberately misinforming the
press. He said that he did not know
whether there has been. Indeed, a “mis
step” in this case. but “|f their has been. it
was speedily corrected.

“There are many grey areas in

The Faculty discussed possible changes in the school’s admission
policy at their meeting last Monday, Photo by Stephen Hardwick.

Admission

meeting stemmed Irom the ranking of the
projected contribution above standardized
test results It was suggested by several
faculty members that in the past the Ada
missions Board tended to place a higher
value on the standardized test scores of an
applicant than his or her projected con~
tribution to the college community. This
view was confirmed by Grey although he

from page 1

added that in the admissions process for
the fall semester 1986, standardized test
scores were largely not considered.

The meeting concluded withouta vote on
the proposal, Further discussion and cons
sideration Will be given to the new admis-
