more important events of the

week. and was attended by a large
audience.

As a whole, the program
one of unusual excellence, and re
ilects great Credit on the young
people who took part, as well as
on their instructors. The selec-
tion from Cicero's “Pro Atchial’o-
eta," by Mr. Deiavan. and the di-
aloguc from Plato, given by the
Messrs. Gannaway and Swan,
showed how successfully the the
ory of infusing into the dry bones
of the dead languages the lite and
energy of living thought and
speech has been put into practice
The three young men entered
thoroughly into the spirit ot the
characters, and although there
were few in the audience who
were able to understand all that
they said, the numbers were very
well received.

The modern languages were
represented by two selectionsi
a recitation from Moliére’s “Bours
geois Gentilhomme," by Miss
Carrie Denise. and “Der Drilte,"
a German comedy, by Bendix.
Parts were taken by K. E. El-
dridge. representing the Philolo-
gian society, the Misses Marie
Bousquet, Matic Paul and Olive
Wilson. The comedy was well
acted, the costumes tasty, and the
ability with which the language
was rendered was a pleasant sure
prise to all.

The oration entitled “The
Struggle cf the Islands."by R. D.
Cruikshank, representing the Lew-
is Literary Society. was a strong
and earnest plea for Ctr/7a Lib-z.
The class oration, by Guy E. Sni»
der, was a burlesque on the self-
laudation, ﬁowcry oratory, and
poetryrquoting of tilt: conven-
tionalt graduating oration. Mr.
Owen's story, “Colonel Guncan~
non’s Capitulation. was well writ-
ten, and showed a constructive
and creative imagination, which
should, with training, enable him
to do some of the best literary
work Iowa College has produced.

The Elizabeth Barrett Brown-
ing Society was represented by a
well-chosen recitation, “Saint
George and the Dragon," by Miss
Mabel Miller. The vocal num-
bers,-a solo, “The Maiden and
