Beer honorarium passed

by Anne Rawland

A one minute recess at Wed
nesday night’s Joint Board
meeting resulted in the awarding
of a 8100 honorarium to Langan
Hall President Paul Sutton for the
purpose of purchasing three kegs
oibeer for tomorrow night’s James
Gang Bang. 7

Prior to the vote, Cornell Rudov.
represenmtive of Rawson, called
for a one minute recess during
which cabinet members were
asked to leave the room.

RUDOV PROCEEDED to sug-
gest to the members present
the need tor the honorarium,
saying the money could be spent
ior “something that cosB $32.00
and Could be used this weekend,”

The James Gang Bang will be
held tomorrow night, and kegs cost
about $32.00.

“If the money is spent." SGA
President Greg Youtz, “it would be
a direct violation of the alcohol
policy by an agency ot the SGA and

a violation of state law," ,
RUDOV SAID LATER that his

purpose was “to create a
situation where the liability to the
college will be reduced."

SGA Treasurer Wes Kennedy said
Thursday night he had no power to
stop payment of the honorarium
but would do everything he could to
convince Ginny Rose, student
auditor. that she should not sign
the check.

TllE JAMES GANG Bang itself
was a topic of discussion at die
meeting. Rachel Malina, James
Hall coordinator, presented to
Joint Board a budget for the
coming event, Her ' ‘
estimates for prizes, decorations,
etc. totaled $1268.00, but she made
a plea asking to have ceiling set at
31500, ior “unexpected costs".

 

In light of the [act Joint Board
allocated Loose Hall $1500 for
their all campus event, the revs
decided to grant her requat.

THE REASON TllE money
wasn’t just given to the hall as it
was to Loose, said Kennedy, was,
“because we wanted the hall to
come to us with a Specific budget,
When we gave Loose the money
they spent right up to the limit
without making tight budgeting
plans,

“In planning the budget for this
semester we had hoped to iorce the
group to be more accountable with
SGA funds. I have some real cone
cems about allocating the extra-
money when Joint Board doesn’t
even know where it's going."

MALINA I’ROMISED THE
group if the money wasn’t needed
it would not be spent.

SGA also approved a budgct for
second semester in a 19272 roll call
vote, after adding several amr
mendments,-.

FUNDS FOR THE Grinnell Book
captured the greatest share of
discussion when the group
requested a sum of $1500 for ex
penses,

Originally. no money was
budgeted for the book, but Dan
Flynn, representing the yearbook,
said that they were having trouble
with [unding this year due largely
to the inferior quality of the book
last year.

AFTER MORE THAN an hour of
discussion Rudov moved that the
group be budgeted $500 to. go
toward their first payment due to
the publishers on April 1. The move
also called for Joint Board to
consider giving the book more
money at that time, when its
financial situation would be more
definite.

RUDOV ALSO MOVED to
transfer $700 from the General
Budget to Hall i'unds. Kennedy
said, however, all but five halls had
carryrover funds from last
semester.

Harvey Left, representing the
finance committee. said the
committee ieit the money would
benefit more people on campus ii
the [unds were left in the General
Budget.

Fritz Maytag. chairman of the
Board of Trustees. said this week.
he would like Grinnell College’s
next president to be a f‘SupeP
man." '

The model president should be
familiar with the ”world of
academia,” and have “an
academic respect for a small,
liberal artscollege,” Maytag said.
He would like to see~that apprec-
iation gained through experience
at a liberal‘arts college, whether as
a student. as a member of the
faculty. or as an administrator.

The new president must also be
able to “relate well with the
faculty.” He or she must also be a
good administrator and have the
necessary administrative skills,
, Maytag said. ‘

' Maytag also said he is anxious to
get started on the search for a new
president, and dislikes the idea of a

,“long, drawn-out search.” “I’m
eager to get started,” he stated.
adding he would like to see all
members of the campus comm<
unity participate in the search
procedure, from students to
faculty to alumni.

Turner rejects CSL
co-ed bathroom policy

by Dan Flynn

President A Richard Turner
announced Monday he would velo
the CSL- and SGA-approved
revision oi campus bathroom
policy, said SGA president Greg
Youtz

Reacting to Turner's decision,
Youtz said he was disappointed
and dismayed He said he felt
Turner should not have ignored
such a strong and united student
voice.

"THE DECISION causes me
increased cynicism. We are sup-
posed to be largely selirgoverning.
The resolution was overwhelming
1y supported by both the CSL and
Joint Board, which are the
student's governing bodies. Then
Turner uses the emergency
escape," Youtz said,

The policy. making dial-a-john
the most restrictive option
available on co—ed floors with only
one bathroom, had been passed by
CSL in late November, and “over-
whelmingly" endorsed shortly
thereaiter by the Joint Board.

AT THAT TIME Youtz ex-
pressed hope that die policy would

revealed his fear that the proposal
would cause difficulties \vlth ins
coming freshmen.

llE SAID IN the memo the school
will not have enough housing
spaces to hold freshmen who
request housing on a door that
guarantees a SingleVseX bathroom,
and that some students will not
come to Grinnell because of the
situation.

“I personally feel it is absurd
that even one student who wished
to attend Grinnell College would
end up not doing so because he or
She could not live in a hall where
there is a single sex bathroom,"
Tederman wrote.

TEDERMAN'S HESITATIDN,
however, did nothing to change the
opinions of committee members.
The proposal then went to the Joint
Board, where it passed by a wide
margin.

Late last semester. the proposal
went to Turner. Tcderlnan again
presented his objections, and
Youtz represented the fedings or
SGA and CSL members. At that
time it was decided to hold the

supported by CSL and SGA

But Dean of Student Atfairs Jim
Tederman felt the policy would
cause more problems than it would
solve. In a memo to CSL members
after the committee had initially
approved the proposal, Tederman

Charles Bear has been liamed'as
its chairman. However, no other
appointments have been made,
and Maytag said the committee
will be ”small and broadly based."

The Search committee-will meet
with both faculty and students, but
Maytag is not sure what selection
procedure will be followed. He said
it “might or might not be” similar
to the one used in 1974. He has
already discussed the meeting with
Ron Kurtz, chairman of the
faculty, and is anticipating a
similar meeting with a student
group, should one be formed. The
faculty will, discuss the issue at' a
meeting on Monday.

Maytag said that the type of
president selected 'will be deter-
mined by the entire college

'community. “it all depends on the

college and what it sees its’future
to be," he said.

Trustee Thomas Hutchison
echoed this Sentiment. “Every-
body will have an opportunity to
give their best thoughts as to the
kind of person we are looking for,”
he said. Hutchison, and other
trustees questioned refused to ela~
borate on what a perfect college
president should be, preferrin ’ to

missions John Hopkins would be
brought in to provide insights on
problems the policy would cause
the lreshman.

HOPKINS AGREED WITH
Tederman that the policy would
discourage some freshmen from
enrolling and added it would cause
his department headaches ex-
plaining the policy to parents.
Youtz said he was convinced that
the administrators had not brieied
Hopkins before the meeting.

In an 5&5 interview, Hopkins
elaborated on his views concerning
the situation, ”Grinnell has
basically a very liberal dorm
policy. Parents oiten express

‘ concern about the situation. . . I’d
I hate to see an able kid turned otf to
Grinnell because of the bathroom

policy. Anyway, the problem will

renovations—we’ve lived this long
with it so why Change now?" he
said,

YOUTZ RESPONDED T0
Tederman in a memo he sent to
CSL. “I sincerely doubt whether
any student‘s decision to attend
Grinnell would be more than
marginally (atmost) inﬂuenced by
. . . (the policy). If you stop to
consider the proposition,
you must realize that it is absurd.

; Do you not share your bathroom at

home with your family. some oi
whom are members of the opposite
sex? This certainly does not stop

‘me from going home for breaks!”

OTHER COMMITTEE members
did not react so strongly. Liahna
Babener, faculty representative to
the CSL, said she had mixed Views
on the resolution and wasn’t sur-
prised Turner vetoed it.-
