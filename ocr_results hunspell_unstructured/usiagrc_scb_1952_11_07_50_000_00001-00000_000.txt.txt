Harold Clapn (modem for
eign language) gave the lad-
dreSs on “How Scholarly Can
We Get?”

Clapp applied the “scholar-
ship situation” very closely to
Grinnell. He said that such
questions as the following
should be considered: Is the ins
tellectual climate satisfying and
stimulating? Are there too
many extra-curricular activi—
ties on Campus? Is the Honors
system challanging IS the big
wheel on campus better than
the brain who is sometimes re-
garded as a sour grape?

A rather unique system for
honors was suggested ethat
students would spend half of
their time in regular courses,
required to take exams but
free to take cuts. and the other
half of their time would be
spent in demanding indepenr
dent study with privileges such
as freedom to attend other
classes, to leave campus. and
extended library privileges,

the dean's list read by Dean
Max Fuller were:

For Horses of Distinction

The following editorial

An occasional nugget can he yicked up from the chitchat of
Sunday visitors, and it was in this fashion that we came to hear
of_the educational plans of a young lady who is to enter college
this fall. After canvassing the nation's institutions of higher edu-
cation, she decided upon Grinnell (and We quote our informant)
“because she can take her horse there.”

Apparently the mental attainments of the young lady are of
less moment than this ability of the horse to qualify with the
board of admissions. We do not know whether the horse was coir—
suited about his preference, but it was suggested that he may be
a Beta legacy and had heard that there was a strong chapter at

At the University of Kentucky the horse might have qualified
for a basketball scholarship, or he may have preferred a spell at
Karvard law so that he might rise later to the position of score-

Through his life he has taken
