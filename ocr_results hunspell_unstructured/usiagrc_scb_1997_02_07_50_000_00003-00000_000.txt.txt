Livmg 1n the real world: the dilemmas of off—campus housing

BY GEOFF SOLECK
Guest Writer

Ihad seen the state of the apartment
before I moved in. Plaster was fall-
ing off the ceiling directly above the
stove, the bathroom shower rocked
if you so much as bent over to wash
between your toes, and the founda»
tion leaned almost as much as the
tower in Pisa. It was our collective
theory that the only reason we did
not see more roaches was that they
were too busy holding up the walls
or their cherished breeding grounds.
I remember thinking, "What have I
gotten myself into?"

I feltenvious of the roaches for their
ability to live with such health haze
ards, but I naively comforted myself
with the assurance that my trusty
I a n d l a d y
would put
things right be
fore I moved in
(with the help
of a cleaning
service, and
recking crew,
miracles can be
accomplished).
However, on
the day I en-
tered the
house. I found
an entire role

’ of ﬁlthy paper
towles in the
trash. To my
surprise, my environmentally-con-
scious housemate admitted, “I was
just to trying to clean up some of this
511*" so I could use the oven."

I wondered, am I just a poor sod, or
do many college renters experience
the same honors? I've since found
more stories than I can share.

Alex Casillns ‘98, who lived in a
property managed by Ramsey
Weeks, Incv. alleged that his house
had not been properly maintained -

the walls needed painting, and some .

windows would not close or open.
According to Cassillas, when the ten
ants complained about a bathroom
sink which was literally coming off
the wall, the repairs were slow to
come.

Danny Carroll, an employee of
Ramsey Weeks, Inc., cemented, “I
do not recall the speciﬁc incident,"
and added, “Perhaps there was areae
sonable explaination...we do our
bes " Carroll laterelaborated. “That

Plaster was full—
ing off the
ceiling...and the
foundation
leaned almost as
much as the
tower in Pisa.

is deﬁnitely an older propcny,..0ne
of the reasons students call to rent
that properly early in the year is be
cause of it's character.”

Casillas explained, “I tried to go
with the more economical one, but
that still doesn’t mean it shouldn’t
meet codes.“

Carroll commented that to “do our
best", Ramsey Weeks. Inc. puts pins
tic on the windows from December
to March to help with hearing, but
admitted also that not all houses have
plastic, and claimed that "not all
properties need it.”

Jonathan Shearer '96 said that while
most of the storm windows in his
Ramsey Weeks, Inc. managed prop-
erty were put in by December, there
were still windows missing; one win
dow was allegedly added in
Feburary. Shearer described the in-
sulation as “me»
diocre", and
added that lus gas
bill since Novemr
ber had been over
$300 a month, dcr
spite keeping the
thermostat “quite
low" at around 62
degrees.

Shearer con-
cluded, “The
main problem
with the house is
its old. it’s drafly,
there’s not a lot
you can do."

If a house is sulfciently lacking in
heating, Chapter 562A.23 of the
Iowa Housing Code speciﬁes the
rights of a tenant to procure heat or
other essential services, If there are
actions students can take, why do
tenants not report legitimatemismanr
agement complaints?

Casillas answered,”IfI would have
been living there for a longer time, I

, would have cumplained...l didn‘t

even think about it I guess," Al-
though retaliatory conduct by a land-
lord is prohibited (chapter 562A.36
of Iowa Code), students may also be
afraid of creating any added difﬁculr
ties with their landlord if they come
plain.

If that landlord is a college admin-
istrator, such as Kathy "rind-all, the
fear of retaliation might keep tenants
especially silent. Students who have
lived in Tindall's properties in the
past are still reluctant to be publically
identiﬁed, even when proclaiming.

“I wouldn‘t rent from her again."
Some alleged that complaining as a
tenant could make dealing with her
“nasty”. No tenants who are cur-
rently residents of Tindall's proper-
ties have gone public with any coma
plaints.

Students who have rented Tindall
properties before this year havc ale
lcged they are inproperly maintained

and managed; for example, they are
not energy effec'ient, are infested
with insects and have peeling paint,
In addition, Tindall is also said to
have openly expressed reluctance to
rent to men or international students,

The Tindalls were unavailable for
speciﬁc comment, but they issued the
following statement in response to
reports that Lhcre werc student ten-

 

9%”

 

Many students in oﬁ‘rcampus housing endure poor living
conditions like those illustrated by this lamp, which is
nearly falling out of one student ’5 apartment ceiling.
Peeling paint is also a common student tenant complaint.

ants unhappy with their services:
“For nearly a decade we have rented
apartments to literally hundreds of
students. During that time, we have
continually strived to make improve
ments to our properties in an effort
to provrdc decent off-campus hous-
ing for students. We do our best to
make certain that important repairs
are completed in
a reasonable time
and that anything
of an emergency
nature is taken
care of immedir
ately. We have
received very
few complaints
over the years
and a great deal
of positive feed
back. We are
naturally cone
cerned that there
are a few tenants
who have com-
plaints and en-
courage lhem to
pursue any con-
cerns directly
with us. We are
committed to maintaining a good rce
lattonship with our tenants and we
will continue to work toward this
goa ."

A student did comment, “They have
done good things, but some things
they just don‘t act on...Jusl a lot of
things like [the allegations made
above]."

one feared that without the proper
pictures to prove mismanagement, a
landlord might keep a deposit, even

“Ifelt

cause we were
college stu-
dents, our land—
lord assumed
that we as ten-
ants would be

irresponsible.”
,. Sarah Cornell ‘97

though Iowa Code 562A.12 specifies
many conditions which restrict a
landlord's right to withhold depos-
its.

Sarah Cornell ‘97 expressed a come
mon concern among renters when
she said, ”I felt like because we were
college students, [out landlord] as-
sumed that We as tenants would be
irresponsible.”

“Don‘t let
them abuse you
beause you’re a
college stu-
dent," warned

vised, “make
sure you read

tract]." He
added, "When

there‘s any kind
of damage

there you might
want to point it
out to the

maybe document it [ie. with a calm
era with the date specified]...be a
smart consumer,"

Students might also be advised to
check out alandlcrd‘s history, past
and current, before renting a prop

Home sweet home

BY Eitm HUSTIINGS

In a town full of large, picturesque
houses, it may surprise many
Grinnellians to discover the squalor
in which students often live. There
is, however, hope for potential future
tenants. A number of students have
taken advantage of reasonable rent
prices and managed to find comfortr
able, attractive apartments in Grinr
nell.

Huge open rooms, molded ceilings,
and a chandelier give Rachel Unruh,
Josh Tobiesson, and Michele Host’s
apartment an elegant character. “We

all appreciate the fact that in the real
world, we’ll never be able to afford
another place this nice," Host said.
The thrcc bedroom apanment’s front
room is so strikingly spacious that
the residents have been using it as
an alternative gallery for student art.

The students say they are very sal-
isﬁed with their landlord, Norma
Roserithall. “Nothing ever breaks,"
Tobiesson commented, “but if any-
thing goes wrong, she‘s here right
away.“

Tobiesson, ﬂesh and Unruh said
they consider themselves lucky to
have found an apartment as comfort:
able and as well kept up as theirs.

 

So you want to live
off-campus?

Before they sign leases or have
dealings with landlords, Grinnell Stu~
dents hoping to live oﬂ’vcampus must
get approval from the StudentHous—
ing orhce. Problems have oecuncd
in past years due to there being an
overabundance of students wishing
to live in off-
campus housing.
New housing di~
rector Steve
Larson inherited
a non—college
owned housing
sysmm that will
likely continue
to be a source of
controversy.

When quesA
tioned about the
housing issue
that arose last
spring when a
number of junr
iors were turned down in their re—
quest to live offecampus, Larson de-
scribed the problem as arising ﬁom
the fact that the junior class was an
extremely large class. “We have a set
number ofpeople we can let on cattle
pus," Larson explained, He estimated
the number of students allowed off
campus at one hundred and eighty
with slight variations year to year.

honestly, if it costs you a little extra
money you can fix it yourself."

Ask Iggy!—

Hello there. Welcome back to Ask
Iggy. Where have you been? I
missed you, Anyway I am currently
in the process of diversifying this
column. But, alas, I don’t know how
much space I have so it is a bit difﬁa
cult because I hear that diversity
needs space. And nobody knows
what it best for diversity other than
diversity right? Here is a token die
versity effort on my part (token efr
fons: good tries or half~hearted ate
tempts at appeasement? You decide).
This week‘s interior decorating tip is:
if you hang that poster of whatever
you happen to have a poster ofa little
lower on your walls your anacepttc
cubicle of a room will seem bigger.
Someone told me Martha Stewart
said that but I disagreed because
Martha Stewart would never refer to
an “anaccptic cubicle" as a “room"
(a neomodcm efﬁciency chalet per—
haps but not a “room"). Ok. so if
you thought that tip was a little poor
or if you have some other tips or
questions or commentaries then send
them to me. Let the letters kcep roll-
ing in lo box 1044 or email Perillo
by next Tuesday. You better send

- those letters quick because my cola

umn may soon be ﬁlled by my Mom
who said she would start sending me
letters. On to this week‘s mail:

Dear Igg '.

’ All my friends makc run ofmy wardr

robe , of how small and unrstylish it
is. I think I need a few pointers, since
this has really been disrupting my
social life. Any tips on how I could
spice it up?

-Slovcnly Social Outcast

Slovcnly,You don’t happen to be
from Hawaii do you? Well, never

mind about that. The best advtce I
can give you is to incorporate more
shiny or sparkly things in your warde
robe. You don't even need to pur
chase anything, you probably could
accomplish this with things which
are near by. Some aluminum roll or
plastic wrap draped or tied around
your body is guaranteed to catch
many a eye. Or, glitter sprinkled
generously on your body is a safe bet,
If you're on a budget, don‘t underes-
timate the sparkly nature of sand .
sometimes you can find some on the
sidewalks although not very often
because many people remove it to

wear on their clothing.

Dear Iggy:
AACH! I need your help! Last see
mesler, I sent several “secret adr
mircr" poems and ﬂowers to a core
lain someone on campus, and now
I’m not sure in what manner to re-
veal my identity. The woman I sent
them to is intriguing and somewhat
intimidating. How can lpossibly let
on it was me? Suggcsdons, please.
—From the stealthy but still
obvious girl
Obvious,
Well, alot of this depends on your
personality. You could talk with her
alone or maybe a dinner With her
some other friends would be a good
time to reveal your identity. If you
are super lame then just tell ii few
friends and she'll know soon enough.
Do what you are comfcnaible with,
unless you like to make people uric
comrortablc. In that case a large cone
lession written with chalk on an oh-
vious sidewalk location would be
ideal. Good luck. Keep us posted
as to your progress.

They believe there are other rental
properties in Grinnell as nice as
theirs, but that few have as much
character. "I can come home," Host
said, “and feel like I'm in New York,
not Iowa."

Melissa Hess and Dariya Lcebaw
also have an apartment that breaks
the off—campus housing mold. With
homey decor including wallpaper
and recently redone wood ﬂoors,
Hess and Leebaw’s dwelling feels
more like a home than many student
apartments.

The two students also rent from
Norma Rosenthall, and have only
praise for their landlord, “When we
call and something needs to be fixed,

Mr. Rosenthall comes right away, the
day we ask,” Hess said.

Leebaw and Hess said they think
there are plenty of good apartments
available to students in Grinnell, but
said that small things like an abun—
dance of windows make their abode
especially inviting,

In contrast to the honor stories, a
number of students have had posi-
tive experiences ﬁnding off—campus
housing, but renters agreed that to
find the choicest apartments,
Grinnellians need to act quickly. “If
you know where to look, and you get
on it," Hess advised, “you can ﬁnd a
great place."
