Cops on campus,
students concemed

rivAltI ANISFELD BL DAVID LOGAN

Three weeks ago, at least four Grinnell
students were arrested on and off campus for
variorrs alcohol related charges. Police ptcst
enceiboth on and offcampusﬁis a common
anxiety for students,who often are unaware of
how to interact with law enforcement ofﬁcials,
and rumors about the recent arrests have only
increased that unease.

In the midst ofa perceived uptick in police
activity, ACE Securityitl-le student run orgat
nization responsible for basic safety and seem
rity at alltcampus events such as Harris parties
and COnCenS’Ol'ganlzed two campustwide
discussions to educate students about their
rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis law en-
forcement agencies, as well as the iole Campus
security and ACE security play on campus.

The events included a ﬁreside chat held on
Tuesday at which SGA President Neo Motake
’09 spoke about safety on campus. ACE Secut
riry ectDirectot Ben Howort '09 also ﬁelded
questions on the role ofACE Security.

On Thursday, Howort hosted an informa-
tion session about how to actwhen encounter-
ing police officersThc event began with open-
ing remarks by Director of campus security
Stephen Btiscoe. Afterward, Hewett ﬁelded
student questions on issues ranging from when
police can enter dorms to their legal rights to
gatdrng warrants and evidence usage

“I would love for people to be more ll‘r
formed about thcii rights in terms of inter»
acting with police,” l—lorvort said. “The other
thing I’d like to sec change, and this goes for
the whole student body, is that I'd love to see
more alcohol related education and a shift in
the alcohol culture here.”

Some students who have recently inter-
acted with Grinncll police said they felt that
Grinncll students were treated differently than

Series ‘of events commemotrates hate mail, builds awareness

BVARI ANYSFELD &HF.IDI CONNER

A year ago this week, on Feb 23, 2008, homophobic slurs
were scrawled outside a student’s dorm room and some of the
student’s propeity was vandalized. Ovei the couise of the next
ten days, 34 LGBTQstudents were sent anti-queei hate mail
and offensive and potentially threatening c—malls. After each
event, the campus community came together for rallies and a
forum, and well over 100 students chanted supportive cheers as
they marched from Main Hall to the JRC to proclaim both their
anger and their solidarity.

To remember the antitqueer acts and the supportive commut
nity response, and to continue the dialogue on issues of campus
inclusiveness, the Stonewall Resource Center (SRC), in collabo-
ration with other LGBTQgroups, has scheduled a number of
events that they hope will bring last year's acts into focus.

The series of events includcs an informal workshop taking
place today at which snidcnts will be able to apply ironton “Hate

Free" decals to clothing and backpacks, and a facilitated panel
discussion on Monday at which administrators and sociology
professors will answer questions about the overall community
impact ofthose kinds ofevents.Tlie events will wrap tip Tuesday
with a speaktout in Bob’s Underground where students can rct
ﬂcct and share their personal experiences with last year’s ctcnts,

According to SRC Program coordinator Brian rerbot ’09,
the programs aim to remind people about the magnitude of last
year's events and foster a continuing dialogue about Grinirell‘s
campus climate since the evontsﬁlt would be irresponsible ofus
to let this moment pass unacknowledged,"Perbix said.

Leah Krandel ’09. one ofthc organizers of the speak out, said
that the event will provide an opportunity for victims to share
their emotions, particularly friends of those who received letters,
a group that Krandel described as “secondary victims,"

“It’s a hard place to be in where you were upset, and you were
a secondary victim of what happened but your feelings weren’t

as legitimized because you didn't have a physical lettcr," Krandcl
said. “I needed support but so did all my fricnds"

Despite last year's outpouring ofsrrpport, marry stridcnts said
that the campus has a long way to go. According to Ryan carlino
'10, people in the Grirrrrcll LGBTQcommurrity are still cont
fronted by people insensitive to their sexuality.

“Grinnell is a great place to be openly gay compared to n lot
of schools,”Carl.ino said, “But people still do not feel comfortable
being pubhcly, openly out, or expressing affection toward their
paitner, it shows that there is still maybe some tension or things
going on campus [that do not support being gayl”

Kmirdel said she hopes that the weekwill increase dialogue on
campus regarding campus attitudes towards the LGBTQcomt
munity.“1'm going into this with the hope that we’ll give people
the opportunity to continued dialogue about this and encourage
people to remember that this happened," l<rnirdcl said. “These
happen a lot on this campus, and we don’t talk about them."
