Relax, this will only hurt

Sarah uswel!

During rougb rinies in my college Careelitlmes like
Monday ilirougb Friday—I ean'r lielp bur wonder ii
rliings will ever ger berrer Are all four ofrny years here
going ro be a blur ofXCroxcs and alarm clocks and s
p in. deadlines and rrain dodges and greasy food? Am i
always going so feel guilty aboui raking rime ro sleep
and car? will 1 ever ger a sense or fulfillmenrr Is it Fri-
day yet? How abour now?

wben lwas a ﬁrst year. I asked an upperelassmaii rlrose
very quesnons, andsbesaid, Donrworry,sarab firsryear
is a rough, rransrrional rims, but ilrings will ger boner next
year once you've serded down, and found a sebedule and
rimerable rbar works for you."

But rben, wben lwas a sopbomore, confused and alone
and raking Calculus, l asked again, and a junior rold me,
“Don’r worry, sarali, ir’s iusr rbe sopbomore slump, and
rliings will ger berrer next year, when you’ll ﬁnd a sense of
plaee and self."

When 1 was a innior, rired. yaded, and baving gorrcn a
o and an uleer in calculus, i asked again, and rbe senior
said, “iuiiior year, sclimoonior year."

Now 1 am a senior, and I’m srill warring for improve.
menr in rbe oualiry of my college life. l'm nor asking for
mueb, iusr maybe a mulriviramin rliar eonrains a eaffeine

awliile or a clean pair orsosks.

Burrlresad rrurb is, rbe liieofa
snidenr is a sad and arduous one in
wbieb gerring everyrbing done is
impossible, engaging in personal
liygrenc is considered a bobby, and
sleeping during class is considered
miilriraslung, lr doesn't ger berrer as
you elimb rbe grades; ir gers barder,
and you ger weaker.

However, before 1 coniinue my
dramaric lisr of complainrs, we
sbould eonsider rbe orber lifesryle
option: innabirrng rbe Real World.
Now, I’ve never cxpencnzed rbe
Real world wirliour baving my mom around. but i do
know rliar sonierliing like college that eosrs $30,000 ayear
is probably bcner rlian soinerliing like rbe Real World,
wliose admission price, dcspitc years ofinfiauon, remains

multitasking.

The life of a student is a sad
and arduous one in which
getting everything done is
impossible, engaging in
personal hygiene is consid-
ered a hobby, and sleeping
during class is considered

to be absolurely free.

oreourse, wben I ask alums wliar us like in rbe Real
World. they never really answer my onesnon as all, rbey
just say, ”Don't you ever leave: sray
on eimpus forever: I bave to go be.
fore rliey rrare ibis call, bur before I
bang rip, l wanryou ro promise me
rliar you will never rry ro find me
promise mel"

I’m nor sure, bur I’m guessing
rbar all ofrbe bearraebe and bead.
acbe diar we are going through now
is simply in prepararion for all die
