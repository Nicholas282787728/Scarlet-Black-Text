the “Daily Texan” summarizes
a recent survey made by a nae
tional magazine among college

and go to work, according to the
survey. here is what you can
expect:

You will become a profession—t
al man or an executive with a
salary of about 34,500 a year.

You will own your own home
which will have six rooms and
a monthly rental value of $84.,
You will marry only once and
will not become divorced, You
will plan to have three children
but wlll probably have only
two,

You will read most of the best
sellers, both fiction and non»
fiction. You will also read from
one to four magazines, concen—
trating on the “Reader’s Dir
gest,” “Life,” ”Time,” and "The,
Saturday Evening Post." 1

You will attend church fairly,
regularly and belong to about,
three other organizations But‘
the other organizations will have
ito do without you at about half
of their meetings. .-

You will engage In about five‘
political activities which include
reading about politics in news-‘
papers and magazines and dis-
cussing it with your friends. You
will keep up with local civic
activities and take an active part
in the civic.affairs of your com-
munity, You will also keep up
with national and international
developments, but your active
status in politics will probably
be confined to voting.

Interestingly enough, you will
not arbitrarily identify yourself
with any politicamey but will
vote according to the issue inl
any given election, I

You will have only slightly
less than four hour day to spend

club for entertainment.

Indlan Address-e; V
Siuden’rs On lnclia
And |+s Freedom

Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa, Ina
dian delegate to the Social
Commission of the United Na—
tions, spoke last Friday in con-
vocation on the recent history
of indie, ‘

He opened by remarking that,
India has now had three years
of independence. and then con—
trasted the conditions in Bom-
bay now with those of Pre—
liberation India.

The general them'e of his lec-
ture was to divide each topic
into three periods: pre»British,
during British occupation, and
after liberation, There was a
strong cultural harmony, he
stated, under the pre- tish
whereas the British den
stroyc‘cl it entirely. Now, how-
ever, harmony is returning. As
illustration, he pointed out that
under the British, no less than
565 princely states sprang up,

Economy Is Agricultural

The lndlan economy is pre
dominantly agricultural, and it
does not lend itself to mechanr
ization. The primary reason for
this is the bullock, which is so,
useful alive, and. for religious:
reasons, cannot be eaten, In-
dustrially, Kumai-appa stated,

goods are imported less than
before, American goods cannot
be bought for lack of dollars,
and India does not produce
enough for herself. As a re.
sult, her first program is an
industrial expansion to meet her
needs. '

The threat of Communism,
Kumarappa stated, will be pres-
ent until the standard of living
is raised. However, he did not
feel that India will embrace
Red beliefs, because the spirit.
ual values of Indians are too
highly developed.
