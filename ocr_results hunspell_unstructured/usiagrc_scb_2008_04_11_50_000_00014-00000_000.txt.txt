Rugby fueled by heart and tradition

BY CLAIRE REEDER

suited up in green and black strrpetl Jerseys, the Grinnell Griffins Rugby
team hit the pitch this past Sunday. The Grrffrns hold a unique niche In the
Grinncll athletics world, as players hail from both the college and the town.
Even falling to rivals River City 17712, the Grifﬁns are a team of passion
and tradition with a colorful history, propelled by intensity and heart,

in the midst ofa challenging and busy spring season, the Grifﬁns’ roster
is ever changing and made up ofplaycrs from a variety ofbnckgrounds.

“Last season we had between 2224 guys, and this year we have about 32
on our roster, but that can change right up to the minute before the game,"
said coach Eric Hnrzz, who began playing in 1993 and continues as both
player and coach otthe Gritfrns. “We're made up ofoldrtimcrs, college stu-
dents who played in high school, football and soccer players," he said. “We
even have a pro-boxer and a Grinnell High School health teacher on the
team."

The ﬂexibility and openness to any and all players—old, young, expe-
rienced or rookie—characterizes the rugby club and the rather transient
nature of the sport as a whole. The student population of the college also
presents a pool of possibility from which to recruit.

“It’s really exciting when you find a diamond in the rough, a grry that
just lights up when he hits the field,” said Hartz. “But there’s also guys that
have never played before, and it’s kind ofﬂyrby~the~scdtrofryout~pants; they
learn as they go,”

The link between “townies” and college students grows out ofthe history
of the Grinnell Grrffrns. Founded by a group ofretired us. Marines corps
in 1974, the original team name was the Grinnell Grunts, who sported their
olive green uniforms from the armed services. The term wore their jerseys
until they were so grungy that they were known as the "Grrrngies,"

Hard pressed for land that was not being farmed, the early team forged
a townrgown bond with their appeal to the college to use athletic ﬁelds
for practice and games. In return for space, the club was opened to college
students.

"I don't think there would be a team without the college," said Hartz.
“I've always said that rugby is a link between town, college students and
Grinnell as a whole."

Grinnell alum and famous pub owner Jim “limbo” Tanzsosch ’88 ten
vamped the team in the 19805 with the current kclly green and team name,
the Griffins.

The rugby community as a whole is extremely closealtnit, and extends
beyond uniting local townspeople and students here in Grinnell.

“Wherever you go, you always have that connection with other rngby
players," said Van Kenyon '10, who played both in high school and now for
the Grifﬁnst “You have the community of Grinncll College, but you also
have something outside ofit."

Rugby is a sport ofcommunity as well as tradition, such as the customary
post-match celebration at a local pub or tavern thrown by the host team.

"You ﬁght each other on the field for 80 minutes, but the mutual sense of
community, team and passion for the game it holds the whole sport togctlY
er," said Kenyont “Rugby is about playing for the team instead of individual
glory. We play to work hard, hit hard and thcn drink heavily."

The Griffins regularly face one of the approximately 30 rugby clubs in
Iowa in tournaments or single matchesThe All—Iowa Tournament on May
2.3 will be the next big competition,which the Griffins nearly won last year,
preceded by matches including the Luther college Rugby Daze Tournament
on April 19, and another home match against south Central on April 27.

Pioneers cope with uneven offense, strong pitching

BVJAI GARG

Though struggling through indoor practices and poor game conditions, the
baseball team has already managed to get 20 games under their belt, with a 12-8 rc-
cord, the Pioneers are well-positioned to ﬁnish near the top in conference this year.

Strong pitching combined with depth has to propelled the men‘s baseball team
to a record that far surpasses last years. “our starting pitching has been great," said
Brett Maioncy ’09. “our strength is honestly our depth. We are going to score a lot
of runs and days we don’t our pitching will shirt them down.”

As well as holding a 12-8 record, the Pioneers are currently 2—2 in conference.
This record comes from splitting two doubleheaders, against Monmouth and most
rccendy Knox college. However, Pioneer offense has been inconsistent.

Against Knox, the pitching only surrendered ﬁve runs over the two games, but
the offense struggled to produce runs. At the Monmouth game on March 29, the
Pioneers produced a huge win,scoring seven runs on their wlIy to a 773 victory. “The
loss against Knox was a finite," said Maloney, "But agttnst Monmouthithat was
the ﬁrst time the senior class has won away at Monmouth."

Last year, the team lost two ﬁrst team All Conference pitchers, causing the
coaches' In the conference to predict them ﬁnishing third, but the returning pitchers
have stepped up to the plate and outperformed anyones expectations Rick Bordello
’09 currently leads the Midwest Conferencc in innings pitched while compiling a
270 record with a 2,45 ERA. “It is about working hard everyday," said Bcl'dellc.
“Plus you get a little bit more confident when you are an uppctclilssmmi."

From top down in the Midwest Conference Southern Division, no team re-
mains undefeated, and the conference is open for anyonc's talting, Even still, the
Pioneers are currently tied for second, they expect nothing less tl'IrIn winning confer

once, “We have the best team in conference," said Berdclle. “Everyone on our team
believes that." Tin Grimm/IBIIre/m/I/emll drill lmllmgpmfzire indoor; ml Trrrrday ditt- rt fut/mien! tutrttro LAWRENCE SUNULONG
